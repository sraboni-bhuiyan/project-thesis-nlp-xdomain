the best part in this movie is the first one located in sicily i suppose crialese shows a good talent for photography and the movie start is delightfully surprising the rest of the story is quite boring crialese uselessly insists on stereotypical situations and characters trying to melt neorealistic suggestions and videomusic technique fellinian surrealistic remembrances and a very annoying and completely offtopic soundtrack leading the whole thing towards an end which gives you the sensation of an exaggeratedly long story cut abruptly short frankly this is a real overrated movie and crialese is a real overrated director,0
i was a kid crazy about michael jackson his music his dancing he was and is the greatest of all times few days ago a friend gave me a present moonwalker dvd i just couldnt believe it so i took my time and saw the movie again after a lot of years and it kicked me back in time i almost cried not because of michael jackson but of the good old times i remembered back than when i went to his concerts enjoying music and dancing the movie gave me some other perspective than back then when i was a kid you can truly see the parody that michael went through his life thank you michael jackson to bring me back to those great times to your great music and dancing its a shame that people has forgotten you i didnt because you gave me great moments with your music all the best to you where ever you are out there,1
this film would be particularly fun for anyone who has been in the film industry especially in any indie capacity those whose inheritance includes a film introduction may not appreciate it quite as much i am hard to please in the documentary category this doc is different though its pleasure comes from an earthy realism of indie filmmaker punks who are a hoot to be around and watch whether youve ever wondered what it is like to be in films in front of or behind the camera or whether you have worked your way through the sometimes painful and hard but rewarding indie world youll certainly get a kick out of this film,1
this film was shot on location in gerard gardens in liverpool and was the uks answer to films such as blackboard jungle the film stands the test of time quite well with all the moral stories still or even more relevant today the film feature some fine performance from some notable british actors such as david mccallum stanley baker peter cushing and anne heywood baker plays a liverpool cop assigned to juvenile liaison duties with the premise that if you catch the kids at an early age they will end up being responsible adultsbr br notable cameos in the film include freddie starr fred fowell and melvyn hayes gloria tsai chin and michael chow play brother and sister they are real life brother and sister who are caught up in an arsonists web tsai chin is still acting and can be seen in the latest nicole kidman film the interpretorbr br violent playground features a gun siege in a school so is unlikely to be shown on tv following similar events in scotland russiabr br i lived in gerard gardens where the film was shot though was not born at the time and have fond memories of the area i have recently completed a documentary on gerard gardens which includes extracts from violent playground and a small uk film coast to coast which stars lenny henry and pete postlewaite the tenements were demolished in 1987 and the films go some way in keeping the memory alivebr br there were some complaints from the residents when the film was released as the film portrayed the area in a bad light time has helped heal those woundsbr br a little gem of a film i would recommend you seek this out,1
i read on the web that this film is being remade into a theatrical feature finally its about time hollywood got their act together the big studios always frown at edgy material with oscar written all over it go figurebr br jericho mile was made ahead of its time its a masterpiecebr br michael mann a true visionary found a way to engage an audience without overindulgence peter strauss emmy award performance is probably the best character role ive seen in my filmviewing lifetime any actor who touches this role will never be the same unless an academy award is already sitting on their mantlebr br the gritty multi ethnic ensemble a backdrop for the jericho mile makes one understand the delicate social dynamics of our world this is about redemption without public validation and the power of the human spirit overcoming all barriers imagine a convict imprisoned since he was a teenager for life with no chance of parole that doesnt know he is possibly the fastest runner in the world what would you dobr br this movie makes you walk away feeling you havent been cheated on any level totally thrilling engaging emotional and a rolling stones soundtrack that kicks assbr br i always thought this would be made for the big screen cant wait in the meantime ill have to continue rewatching my weathered vhs copy ive had for many years,1
the biggest problem with in search of historic jesus is that there is very little search to it at all shicksunn produced these documentary films in the 1970s and just into the 80s which featured interviews with experts and discussion of science and facts to make a case for whatever the title of the film was looking to cash in onbr br sadly historic jesus is really little more than a thirdrate dramatization of the life of christ unlike shicksunns more superior in search of noahs ark which spends the majority of its running time discussing the possibility that the ark is resting on the earth today and where that might be this film is basically the story of jesus with no effort made to prove or disprove his existence the famed shroud of turrin is mentioned but little other detective work is given much screen timebr br for fans of these quasidocumentary films like jupiter menace and in search of bigfoot etc this movie doesnt offer much,0
tommy lee jones was the best woodroe and no one can play woodroe f call better than he not only was he the first and best he was the only person that could portray his grief and confusion it was a bad letdown and im surprised i even made myself watch it i can even begin how how pitiful they made woodroe i understand he would be old by that time but everyone knows that he would never let that pull him down the first movie was the best and the only one that ill ever watch i hope to god that no more directors plan on continuing or remaking the wonderful classic without tommy or duval without them the movies are pointless wastes of time and money for everyone including the director if you plan on making another lonesome dove movie of any kind take mine and billions of others dont waste time continuing the movies is just grinding the first one into the ground thanks,0
basically what we have here is little more than a remake of the hilarious 1970s classic kitsch horror death line which ironically was like this cobblers also partly filmed at the disused aldwych underground stationbr br making good use of the now disused jubilee line platforms at charing cross as well as the aforementioned aldwych this film contains basically the same plot dodgy murdering mad zombie in the tunnels preying on the lost passengers who have missed the last train originality is not this films strong pointbr br indeed strong points are sadly lacking the gore ranges from the poor to the unnecessarily over gory whilst the subgollum nutter is never really fully explained as seems little more than an under developed plot devicebr br franke polente has little to do with a thin script than run down a lot of tunnels and scream every so often indeed she was like pretty much everyone else in this film outacted by a small dog and a pack of tame ratsbr br if creepy films set on the london underground are your bag or you just want to play spot the tube location them pick this up on dvd when it hits a bargain bin if you are looking for classic horror go and dig up a copy of death line aka raw meatbr br if you are looking for a quality well written and acted film you will need to change trains,0
a ridiculous movie a terrible editing job worst screenplay ridiculous acting a story that is completely ununderstandablebr br if god was going to decide if movies should continue to be done judging by this one the entire world movie industry would now be deadbr br a wonderful movie to show that cinema should not be done by people who think they can make moviesbr br i am still wondering who are those two gipsy girls who show up in the movie for over half an hour and are never introduced to usbr br,0
i saw this film at the 2002 toronto international film festivalbr br this is the first indian film ive seen in the tamil language and while it does share some similarities with other indian films wonderful music and choreography sweeping storyline the director attempts more than just to entertain the film tells the story of amudha a precocious nineyear old whose parents reveal to her that she was adopted thus beginning an odyssey that takes them all from india to wartorn sri lanka gorgeous visuals mix with horrifying scenes of violence expressly to make a point though it is a simplistic one amudha is played by ps keerthana and she is one of the few child actors ive seen who can be precocious and yet not annoying her charm and beauty held the film together,1
the straight story is a truly beautiful movie about an elderly man named alvin straight who rides his lawnmower across the country to visit his estranged dying brother but thats just the basic synapsisthis movie is about so much more than that this was richards farnworths last role before he died and its definitely one that he will be remembered for hes a stubborn old man not unlike a lot of the old men that you and i probably know br br the straight story is a movie that everyone should watch at least once in their lives it will reach down and touch some part of you at least if you have a heart it will,1
this may be one of the worst movies to ever make it to production everbr br 1 the most exciting part is the beginning where the guy is walking and walking and walking spoiler there is about 15 minutes of just walking how br br 2 not to mention theres a lot of issues with the lighting and its almost like they even shot the night scenes during the day br br 3 the acting was terrible it looks like they found a community theater in mexico and then took the people who were turned awaybr br please for the love of everything holy dont rent this movie if you know someone who owns it apologize to them the director should be subject to punishment through the war crimes tribunal for foisting this on the public,0
i watch them allbr br its not better than the amazing ones _strictly ballroom_ _shall we dance_ japanese version but its completely respectable and pleasingly different in partsbr br i am an english teacher and i find some of the ignorance about language in some of these reviews rather upsetting for example the name should scream dont watch how she move since when can movie titles ignore grammar br br there is nothing inherently incorrect about caribbean english grammar its just not canadian standard english grammar comments about the dialogue seem off to me i put on the subtitles because im a canadian standard english speaker so i just automatically assumed that i would have trouble understanding all of it it wasnt all that difficult and it gave a distinctly different flavour as the other step movies i have seen were so americanbr br i loved that this movie was set in toronto and in fact wish it was even more clearly set there i loved that the heroine was so atypically cast i enjoyed the stepping routines i liked the driven mum character i felt that many of the issues in the movie were addressed more subtly than is characteristic of dance moviesbr br in summary if you tend to like dance movies then this is a decent one if you have superiority issues about the grammar of the english standard you grew up speaking your narrow mind may have difficulty enjoying this movie,1
miserable film not even to be compared in one breath with to kill a mockingbird or in the heat of the nightbr br yes there is racial prejudice but the film is at most ridiculous br br come now would you really have elizabeth patterson of all people guarding a jail so as to avoid a lynching patterson in her day played everyones mother and was the landlady in i love lucy before fred and ethel mertz bought the buildingbr br imagine exhuming the body so that it will not come out that the black mans gun killed a white manbr br claude jarman jr who was so fabulous in 1946s the yearling appears in this mess he still had those sad eyes my eyes would be sad too if i appeared in this awful filmbr br to me this was nothing more than a faulkner flop all the way,0
the animation looks like it was done in 30 seconds and looks more like caricatures rather than characters ive been a fan of scooby doo ever since the series premiered in 1969 i didnt think much of the scooby doo animated movies im talking about the tv series not the full length movies but some of them were pretty cool and i like most people found scrappy doo to be an irritant but this series is pure garbage as soon as i saw the animation and heard the characters and i use that term loosely speak i cringed also mystery inc was a team and without the entire crew to compliment each other it just seems like opening up a box of chocolates to find someone has already ate the best ones and the only thing left are the ones nobody wants whats new scooby doo was better than this if youre going to have a scooby doo tv series include the elements that made the series endure so long the entire cast of characters and quality animation they need to put this one back under the rock from where it came,0
the boys are working outside a recording studio when they hear the voice of an angel that would be miss van doren auditioning and going under the name of miss andrews because her father doesnt approve of her being a radio singer however she hopes a certain bigwig mrs bixby a friend of her dads will hire her and then he will have to give his approvalbr br she leaves but within minutes the boys are running amok in the studio causing havoc and having other musicians out to kill them after they ruin the recording session finally things calm down whew we eluded them says moe yeah we got away too answers curlybr br the boys then fool around in the studio put on miss van dorens record and curly gets dressed in womens clothes and pretends hes singing mrs bixby walks in is impressed and hires seniorita cucacha on the spot for an extra 500 shes asked to come and sing at their highsociety party that night the rest as they sayis history as curly pretends to be an opera singer with some funny results oh by the way he accompanied by senior mucho and senior gustobr br what happens at the party is simply that the truth wins out but not before a few slapstick antics take place in all a pretty good episode i enjoyed it but wouldnt rate it as anything special,1
an intense dark action drama with unusually rich support from casey keith et al many of whom get the best roles of their careers and run with it the film is oddly shaped often the action slows down just to let the characters get caught up in odd but welldone seemingly improved dialogues during the stakeouts almost all of the machine get caught up in perfectly delivered humorous monologues and reynolds the director deserves mucho credit for having reynolds the star step back and give them room and unlike most action films you really get to like the characters which makes the 2nd half when their various destinies good and bad unfold unusually affecting the combination of character development brutal violence a jazzy soundtrack tarantino must be a fan watch this then jackie brown and youll see what im talking aboutmake this occasionally flawed film the bad guys are a bit melodramatic one of the better modern cop films and in my mind superior to many of the overrated modern noirs such as body heat such,1
i was prepared for a bad movie and a bad movie it is so i guess i shouldnt complain twentysomething tom gay poster boy robert stadlober has so many issues he doesnt know if hes coming or going i wouldnt have stayed but for the pretty girls serious mavie anna brüggemann nononsense angie emma daubas sarah baumann as the star of the movie within the movie and then theres toms soul mate wildeyed margarete jana pallaske she reminds me of béatrice dalle and gina gershon if youve got to remember these are fine memories she looks good even in the most ridiculous outfits and i mean ridiculous even by berlin standards i wonder whether id have liked this movie when i was the characters age my guess is i wouldnt watch out for indie idols oli schulz and max schröder of der hund marie performing as street musicians feeling no pain,0
ok so this is coming a few weeks late but it is here mostly this is because of statements of various negative natures starting with the technology when star trek tos ran special effect technology was extreamely low tec and more than that the crew had little money to do any kind of proper mock ups in the 35 years seince tos premiered the crew of star trek have become experts at economybr br ultimately they have decided quite rightly in my mind to abandon the look of tos and reverse engineered tng et all so what if they decided not to make the transporter out of gold glitter or made the phase pistols look closer to the ones from star trek ii as for the nits being picked about first contact with the klingon empire it was presumed based upon comments made by kirk and riker that earth only met the klingons in 2200 nothing was firmly establishedbr br enterprise gives us the most promising venue of exploration that weve seen in a while this is what voyager could have been no series can evolve without a few inconsistancies but be thankful that star trek has so few so quit gripping and enjoy,1
there have been a lot of zorro films made over the decades but its a shame that one of the best is probably one of the least seenbr br zorros fighting legion is a bit different from other zorro films first off its a republic serial in 12 chapters and this time zorro is not played by a top studio star like douglas fairbanks tyrone power or antonio banderas but instead by workmanlike actor reed hadley while hadley does not cast as strong a presence over the proceedings as those other he does an adequate job helped by the fact that he is not the sole hero here as the title implies he has a fighting legion to call uponbr br another big difference is that the setting isnt california the story here take place in central mexico in 1824 where a man posing as a living god incites the indigenous indian population and a band of outlaws to aid him in his plan to overthrow the newly established mexican republic something zorro and a handful of followers plan to do anything they can to stopbr br dont get me wrong there is at least one incredibly cheesy moment per episode from corny twang bow sound effects to ludicrous acting but overall this represents one of the best republic serials of all time and probably the best zorro onebr br the plot is stronger than most serials and never becomes incomprehensible or meandering and theres lots of great action fans of the indiana jones movies will notice many bits borrowed from this serial,1
this movie is so bad you almost feel contaminated by it actually there is a strong sense of relief when its over relief that you can now put the cassette back in the rewinder and rush this back to the video rental store before it contaminates the rest of your video collection i jokingly suggested when we rented it that it looked like the kind of film where william hurt would phone in his performance i meant that he would not be trying very hard but lo and behold in a huge number of scenes in this film bill hurt is actually on the phone our realization of this irony was the only pleasure we derived from this confusing mess the cinematography and editing are murky and befuddled the story is chaotic and the soundtrack is barely audible there is a very slight resemblance to falling down but that film had a boldly disturbing storyline great writing and acting and an engaging soundtrack contaminated man is just some kind of broken down old european tourist trap and watching it is like driving along some unfamiliar back road in an unknown country where you dont speak the language in a steady rain just after nightfall as the windshield keeps fogging up you get the picture dont get this one,0
i dont know but the movie was just too similar to other movies ive seen the ring the eye dark water theyre all the same to me dont get me wrong its beautifully made lovely camera work great graphics but that story is just too too common in the end its the score that makes the suspense you know the screams rumbles the characters in the movie are also not reacting very naturally moving very slowly surprised by anything they see i know some people that love this kind of film and if you do being a well made movie i guess it doesnt hurt to watch it but if youve seen the movie ive mentioned above and didnt like them then id suggest you dont bother,0
not to waste your time watching this vanity project ive had my comment deleted twice now for reasons that i have yet to understand other than the suspicion that someone involved with gone isnt happy with what i had to say so ive pared things down to the nittygritty this time with an excerpt of my original comments that can in no way be taken as a personal attack on anyone nor unfair commentary br br gone is the sort of train wreck that gives new meaning to the words horrible stilted dialogue a script that just plain flails about like a fish out of water acting that would embarrass the most selfcentered of community theater divas cinematography inspired by the survivor school of swooping crane shots followed by static nostrilexploring closeups terrible adr work special visual effects that arent pedestrian music that totally fails to sustain any mood or emotion terrible editing with utterly pointless freezes and fades no art direction to speak ofthe litany of badness just goes on and oni felt genuinely cheated out of the time it took me to fast forward through most of ittime that could have been better spent staring at a wallunder no circumstances should anyone unfortunate enough to be reading this subject themselves to this movie because long before its over they will be wishing they had been raptured before they made that mistake br br case closed amen,0
this movie was recommended to me by some academics from their comments i had some pretty lofty expectations but this movie was nothing but disappointing the aim of the director is obviousto use an interweaving of speechespoems as a way to argue against the bush doctrine but the director fails miserably at this also i seriously question the directors choice of main character its a bum who is definitely not worthy of being heard the rise of corporation power so what most importantly this movie gets a failing score in its persuasive power its clearly intended for those whove already formed their opinions its true that the movies aesthetics are quite pleasing but pretty much everything else in the movie simply sucks,0
lazy writing bad acting and wooden direction lead us to a 2005 canadianmade tv movie called hush not to be confused with about eight other movies using the same name tori spelling and her doctor hubby move from sanfran to his small hometown where they run into his old gal pal who decides she still loves him she gets pregnant with toris baby dont ask and starts knocking off anyone who might get in her way as she plans to reunite with her old flame the actors playing the old gal pal and the doctor are not worth mentioning as they act flatter than flat tori isnt much better but at least she is something to focus on as the plot meanders here and there before arriving at a very lame and alltoofamiliar conclusion watch instead the hand that rocks the cradle,0
if youve seen other movies like this theyre probably better the omega man comes to mind to the studios credit they avoided the sprawling unnecessary big budget technofest that typifies movies of this ilk additionally the setup and premise were excellent four people whose past is virtually irrelevant to us are trying to get away from an overwhelming infectious fatal disease whats bad is everything else i get tired of endlessly stupid careless wimpy ineffective arrogant characters in a movie that pretty much describes everyone in the movie at some point i rented it and found myself yelling at the tv repeatedly no dont do that why are you so stupid look out etcetera a true lack of character development is evident about halfway in a movie should give you a strong personal connection with at least some of the characters so that you actually care what happens to them this one does not alsothere should have been a longer more involving end to the movie as well,0
im rather surprised that no reviewer so far has commented on the rather elementary chess blunder in luzhins game as white against an unnamed opponent immediately before the final despite the use of jonathan speelman as consultant chess expert luzhin is shown winning the game with an illegal move in between the rapid cuts away and back to the board it is not hard to spot that after luzhins combination culminating in a queen sacrifice his rook on d1 is still pinned by blacks rook at c1 against his king in the corner at h1 thus he is unable to play the purported mating move rd1d8 which would be illegal but hes shown doing so to rapturous applause from the audience,1
without kirsten miller this project neednt have been completed however with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is miss miller i would definitely recommend it it looked as if the other actors were only playing to her strong performance wagners dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing but his few scenes didnt detract from being entertained mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster the charismatic miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable she plays that fine line between assertive and bossy but never offensive she is in fact the structural engineer she claims to be i wish i had seen this on the big screen but alas i was fortunate to rent it before it was lost,1
red rock west is one of those rare films that keeps you guessing the entire time as to what will happen next nicolas cage is mistaken for a contract killer as he enters a small town trying to find work dennis hopper is the bad guy and no one plays them better look for a brief appearance by country singing star dwight yoakam this is a serious drama most of the time but there are some lighter moments what matters is that you will enjoy this low budget but high quality effort,1
when i first picked this film up i was intrigued at the basic idea and eager to see what would happen im a fan of animation and love it when its successfully merged with live action footage however the animation in this film was about all i enjoyed although it must be said that the actors performances were excellent the visual look including the animation gave a wonderfully unnerving air to the piece however this was quality of unease was lost amongst the overblown imagery both visual and in the script that you were practically hammered over the head with most annoying about this was the relative lack of importance to the plot it seemed that the plot was shoe horned in at irregular intervals giving a stuttering effect that detracted massively from the flow of the piece the voice overs from felisberto especially the one at the end very much felt like a desperate attempt to fill in gaping holes in the plot which had been ignored in favour of side issues such as the whole ant thing and even that wasnt properly addressed im afraid the whole piece came across as at best a reasonable first attempt by a teenager who has spent far too much time reading dh lawrence not what you expect from seasoned film makers at all,0
with various bogdanoviches and gazzaras scattered throughout cast and crew they all laughed is very much a family affairif you add the fact that bgazzara and miss ahepburn had a brief but passionate affair in an earlier picture it has the air of almost a private movie made for the enjoyment of the participants and that the entertainment of a wider audience merely an ancillary considerationif this all smacks of smug in joke self gratification you will be pleased to hear that mr bogdanovich sails well clear of that particular hazard and delivers a sweet and rather innocent i love ny paean that is also an altar at which we can worship the ethereal beauty of the late miss hepburn make no mistake this is her picturemr gazzara concedes it to her most self effacingly in all their scenes together the plot a detective agency gets involved too personally in its clients affairs is of minimal importanceit is the performance of the two leads that dominates the movie mr bogdanovichs triumph is in the way his camera seems to love his actorsfrom targets onwardsthere is a glow about every one of his films that only special artists can coax from an inanimate piece of optical equipmentmiss hepburn in particular benefits from this love extra insights into his work can be obtained from reading the published collections of his essays on stars and directorsprincipally who the hells in it recently remaindered in uk bookstores the soundtrack to they all laughed varies from louis armstrongs 1947 new york town hall concert to sinatra to country to latinas eclectic as the city it portrays mr bs golden boy image was sure to tarnishfor such is the nature of the movie businessbut it is equally sure one day to be restoredand when that day comes they all laughed will be recognised for the fine work that it is,1
to be fair i expected car chases in this film there was only really one but apart from that freeway was a great movie which i am glad to own on dvd the only really big names in the cast are homicides richard belzer as the radio psychiatrist and bmovie villain parexcellance billy drago as the revelationquoting freeway killer but the rest of the cast generally give good performances i especially liked how darlanne fluegel gave her character sunny a bit of guts she could have been a helpless victim character but she is fully rounded as she seeks out drago with the help of bounty hunter james russobr br russo im afraid comes across as rather wooden but then again the character he plays frank isnt very well fleshed out save for a back story sunny is given by his former commanding officer the tone of menace is kept up superbly throughout the film and the atmosphere of the lonely la freeway at night with the killer prowling its length in his sinister grey sedan is an excellent way of building tension and the music used to underscore the film is suitably composed i dont know why there are some people who hate this movie so different strokes for different folks i suppose but i absolutely enjoyed freeway and i can strongly recommend it,1
the action in this movie beats sunny bhai in gadar akshay kumar possess the superpowers of leonidus in 300 neo in matrix along with spiderman and superman it is hilarious except for the typical akshay kumar and anil kapoor comedy i cannot see anything positive in this film the story looks like the writer told his 10yr old son to write the movie is so unreal that anil kapoors long range shooting with a shotgun is the least most mistake by the director except for the directors tashan to make this movie there is no other tashan i regret wasting my money on this movie and i would not recommend it to anybody 110 is the least i can give on imdb or i would give it a zero,0
well let me put it this way i have always been one of the hardcore brothers ive always loved rock music and especially heavy metal thats why this movie is like a gift from god i believe this movie is one of the best movies ever well except from neverending story and star wars of course its great to hear all the classics like long live rock and roll dio stranglehold ted nugent songs by jon bon jovie deep purple acdc zakk wylde and several other legendary rock bands heavenly absolutely gorgeous wonderful i hope they will make more movies like this otherwise its just crap movies like that ac in da usa or what they call it and 8 miles bulls well i strongly recommend this anyway everything im missing is a couple of stratovariussongs but except from that its one of the best movies ever ten out of ten,1
i sat down to watch this film with much trepidation and little hope i didnt think it would be possible for this film to live up to its subject matter but it absolutely did and then some first i must say that jared harris did an extraordinary job as john lennon at times it seemed that harris was channeling lennon the resemblance was often uncanny and he clearly studied lennons mannerisms and vocal inflections aiden quinn was quite good as mccartney also bearing a striking resemblance to macca although he did occasionally trip over his scouse accentbr br this work of fiction was wellwritten and welldirected it was pure fantasy of course but sometimes i felt like a voyeur peeking through a keyhole at this reunion the rooftop scene was especially moving as mccartney told lennon what he had never heard as a childthat he was worthy and important and it could never be his fault that he was abandoned by his parents i also enjoyed the scene in the park where the pair of them danced with absolute abandon to the reggae bandbr br my one complaint would be this i am not so sure that john was as caustic as he was portrayed in the film at this stage in his life he had settled in to his domestic situation quite nicely and he was actually known to be quite friendly when approached by fans only a few years later he was very friendly when he was first approached by his assassin for an autograph on the day he was murderedbr br mostly this film served to stir up those feelings again about what might have been had john lived a bit longer i am quite sure the beatles would have come back together at some stage and i am quite certain that lennon and mccartney would still be friends todaybr br well done vh1 i will watch it again and againbr br,1
perhaps the most polished and accomplished of all indian films pakeezah does not fall into any of the traps commonly associated with bollywood film ie tackiness farce wholesale and unsuccessful imitation of western film themesgenres pakeezah is indigenous to the subcontinent and authentic almost madam butterflylike in plot characters are welldeveloped direction although sometimes unrefined by todays standards perceptive and convincing the urduspeaking milieux at the time of pakeezah were masters of understatement and how the dialogue conveys the subtleties of the age the acting particularly the looks and the dynamic between characters are a delight to behold although the nuances may be lost on contemporary viewers or those not acquainted with the mores and customs of muslim indiabr br coupled with a captivating screenplay is a beautiful musical score enhanced by the protagonist displaying eminent command of classical indian dance kathak as is the case with most romantic tragedies the heroine must die but she does not take her leave of the audience without the viewer feeling heshe has been party to a truly memorable cinema experience pakeezah is surely the pinnacle of what indian cinema has produced and is unlikely to be paralleled,1
this is one of lhs shorts most frequently cited as the first real lh teaming and perhaps one of their best silent features j piedmont mumblethunder ollie is a millionaire who has come to the docks to greet his nephew philip whom hes never seen at first ollie is laughing it up with everyone when this strange little man unboards and draws a great deal of attention to himself by the way hes behaving during his medical exam but is quite humiliated when it turns out that this is the fellow hes supposed to be greeting he has been told that philip is a good boy but he has one weaknesswomen mumblethunder and philip set off to go home but their journey there is continually interrupted by philip breaking into a little dance every time he sees a woman then chasing after the woman huge crowds gather each time this happens not so much because hes chasing skirts but because philip himself is also wearing a skirt a kilt finally mumblethunder manages to drag philip into a tailors shop to be measured for a proper pair of pants but philip escapes from there as well to chase more skirts there are lots of laughs all around its also nice to see a short like this because the boys arent exactly the characters we know and love ollie is pretty much his usual character but its such a joy to see stan acting so differently from his usual manchild character it shows he wasnt a onetrick pony and excelled in other types of roles when he got the chance with a run time of 19 minutes its short and sweet providing classic one liners which still have me in stitches,1

oh mr carell how far youve fallen after a glowing moment in little miss sunshine steve carells choice of films is beginning to contrast starkly with what has come since although the 40 year old virgin was entertaining it was dwarfed by his sunshine character hoping to find something thatd get me to spew popcorn from my nose i decided to rent evan almighty and see what possible guffaws might await me here not muchbr br given the trite and clichéd script the entire film felt forced and unemotional poking a bit of fun at flagging family values and the current us administrations take on the environment evan almighty also tries to put a profound biblical moment into humorous terms but fails miserablybr br nearly every person on earth knows the story of noah and the ark gods wrath was sent down with 30 days and nights of rain which flooded the entire planet while noah his family and two of each of his creatures on earth rode out the wetness in relative comfort via the gopher wood ark it was a huge moment in human history if you believe the biblical textbr br so why would god appear to one man and ask him to build an ark that would only carry the worlds animals for a few minutes after a dam break the simple answer is that he never would too much emphasis was given to us government policy and not enough on world events making evan almighty a terribly myopic and americentric film although designed as a comedy it really never reaches anything approaching belly laughs maybe a few grunts and a smile but little elsebr br john goodman cars pulls in another forced performance as the despicable congressman chuck long whos only goals are to create development opportunities on protected national land holdings even the strong presence of morgan freeman 10 items of less as god cant help mop up this soaking wet disasterofafilmbr br the only funny moments are between carell and the animals especially as evan learns what animal magnetism is really like birds literally flock to him sheep herd around him lions take pride in being near him please forgive the punsbr br the special effects were fun to watch but were brief with good reason the flood was interesting in that the ark was obviously guided by his hand and shoved in just the right directionbr br but other than that youre in for little more than an insult to common sense and intellect,0
i like david hamiltons artistic photographs of nude women at the border of womanhood sometimes erotic though never pornographic someone else liked them too because my david hamilton books were stolen in one book were seen a few pictures of a young boy obviously nude intimate with a young woman older than he also nude though discrete there was strong sexual connotation new territory for david hamilton which proved to be either stills from the movie tendres cousines or perhaps photos taken on setbr br the art of still photography unfortunately does not automatically translate to cinematography soft focus becomes outoffocus and discrete angles become confusing perhaps because in motion they cannot be considered you either see it or miss it and theres no time to observe to comprehend the movie is supposed to be a farce and funny things do happen but it doesnt hang together perhaps because the story develops so slowly and one may wonder just whats going on eventually the 14yearold julien has intercourse with his cousin but its soft core with no genital contact shown on camera since its a farce we have a disappointing virgin and an embarrassing caught in the act gag and having caught them juliens father even gives him a cigarette to complete the experience in fairness the film is in french and conforms to french cinematic forms which may just be too subtle for most americans even with english subtitles to help us phillistines alongbr br its been suggested that this film is child pornography and that certainly results from todays climate where sexual exploitation of children is clearly a serious problem nobody in their right mind wants to endorse or appear to endorse the sexual abuse of children so theres practically no room left for children to be seen in even the mildest erotic context without immediately activating alarms over sexual violence and exploitation guys will think lucky julien even as they agree that sex and children in the movies is a bad thing all the while still wishing they could have been a julien at that age women too may have similar thoughts but all such considerations must be pushed out of ones conscious mind hysterically the worst assumptions have become automatic and matters of children and sex are rigorously avoided too bad since sexual awakening is a real human experience afer all children do grow up and become sexual beings as julien does its a fit literary subject cinema included but taboo under the threat of sexual violence against children david hamilton i think was taking a risk to make a movie on this topic even in 1980 he was somewhat successful at exploring this sensitive topic and unfortunately were unlikely to see better in the near future for fear of the child pornography label,1

this is not horror as the first part was this is campy light and humorous entertainment like in so many sequels the action starts right away with no explanations but theres boobs so i dont complain and real boobs that is if i understand correctly those are quite rare today amongst the teenage girls in us of a which brings to my mind the fact that the main actress here is pamela bruces sister springsteenbr br this cannot be thought without the first movie so i compare this to it again there is too small clothing mainly pants and funny hair its not hard to tell what decade this film is made in again there is really strange characters this time even more visibly pathological ones especially the personnel of the camp its like some mental rehabilitation summer camp people are older most of the actors must be at least 25 but i think theyre supposed to be 16 or something some methods used by the evil dyke are quite unpleasant actually this movie dont have much in common with the first part and this is worse than it in every way,0
finally a true horror movie this is the first time in years that i had to cover my eyes i am a horror buff and i recommend this movie but it is quite gory i am not a big wrestling fan but kane really pulled the whole monster thing off i have to admit that i didnt want to see this movie my 17 year old dragged me to it but am very glad i did during and after the movie i was looking over my shoulder i have to agree with others about the whole remake horror movies enough is enough i think that is why this movie is getting some good reviews it is a refreshing change and takes you back to the texas chainsaw first one michael myers and jason and no cgi crap,1

slaughter high the tale of revenge by a nerdy guy who fell victim to one of the coolest and coldest jokes in cinema history unfortunately after the promising opening the flick went straight to hell a very tedious and redundant mess with mediocre slashings and a final half hour that sucked on a whole new level of suckiness the guy who played the nerd actually killed himself shortly after the flick was released if you wanna rent the flick stop it after the prank and remember choose life,0
tu pa tam is one of the worst movies ive ever seen but on the other hand is better then most of the movies from slovenia who are filled with depressing characters and story without any bright ideas tu pa tam is bright optimistic and without any artistic moments in many interviews director mitja okorn tried to tell us that his movie is top quality just because it didnt cost a lot of money but thinking that way is wrong tu pa tam is for me very bad movie the dialogs are really bad written 90 of the script is consisted of cursing the characters are stereotypical morons the story and its twists are very predictable and the action sequences this movie supposed to be an action comedy are filmed very very bad and without any style okorn is just thinking hes even bigger than quentin tarantino so hes copying his style over all 90 minutes the humor in the movie is very cheap and primitive okorn probably thinks that constant cursing is funny in my opinion is tu pa tam very cheap not only by budgetmovie with stupid story and very very bad acting,0

nacho libre 2006 br br directed by jared hess br br starring jack black ana de la reguera héctor jiménez darius rose br br mpaa rating pg13 for some rough action and crude humor including dialog br br say what you will about it i know some people who despise it to no end but i have always thought that napoleon dynamite was a funny movienot the brightest brick on the wall but a funny movie nonetheless jack black is also a very funny manirritating at times yes and massively overrated by adolescent audiences who practically worship him but funny there has rarely been a jack black comedy that i did not enjoy to some degree so i was very happy to hear that jared hess the writer and director of napoleon dynamite and jack black would be teaming up for a movie about a spanish friar who becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage my only reservation was that the plot seemed a little too thin unfortunately my one reservation turned out to be downfall of the entire movie this plot had it been done as a skit on some such show as saturday night live or possibly even mad tv would have worked flawlessly unfortunately the plot runs far too thin over the approximate one and a half hour runtime and this onejoke comedy falls flatbr br nacho was raised in a mexican monastery and became a devout man of the lord feeling shunned by the entire monastery nacho black now the monasterys cook decides to follow his dreams to become a professional wrestler as the monasterys finances hit an alltime low nacho decides to join a wresting tournament so that he can win the prize money and provide good food for the monasterys orphanage this plot sounds so sweet and caring it seems like the perfect movie for jack black look what he did with school of rock after all well to my displeasure this plot is almost completely ruined by offensive and gross humor that just takes away from the heart of the movie it is again hollywoods way of showing that they feel that teen audiences will only understand fart jokes and stupid humor of course for all i know maybe that is the general thought of teenagers as many seemed to enjoy this movie watching an obese woman scurry like a mouse across the floor will certainly make people laugh but dont expect to get an award for putting it in your movie a sevenyearold could make up the same jokebr br the performances in nacho libre are actually good jack black proves once again that he is absolutely hilarious and that he can make even the most idiotic worthless lines in ever put on paper comical unfortunately this movie just wasnt enough for him it didnt give him anything to go on and the only reason any of his jokes worked was because of him i had never seen or heard of ana de la reguera before but now i can say that not only,0
i first saw this one afternoon in the 80s on network tv i think i was like 9picture seeing a violent horror flick nowadays on regular television anyway ive seen it again years later and its like i rememberedits really goodscary flick i think the reason why it might of gone unnoticed is cause it wasnt followed by a load of sequels ie friday the 13th but its one of those movies that takes the original idea and does it better even though this is a killer in the woods flick like fridayit has more in common with the original texas chainsaw massacrethats because the movie lays down a certain atmosphere and feeling of dreadeven in broad daylight and the killers feel more threatening than in friday theres also a good amount of suspense i recommend seeing it now that its being released on dvd in late july,1
lowrent version of ashley judds double jeopardy sutherland is too professional to be bad but what was brigit fonda thinking the penelope ann miller curse continues think about itwhen has she ever been in a good movie other than other peoples money and im not saying shes bad but all of her movies fail in some way,0
spoilersbr br this is one bad movie seriously acting in absolutely horrible the fx are dreadfull and the plot is down right awful but hey its so bad that its fun watching the script is so bad that its enjoyable you just have to cringe and laugh at lines such as i guess thats what you call crocteasing as the women flash their breasts at the crocodile i mean come on thats funny cause its so bad it has such horrible jokes that theyre funny but after a while it just becomes to much as the movie turns into crap i really started to fall asleep trust me though the plastic croc foot stamping on the leaves and the constant swishes of a crock tail well keep you laughing for a long time though i have to say it had one cool part when the croc ripped that dude in half and he just hung there for a while figuring out what to do heh heh mindless movie which has to be nominated for the mst3k line,0
its only 2 episodes into a 5 part drama but i can already state that this is one of the best things ive ever seen thats on tv silver screen or even in real lifebr br as a writer its so good its almost demoralising as a viewer its so entertaining that im annoyed the episodes are over a fortnight instead of monday to friday its clear that all these negatives are actually positivesbr br im a modern guy who previously turned over from tv dramas in comparison to movies tv dramas always seemed to be dated quite tame and well generally boring five days has really brought tv drama into the 21st century so for me at least its mind changing go watch it,1
this film has all the size and grandeur of many of the great biblical epics of the 1950s and 60s but it is also perhaps the first that really humanizes the biblical characters themselves the best thing about it is that it does not diminish them in the eyes of the viewer this is a unique and compelling balance that helps us to realize that even great people like david are flawed people who find their faith and greatness in facing their flawsbr br the actors are all first rate in the film from gilbert barnett as davids second son absolom through to the wonderful susan hayward as bathsheba hayward is at her best in this film her own truthful but larger than life style of acting is quite at home here she is ever the seductress but she plays the role in such a way that you sympathize with herbr br raymond massey does a great job as nathan the prophet as a child when i first saw the film massey seemed like he truly had just conversed with the lord himself and was an awesome sight no doubt helped also by the great music composed by the always amazing alfred newman who also had great successes in other biblical epics like the robe and the greatest story ever told along with perhaps 100 other films too the cinema photography by leon shamroy is well done and adds to the size but also the intimacy of the film henry king a truly underrated film director who like william wyler never really pigeonholed himself into any one genre pulls together a larger than life production that never loses sight of the love story between david and bathsheba and davids own deep struggle with his faith in god the path tread in this film could have been very hokey but king keeps it real and interesting all the way plus we never lose the sense of mystery about trying to understand the will of god just as david himself is struggling with the same from the first scene where a soldier dies trying to save the ark from destruction david is not satisfied with nathans answer to paraphrasethat no one can understand the will of god this is the journey we embark on right through to the powerful ending where david is finally confronted with himselfbr br finally this film belongs to gregory peck who wonderful as king david his david is a man you can believe could rule a country ruthlessly but was at one time a faithful singer of psalms this is one of his best performancesbr br i dont see this movie on television much anymore but when i do i never fail to watch it i think it still holds up very well today,1

i am a big fan of the spaghetti western genre and i usually also like most of the cheaply made ones infamous director demofilo fidani however is rightly known for some of the cheapest trashiest and well worst contributions to the genre the plots of fidanis movies were usually very weak and since his talent was quite limited he usually tried to sell the movies by adding famous spaghetti western names like django of sartana to the titles i the particular case of giù la testa hombre of 1971 he just took the title of sergio leones giù la testa aka duck you sucker and added hombre the movie can be found under various titles fistful of death western story i personally bought it under the name adios companeros which this movie shares with another fidani film with almost the same cast per una bara piena di dollari which is also entitled adios companeros in the german language versionbr br the plot is rather weak it basically follows a guy named macho callaghan jeff cameron and his involvement with two rivaling outlaw gangs lead by butch cassidy jack betts and ironhead gordon mitchellbr br the leading performance by jeff cameron is kindly stated not very convincing neither did i find jack betts very good as butch cassidy bmovie legend gordon mitchell however is always worth a try and although he probably wasnt a very good actor i always found his performances in the spaghetti westerns quite funny and original and he actually saved some of fidanis movies such as the rather crappy django and sartana showdown in the westbr br there is one very funny and original thing about giù la testa hombre the great klaus kinski is playing a priest i could have imagined kinski in any role but before seeing this movie i would never have guessed that anybody would cast him as a priest kinski is once again great although he has only little screen time and one scene where he breaks up a fight is probably the only good scene in this one more interesting thing about this film is that the legendary director and king of sleaze joe damato did the cinematographybr br giù la testa hombre is a cheap crappy film but nevertheless it has some funny moments being a spaghetti western enthusiast i found it fun to watch but if youre not never mind this movie or watch it only for the purpose of seeing kinski play a priest 310,0
i suppose the ultimate curse of attending the toronto film festival is your release date time table get messed up quite frankly im just happy fido got picked up for us distribution in any casebr br ever seen shaun of the dead good how about lassie able to reconcile the two well if you can your name might be andrew currie canadian helmer of the first ever family themed zombie comedy or zomedy seriously thats what the press book in toronto called it though not as violent dry or british as shaun of the dead fido remains true to its roots a devotion to old 50s black and white television including both lassie and the infamous scifi pulp that was being pumped out during the periodbr br fidos talented headliners carrie anne moss billy connelly dylan baker and tim blake nelson stand as a testament to the brilliance of the script the film explores all the implications of its premise a world where zombies have been converted to servants because of the sheer number of them due to a strange accident what would you use your new undead servant for a butler manual labor a pet unspeakable acts fido tackles all these possibilities in a sweet and surprisingly classy way with much thanks to the work of connelly as one of said zombies and young tv actor ksun ray who seems at times to be a better young elijah wood than the young elijah wood wasbr br if youre expecting another shaun of the dead dont waste your time theres not nearly enough gore and pokes at the genre to satisfy you and youll just leave the theater bitter and depressed but if youre willing to take a look at what happens to shaun of the dead when it jumps across the lake youre in for a treat think of fido as the sensitive more often beaten up little brother to shaun of the deads rebellious loser and youre starting to get the drift if you like or at least tolerate zombies small children and loads of deadpan satire fidos the film for you if thats not the casewell you know the drill just hit em square between the eyes,1

this movie has the made for tv stink all over it though it started out with great intentions featuring great looking sets and authentic props and costumes the film quickly degenerated into horrible on the nose cheesy dialogue and rushed tv sappy melodramatic acting the characters were so sappy that at times i thought that they are about to degenerate into a bilious puddle of goo and the action was so convoluted and poorly cut that it looked as it the soldiers were merely standing around and taking turns shooting at one another the germans were so unrealistically depicted that it was painful to watch the only thing that the german officers talked about was how wonderful the americans are please take my word for this i am a huge fan of the war genre and this movie is crap nevertheless this dvd does have an excellent extra feature covering letters from the wwi front lines thus making this rental not a total waste of my time,0
those of the instant gratification era of horror films will no doubt complain about this films pace and lack of gratuitous effects and body count the fact is the empty acre is a good a example of how independent horror films should be donebr br if you avoid the indie racks because you are tired of annoying teens or twenty somethings getting killed by some baddie whose backstory could have come off the back of a count chocula box the empty acre is the movie for youbr br set in the decaying remnants of the rural american dream the empty acre is the tale of a young couple struggling with the disappearance of their sixmonthold baby as the couples weak relationship falls apart a larger story plays out in the background at night a shapeless dark mass seethes from a sun baked barren acre on their farm and seemingly devours anything in its path leaving no sign that it was ever therebr br the film is loaded with enigmatic characters and visual clues as to what is happening and ends with a well executed ending that resonates with just enough left over questions to validate the writerdirectors faith in an intellectual audiencebr br there seems to be a subtext concerning the death of the american dream but i would hardly call the film an allegory riveting well acted and technically astute the empty acre is a fantastic little indie that thinking horror fans should love,1
the basic hook here is lincoln is slow it is his slowness that represents his thoughtfulness and deliberation making him a great leader who is here engaged in singlehandedly civilizing the american frontier through the grand instrument of law all that john ford hooey and more including one lurking slave and extraneous death by injun however the slow conceit is also at the center of one brilliant piece of moviemaking funny and moving at extremes the history may be bunk but the telling of it suggests a view of history as process that inspires some excitingly trueseeming moments check out henry fondas big introductory stroll across the deck his shockingly beautiful second visit with his girl by the river his dalliance with mary todd on the porch and the priceless business that follows maam weve got to hurry things do thin out once we settle into the big courtroom drama but fonda is priceless throughout,1
the credits at the end read all directed by shigeru izumiya thats a fitting way to phrase it because it seems like filmed material from several projects were thrown together somehow barely even attempting to make it all form one consistent work it more felt like one of those music clip things that are marketed as feature films to cash in on those video commercials just that here we have the marketable music and the live performances missing except for one scene which may as well be marketed as a weird music video clip in japan whateverbr br it makes zero sense visually it isnt too special either although it has its moments for example the female creature with the death powder who is strapped onto a bed base and some morphing sht throughout and it certainly has an industrialy feeling to it usually id call the effects dilettantish but what this film offers in this regard is baffling more than anything else you remember those cheap video effects from 70s and 80s music videos that make them look so dated like a picture within a picture flying through the screen there is quite a lot of these kind of effects in this and without any apparent reason the most halfassed seeming effort comes in the form of a picture collage the pictures sort of look like album covers whateverbr br i dont know whats up with the subtitles of the version i saw the chinese ones or whatever those hieroglyphics are sometimes seem to show up when nothing is even said and the english ones often show up without the chinese ones the english subs talk much about life without death is it possible and a mind without a body which provides what comes closest to a comprehensible conflict between characters in this film one guy a scientist dude says that life without flesh is death while another guy a metamorphosing dude who claims his mind is beyond his body now that he got the death powder blown into his face and that he now knows the secrets of the flesh and whatnot metamorphosing dude is visibly pssed off about the scientist dudes claim whateverbr br erm the end all written by perception de ambiguity,0
i rented this thinking it would be pretty good just by the cover of the movie case judge and jury started out pretty good killer chasing the man who killed his wife on a bike with a cool gun but this movie got progressively stupider as it went on david keith is awesome actor especially when he plays a role like this too bad the movie was a piece of crap it really wasted his talent judge and jury was well plain dumb i gave it a 3 should have gave it a 2 i gave it an extra star just because david keiths gun was cool,0
its about jealousy its about racism its about manipulation but the underlying message is love geoffrey sax tried to pull off shakespeares othello by bringing it to modern day context however the actors were not convincing enough to pull this off there were extra bodies to help put everything in to perspective however john othello played by eamonn walker over reacted a lot in this film causing for the down fall of keeley hawes dessie brabant eventually ending in dessies death br br ben jago played by christopher eccleston was seen as the main character in the film he didnt give enough evidence for dessie to be cheating on othello with michael cass played by richard coyle instead he just played a friend to all and gave one reason as to why she was cheating in the play it took a lot more convincing from iago to make othello even suspect anything this change made the movie more about rage for the wrong reasons than what the book was based off of however the movie did have a few good points it turned the army scenes into more a racist group toward blacks where othello is the main chief of the police squad these scenes are made believable by the raging crowds and burning fires you are able to sense the amount of racism in the movie more so than you can in the book this book plays up the modern day scenes by making it much easier to understand than the shakespearian times it was written in in the play iago jago gets tortured at the end but in the film he gets his satisfaction and gets othellos position he never gets what he deserves and is never caught for telling the lie to othello until it is too late i saw this as a downfall in the movie because i feel that the villain is granted his treasure of the promotion out of lying and in the book he is found out by rodrigo overall the movie could have done a better job based on the play than what it did i feel that the director of the movie left out some of the most important parts of the play that were mentioned or there to make the play flow or make it more of a tragedy i would say that you should read the book first in order to understand all of the events that happened in the movie otherwise you may find yourself lost and confused,0
it was almost unfathomable to me that this film would be a bust but i was indeed disappointed having been a connoisseur of pekinpah cinema for years i found this dvd drastically reduced for sale and thought it was worth a shot the opening few credits iconic to pekinpah fans has the intercutting between man and animal but here we have nondiegetic ambient noise of children playing in a schoolyard while a bomb is being planted fantastic suspense then when the perps caan and duval travel to their next mission duval drops the bomb on cann that his date last night had an std found only by snooping through her purse while cann was being intimate with her the ensuing laughter is fantastic and is clearly paid homage to in brian depalmas dressed to kill at the shortlived expense of angle dickenson the problem with the killer elite is that after the opening credits the film falls flat even bring me the head of alfredo garcia has stronger production value a bold call for anyone who knows what im talking about i use pekinpahs credits as supplementary lecture material but once they are finished turn the killer elite off,0
the rap the book this movie was based on was one of the most difficult books ive ever read yet i could not put it down raunchy crude foul lewdyou name it it had it it also had some of the best characterizations of any novel ive ever readbr br well as for the flickit was deplorable i mean tim mcintire as wasco wasco was the baddest muthatalking bout wascomcintire as wasco is like casting tim conway as charles mansonbr br what happened to the main character in the book little arv he doesnt even exist in the moviefast walking was not the main dude in the book why even name credit this thing with the rap none of the spirit atmosphere nastiness or drama of the book was captured in this moviebr br for me it was not only a disappointment but a total waste of time and celluloid,0
8 simple rules is a funny show but it also has some life lessons especially one mature lesson about moving on after a lose which was the episode where paul died which was the first episode i have ever watched of the show that comes on abc the hennessy clan mother cate katey sagal daughters bridget kaley cuoco and kerry amy davidson and son rory martin spanjers look to one another for guidance and support after the death of paul john ritter the family patriarch cates parents james garner and suzanne pleshette lend a hand i am glad later in the 2nd season of this show they decided to put david spade in this show since he was done with the nbc series just shoot me but all and all this show is pretty good this show reminds me a lot of the classic family sitcoms from the 80s and 90s that used to be on abc,1
infamous horror films seldom measure up the hype that surrounds them and i have yet to come across a worse offender than wes cravens the hills have eyes having held back from watching this for years i was really pleased when i got it for christmas and waited for an evening when my girlfriend was out to settle down and watch it knowing her extreme dislike for anything genuinely horrifying i neednt have botheredbr br after a promising if familiar start that firmly sets the film in the desolution usa world of survival horror things rapidly go to pieces when the protagonists and antagonists meet in the deserted wastelandbr br looking like it was shot on a budget of 5 with the cannibal clans costumes hired from a dodgy fancy dress shop that specialises in faux caveman and red indian attire the story follows an annoying bunch of unsympathetic wasps who take a detour on a road trip to california to look for a silver mine in a nuclear testing zone when they break down they are set upon by the local family of flesheaters and have to fight to survivebr br while hoping for another deliverance texas chainsaw massacre wrong turn or devils rejects i actually realised id stumbled across something that should have remained dusty and unwatched in a backstreet video stores bargain binbr br with gallons of tomato ketchup for blood and a couple of gruesome wound closeups i can kind of see how an 18 certificate in the uk is justified but with those closeups trimmed this wouldnt have looked out of place as a saturday afternoon thriller on itvbr br the whole silver minenuclear test site subplot is just a mcguffin to justify pitching the civilised family against the primitives but given how easily the savages get their asses whupped it stretches credibility to think that they had survived for a generation preying on passersbybr br and then theres the ending or lack thereof the hills have eyes seems to be missing either a third act or at the very least a satisfying denouement instead i was just left wondering yeah and,0
i was reviewing some old vhs tapes i have and came across the tv show john denver the muppets a christmas togetherthis made me go to my computer and look it up to see if i could find a dvd version of this show to buy i was disappointed not to be able to find it yet on dvd the show aired in 1979 and was a delightful show i have the record and the cd but i would love to buy a dvd version of this show the tape is old and picture quality is pretty good but fading the sound is not as good as the cd there is also a few other songs not put on the cd as a fan of john denver and of the muppets a dvd of this show would really be a good seller if you dont have the cd it is a wonderful chritmas collection of songs taken from that show the album is also good if you can find it and still have a record player to play it on,1
why remake the original assault to my mind assault was carpenters true masterpiece it had all the elements good carpenter movies contain external threat on a small group of individuals people taking the challenge because they are forced to do so isolation just remember the guns in carpenters original made no sound being thus a lot more threatening than conventional devices and now this remake concentrating on main character is psychology and on his relation to main character ii the evil but honorable the anonymous threat in the carpenter movie replaced by a rather conventional conspiracycorruption background the remakers just didnt understand the main plot of the original and thus produced something pretty ordinary,0
i rented it because the second segment traumatized me as a little kid i snuck downstairs really early one morning started watching hbo and the raft segment 2 terrorized me good this time around i still enjoyed the raft although i couldnt tell whether it was for nostalgic reasons or if it was actually a good short the other two segments were complete trash i cant believe a producer somewhere payed to make this junk all ive accomplished by watching this was to ruin one more childhood memory creepshow 2 will now join rad among my list of tainted childhood classics 410,0
kenneth branagh attempts to turn william shakspeares obscure rarelyproduced comedy into a 1930sera musical with the result being both bad shakespeare and bad musical comedy as the actors are rarely adept at one or the other of the two styles and in some cases flounder badly in both particularly painful is nathan lane who seems to be under the impression that he is absolutely hysterical as costard but is badly mistaken and alicia silverstone who handles the shakespearean language with all the authority of a teenaged valley girl who is reading the script aloud in her middle school english classbr br the musical numbers are staged with the expertise of a high school production of dames at sea leaving the cast looking awkward and amateurish while singing and dancing with the lone exception being adrian lester who proves himself a splendid song and dance man the only other saving grace of the film are natascha mcelhone and emily mortimers contribution as eye candy but they have given far better performances than in this film and youd be wise to check out some of the other titles in their filmographies and gives this witless mess a pass,0
i had high hopes going to see this as i always enjoy paul bettanys performances i thought he was very good as darwin and did his best considering the terrible material he had to work withbr br darwins book on the origin of species was one of the most groundbreaking controversial and innovative publications ever yet youd never think it based on this tedious movie its like a twohour episode of a soap opera in a victorian setting there is virtually nothing about darwins fiveyear voyage on the beagle to the galapagos islands for example surely of supreme significance to the story as it was from his investigations of the wildlife thereon that he began to form his theory of evolutionbr br this is just one long dreary domestic drama with darwin portrayed as a slightly loopy eccentric seeing visions of his dead daughter everywhere and being given the cold shoulder by his emotionallyconstipated wife jennifer connellys portrayal of emma darwin is nothing short of awful and bears little relation to historical descriptions of the real emma there could have been an opportunity here to present the creationist interpretation of life on earth from either emma or from the local priest as played by jeremy northam a blinkandyoudmissit part which is a complete waste of a talented actor to act as a counterbalance to darwins views but it wasnt taken up br br the story focused too much on endless mawkish sentiment about darwins grief for his daughter annie and too much time was also wasted in darwin wondering whether or not to write his book eventually i was so bored it was difficult to care br br all in all this was a bit like making a movie about picasso and spending two hours concentrating on him having a fight with his girlfriend and not bothering to mention that he was an artist,0
i saw this not too long ago and i must say this movie is terrible i watch crappy movies for fun scarecreow is not fun scarecrow is stupid you have an incredibly corny villain that enjoys screaming awful puns as he kills his victimsactually worse than the one contained in this sentence he has his hard luck story that he uses to justify his killings everyone picks on me the only girl that thinks im not trailertrash likes one of the guys that pick on me i want to kill everybody wah ok im exaggerating but the premise to this movie alone is enough to put it near the bottom of the list of crappy moviesbr br adding to what i just said the kids mom is promiscuous he walks in on his mother and her current boyfriend getting it on moms boyfriend tells him to leave kid refuses insisting that he isnt going to leave his own house boyfriend chases kid into corn field he kills kid right in front of mom mom screams in terror boyfriend is like omg i didnt mean to then he tells mom not to say anything to the police about it kid was killed under a scarecrow though so like any kid who gets murdered under a scarecrow he comes back as a killer scarecrow with a vengeance his victims havent been stalked like this before scarecrows official tag linebr br to make matters worse this movie was filmed in a whopping 8 days thats right 8 days i was going to give this movie a 2 because in spite of itself it has one or two redeeming moments theyre spoilers so i wont spoil it for you if you actually want to see this crap i could have somewhat forgiven the bad acting the horrible special effects the abysmal script and the bad camera work but i simply have no respect for lack of effort on that levelbr br this movie isnt nearly as good as im making it out to be if you want to see an example of how not to make a movie or if you enjoy watching bad movies like i do then watch this at your own risk everyone else should stay a safe distance away from this movie at all times,0
this incredibly overrated anime television series 26 episodes 25 minutes each is about a 14yearold boy and two of his girl classmates who pilots a giant robot to defend japan against invading beings called angels there is very little explanation given to the angels or why their numbers have increased in recent times and they just seem to pop out of nowhere for no apparent reason why not attack all at once instead of at spaced out intervals that are convenient for the humans youre attempting to destroy the robot fight scenes attempt to employ a variety of obstacles but the action itself is poorly executed and boring to watch almost every episode seems like a waste of space where nothing of interest occursbr br some might be intrigued by fans who mention the very few symbolic references herein but thats all they are shallow oneliners to religious or philosophical concepts that are randomly tossed in with zero craftsmanship as a whole the series is incredibly tedious due to the superficiality of the characters who are really nothing more than selfpitying crybabies the psychology is pathetic with hopelessly simplistic conflicts like i hate my father repeated over and over and over and over again with no progression beyond their face value its no understatement to say that these characters plunge this series from timewasting mediocrity to angerinducing garbage during the final episodes with their endless angstridden diatribes of excessively repetitive psychobabble some of which is totally meaninglessbr br im not kidding when i say that this series just got worse and worse as it progressed every day id look at the dvd set sitting on my living room table and say to myself damn ive gotta watch the next episode at some point sigh i may as well slug through another one tonight the real kicker was that the episodes were only 25 minutes long yet they were somehow able to digress into a completely uninteresting borefest within the opening 10 minutes this is coming from a guy who will happily sit through 150minute films with glacial pacing so my criticism of this series is most damning indeedbr br never in my entire life have i despised watching a series as much as evangelion i had already purchased it based off of all the fanatical comments on imdb and i certainly wasnt going to let it collect dust after spending my hardearned money what followed was 10 hours of pure unmitigated torture my lovehate relationship with anime is turning into a hatelove relationship after this highly acclaimed disasterbr br evangelion represents everything anime should not be massive quantities of dull pretentious tripe under the guise of intelligent cinema the universal acclaim for this piece of crap is simply unbelievable and the ridiculous assertions by fans that this series as one of mankinds greatest achievements is probably the most stupifying comment ive ever heard on imdb and ive seen some doozies,0
this film is about a group of extra terrestrial gay black men exterminating females on earth in order to create a gay universebr br i watched it with the intent of seeing how bad it was still i was shocked at how bad it was it looked more like a film made 50 years ago the acting if any is ultra bad the sets and props are so ridiculously fake making any college film look mega budget and the special effects are laughably simple indeed jaw dropping as others have commented but jaw droppingly embarrassingbr br one has to be severely intoxicated or in an altered state of consciousness in order to appreciate this film if i was from denmark i would be severely embarrassed and humiliated that my countrymen produced such a horrifyingly bad film,0
i saw this film when it was released to the minor cinemas in the uk some 50 years ago and the memory remains of a great musical score and the tragedy of the storyline i saw it again on video recently the sound track was poor and the picture grainy but it is one of two films that i saw again the next day the other being gladiator the music theme is intensely tragic and from the outset one knows that it heralds failure or death certainly one of george sanders best performances as a man working the black market to get pay back for what he lost in the war but nemesis waits patricia roc plays a refugee from eastern europe eaten with despair he is attracted to her selflessly wants to help her and then falls in love with her but she is too proud and hurt to accept help their love destroys him and inevetably the girl and the doctor herbert marshall who brought the nemesis the storyline is of complex intertwining destinies where subsidiary characters are not who they appear to be this is as a film which diappointed the critics and struggled at the box office but for the adolescent who saw it and the retired gentleman who saw it again it is one of the greatest films taking into account its agewhose story is more akin to an opera,1
anne christie was garbos 14th film and the first in which her husky swedish voice was heard she plays the lead character anna who has struggled with being abandoned by her father chris a drunken barge owner played by george f marion and with the misfortune of the life she has has to lead to keep her head above waterbr br meeting irish matt charles bickford may mark the turning point for her or does it garbo looks and sounds great in this drama which although looking rather clunky and moving at a slow pace still manages to interest and engage an audience nearly 80 years later marie dressler makes an impact in the role which gave her a second flush of movie success in films such as min and bill dinner at eight and emma while marion and bickford are more than adequatebr br an interesting slice of movie history garbo would do better talkies in the years following but anna christie will always be remembered for the first time she talked on screen,1
wow br br this film is the best living testament i think of what happened on 91101 in nyc compared to anything shown by the major media outletsbr br those outlets can only show you what happened on the outside this film shows you what happened on the inside br br it begins with a focus on a rookie new york fireman waiting for weeks for the first big fire that he will be called to fight the subject matter turns abruptly with the only existing footage of the first plane to hit the towers you are then given a frontrow seat as firefighters rush to the scene into the lobby of tower one br br in the minutes that precede the crash of the second plane and tower twos subsequent fall you see firemen reacting to the unsettling sound of people landing above the lobby it is a sight you will not soon forgetbr br heartrending tearjerking and very compelling from the first minute to the last 911 deserves to go down in history as one of the best documentary films ever madebr br we must never forgetbr br,1
spoilers ahead but does it really matter have you ever read a movie review composed entirely of questions could this be it why did an ancient civilization bury artifacts all over the world why is this question never answered why was the opening text crawl incoherent why would a nun she sure seemed nice hand over 20 orphans to a madman has there always been a gold mine in downtown vancouver why does one of the gold mines shafts exit in the front yard of an orphanage why does tara reids character suddenly show up at christian slaters apartment for sex or did i just answer my own question why would even a nonarchaeologist bang open an obviously valuable solid gold chest with a sledgehammer why would modern computers still display green pretronera grid outlines of objects complete with little bleeps and must all movie explosive timers have digital displays why doesnt anything in this movie make any sense,0
that maybe someday people will wake up to people who can resist the urge to separate each and everything and who see the 60s for what they were people who can see that it was the individuals who made those times not the other way aroundbr br the forrest gump comparison is a good one both films look at the 60s but four friends is about human beings as opposed to caricatures ff delves deeply into the very thing that fg quite successfully tries to condense and classify as nothing more than a backdrop but while gump files the 60s away in an attic like old toys in a box four friends picks up and embraces each toy thus blurring the lines between what you hold dearly and what you arebr br if you associate romance with shoe polish youll hate this film,1
i really like 101 dalmations when it came out in 1996 now 5 years later i went to see 102 dalmations in 2001 i thought it was fantastic but i think 101 is better because i think its more funnier more humor and also that movie was based on the same story as the cartoon version one hundred and one dalmations 1961 i wonder if there are plans for 103 dalmations i hope there is maybe yes maybe no all of us dalmation fans will have to find out if there is going to be 103 dalmations in the future,1

deliverance is the fascinating haunting and sometimes even disturbing tale by james dickey turned into a brilliant movie by john boorman its about four businessmen driven by manhood and machobehavior whore spending a canoeing weekend high up in the mountains up there theyre faced with every darkest side of man and every worst form of human miserypoverty buggery and even physical harassment these four men intended to travel down the river for adventure and excitement but their trip soon changes into an odyssey through a violent and lurking mountainland completely estranged from all forms of civilisation all these elements actually make deliverance one of the most nightmarish films ive ever seen just about everything that happens to these men you pray that youll never find yourself to be in a similar situation pure talking cinema deliverance is a very important movie as well john boormans best closely followed by zardoz and excalibur was and still is a very influential film and it contains several memorable scenes that already featured in numberless other movies just think about the terrific duelling banjos musical score and of course the unforgettable homosexual squeal like a pig rape scene all the actors deliver haha perfect acting performances especially jon voight a must see motion picture,1
the men in white movie is definitely one of the funniest if not the funniest comedy movies i ever watched and i watched quite a lot it is about two garbagemen who become men in white and then stop an invasion from space it is also a parody of lots of classic movies such as men in black star wars or dr strangelove anyone who says that this movie is crappy has something wrong with his head there are tons of funny gags and jokes here and you might actually get injury to your mouth from laughing too hard it happened to me if you can watch this movie on tv watch it now you certainly wont regret it,1

at initial thought the concept of this show seemed to be a joke and a gag just for stan lees amusement i expected nothing more than a sleazy animated version of barb wire with low production values much like those short pieces of crap you see on adult swim for short term amusement but can never taken too seriously boy was i wrongbr br stripperella has even better production values than similar marvel toons the animation is very good and it seems that theyve taken this series very seriously and given it a full effort to make it a professional production as possiblebr br the humor is good too on the sexy suggestive and sleazy side it is very similar if not exactly like the simpsons style you may encounter clichés and a lot of predictable humor but its still fun nevertheless if this were running today id surely see it regularly its surprisingly one of the better toons ever made,1
although this is generally a cheesy jungleadventure movie it does have some highlights the settings are quite beautiful and the pacing of the adventure is good you wont be bored watching itbr br keith is as breezy as possible playing the eponymous lead an unabashedly drunk jungle guide shanghaid into escorting rich boy van hoffman and his gorgeous wife shower on a hunting expedition in cannibal country he never takes things seriously shower is there as decoration and keith makes extensive use of her she doesnt really have to act much shes not the only female to show off her body and the prurient aspects of the film make it about halfway to a ta picturebr br theres nothing in this film that would draw specific attention to it or away from it produced to be shlock it succeeds without too much fuss a good 2 am cable programmer,0
a couple of weeks after i saw this movie it began to remind me of john carpenters in the mouth of madness not for the story for the atmosphere the fast elements of surprise and the dreamlike sequences on the other hand this movie mixes very well the image and the music note the 4th chapter in the movie,1

out of all the mafia movies i have ever seen this is one of the best for many reasons the acting from pesci cortese and vincent the story is one of the best ever in the mafia genre as it realistic the characters are people that lots of other people can relate to this movie is also great as its dialogue is good it also has very realistic fights and action scenes this movie also launched the careers of pesci and vincent if it werent for the success of this film casino and goodfellas might not have been as good as they were br br story 1010 acting 910 realism 1010br br overall 1010br br my fave mafia movies arebr br 1 goodfellas 2 casino 3 the godfather trilogy 4 family enforcer the death collector 5 the sopranos i know it isnt a movie,1

even though there are no new episodes and it is rarely showed i used to love the magic of sabrina and the teenage witch i never got to see the last episodes but i do want to know what happened to miles or josh and why did the aunts have to disappear out of the show for goodim sure the ending went to be perfect but there are a lot of questions unanswered and i want to see the last episode of sttw because i heard she decides between erin and harvey on her wedding day i really hope that she picks harvey and may i say nate richart is hott too bad hes too old for me though melissa joan hart has her own sense of cuteness that she adds to the show but there are many little stupid things for the show such as how famous bands come out of nowhere and play songs and all the cast is listening its kind of stupid plus the cat starts to really get lame as the show continued the jokes began just to get stupid and the things that the audio controlled audience would laugh at i would think it was so lame dont get me wrong at some parts it was funny but i think the show just kind of lost its magic so to speak as the show went on i give kudos to all the cast though for trying although that soleil moon frye girl had no taste and she was a horrid actress i wonder what melissa or any of the cast is doing now for that matter now that the show has ended,1

alright this movie might have been good if there was a plot behind it the title didnt even fit the it after the first ten minutes the wind didnt have a whole lot to do with the rest of the movie the acting was subpar and the writing reminded me of something you would read in a childrens book of scary stories br br as far as horror movies go this shouldnt even be classified as one this was a disgrace to horror and thriller fans everywhere i hate to be so harsh but i felt i want the time i spent watching this movie back hopefully there will not be a follow up to this this movie should be locked in a vault and never released to the public for viewing,0

recap a lone swordsman living in the desert and acting as an agent to other swordsmen recollects how his life turned out to be as it is it started with that the woman he loved chose to marry his brother instead causing him to leave his home town one of the swordsmen is huang who is himself in the middle of a complicated love story where a woman wants to have him killed for having ran away from a promise to marry her younger sister but the sister wants to hire a swordsman to have huang protected and everything is put to an edge when the woman and her sister is really the same personbr br comments ive seen the redux version released in 2008 of the original that was released in 1994 how the two versions differ i cant say but the redux is very heavily stylized in the way of chinese wuxia action that is unfortunate as that style to me seems to have forgotten one of the most important elements of a successful and entertaining movie a comprehensible story but true to its style scenery and visual elements seem much more important and much more in focus of writer and director kar wai wong therefore there are lots of colorful very beautiful scenes that are completely unrelated to the storybr br the editing and timeline of the story is also mishandled much is left out in the scenes the time line is broken and rearranged in a confusing way very slow and calm scenes are suddenly relieved by surprisingly brutal and seemingly unmotivated fights only to themselves being relieved by something else and unrelated the result is a confusing and very uninteresting moviebr br thanks to these brutal but very few fights the movie is put into the action genre the poster and photographs also imply this but could almost be regarded as false marketing only a few minutes out of the 90 could be considered as anything like action the other couldnt be farther away from it the movie in its entirety is very slow dull and hence very boring not even the rare action filled scenes help since they are so disconnected from the rest of the moviebr br i might say that im not a fan of this chinese style since they often seem to be afflicted of these same problems most importantly that the visual is more important than the story but ashes of time redux is perhaps the worst example ive seenbr br 310,0
well ill begin with this i love horrormovies not even the worst plot or the most insanely terrible acting will ruin the experience as long as there is a certain amount of gore and suspense present second this is the worst movie of all times it even beats mean guns and the attack of the killer tomatoes and for that i pay it homagebr br however the involuntary humor was only funny until half the movie had passed after which point everything was so so sad to my great surprise the reviews where somewhat divided and you guys who rated this piece of cmoviecrap from 7 and up i know youre joking good one hahaha because if there is any reason in the world and we have just an tiny bit of the same notion of what quality is you cant be for realbr br everything worth to be mentioned about the contents has already been summed pretty good up so ill leave it br br minor spoiler alertbr br but the scene where the cloaked rubber mask guy drags the woman back and forth through the dogkennel for ten minutes with o so terrible music score and the mind blowing dialog between the two really does it for me,0
the 1998 version of psycho needed to be set back in the 60s rather than present day the headliners would have done a good job with the setting there were two scenes that just stuck out like a sore thumb the first one was at the beginning of the movie when marian crane anne heche was sitting at her desk her boss took his client into his office because it was air conditioning i imagine that the majority of arizona businesses have air conditioning the other was the meeting of lila crane julianne moore sam loomis viggo mortensen lila sporting the walkman seemed like an exaggeration to update the movie the movie did spook a number of the viewers in the theater,0
ben stiller doesnt so much act as react and he does it very well he is very dependent on the comedy going on around him in theres something about mary the standup hair scene only works because of stiller trying to keep a straight face when he confronts marys other two suitors he is the unfunniest guy in the room but the scene is hilariousbr br in along came polly the formula breaks down for reasons that are difficult to fathom stiller is surrounded by an array of comic talent hank azaria and philip seymour hoffman get the best lines of which there are too few having said that hoffman relies a little too much on bodily humour you know we are in trouble when they go to the fart jokes to raise a laugh a basketball scene where hoffman hams it up is completely overplayed though it throws up one predicament in the form of a shirtless opponent that does raise a smile noticeably through stillers reaction however everyone seems to be acting in a bubble there is very little reaction hoffman and stillers characters could have played off each other much much more aniston again reprises her rachael role but stiller is no ross it is more of a joey with a crush on rachael scenariobr br polly is a bythenumbers romcom and that is its failing it lacks heart you dont root for the characters with a little bit more work we could have had a deeper story but in the end the films failure comes down to poor writing worth watching if it pops up on tv on a slow night but youll regret forking out cash to see it,0
this is an exquisite film about the search for some bliss in everyday life the pacing the camera work the emotion the haunting musical score and the pure charm of this picture make it a must see it isnt easily appreciated by the immature or emotionally stunted the only flaw i can see about this film is that it wasnt captured in a more technically perfect film format it deserved toddao technicolor and the very finest sound format availablean intimate film can be made in seventy millimeter the gorgeous italian villas effect on its inhabitants would have rendered even more lushly and the small lovely moments would be even more beautifully seen and heard as it is it still demands attention as a sweet moving small film i cant stop myself from watching it every time it comes on satelite the transformations of the characters from contained tight and mistrustful is always a joy to watch and i really should recommend it more oftenbr br the casting is perfect the mood is perfect the acting is above reproach it is a film about middle age and the choices people makeit is deep and thoughtful without beating the viewer up with heavy handedness watch it in one sitting and let it have its effect on you if you dont get it perhaps you havent lived enough or something else is wrong with you,1
i stumbled upon this movie on cable and was totally hooked the story of a group of surfers who ride the big waves waves that are monstrously huge waves that would make any rational person run away in terror is a one that manages to be spectacular and make you understand why people spend their lives chasing waves there is nothing special about the film other than it brings together some very interesting people who are are in love with what they do and lets them talk sure there are scenes of them surfing but what makes this movie so special is the people here are a bunch of guys who are so enthusiastic about what they do that it crosses over to the people watching half way into this movie youll want to go off and learn to surf as well few documentaries have ever managed to covey the passion that these people have and its the films ability to make us feel it that makes this a great film see it,1
not often it happens that a great directors last movie becomes such a moving brillantly performed and filmed masterpiece the cast is excellent as well as the camerawork what starts up as a merry comingtogether of a group of welleducated citizens of an early20thcentury dublin turns into a dark philosophic narration about all our fear from death and the sometimes dark shadows of the past thank you mister huston for this last piece of great cinema,1
lets describe larry as an interviewer a complete suckhole in every way possible he laughs at all his guests jokes he asks the most boring questions and he would never dare contradict them he hits me as the type of person who wants to be liked byeveryone friendly boring olpredictable harry he probably owes his success to being a dream interviewer for celebrities because they dont get bombarded with what we the people want to know and have a right to know lets put it this way he interviews as if hes in a red country 0210 2 for the guests that come on the show yet it all seems pointless when larry starts asking his mind numbing questions such as whats it like to be a mother followed by the usual answer along the lines of being a mother is the greatest thing that ever happened to me its wonderful but tiring,0
i thought this movie was going to be a disgrace to the series after all part 3 didnt measure up to part 2 and this one doesnt have daniel sawn miyagis humour wasnt quite as witty in this one as in part 3 but it was funny enough to make the movie worth watchingbr br the girls part was pretty good shes a lost teenager who needs direction i find the plot a little hard to believe that the aunt would simply agree to leave her home and her niece under the care of mr miyagi a man she just met of course he was a friend of her brotherbr br i did appreciate the monastery one might think from some of my other reviews that i wouldnt have liked the dancing monks but i thought it was amusing it showed that they know how to have some fun now if these were monks in ancient china dancing to popmusic that would have been another matterbr br probably the most intelligent part of the movie was when the girl thought it was stupid that the monks wouldnt kill a bug miyagi told her that street gangs killing each other is stupid nations trying to destroy each other is stupid but having respect for all life is not stupid miyagi has expressed such wisdom in the other films as wellbr br i give this movie a 4 out of 10 sure there were some things i liked about it it wasnt as funny as part three and no character could ever live up to sato in part 2 this movie has no rewatch value i cant imagine watching it again but it is worth seeing once,0
the bourne ultimatum jason bourne matt damon in his best role ever the newest spy kid on the block brings his quest for his identity to a close as he also seeks to end the cias latest program blackbriar to make super assassins like himselfbr br i was so psyched for this one that i watched its predecessors yesterday and today identity was as brilliant as i recall and supremacy remains the weak but still enjoyable link in the chain for the weakest plot and aside from a car chase which this films chase easily tops slight lacking in action and suspensebr br hoo boy does ultimatum have suspense even when you know bourne will escape the authorities and boy do these films spotlight the police as inept its still brilliant watching him do it its mindboggling to think that two guys with handguns and mopeds can create 10x more suspense than anything those 150 million giant robots did in transformersbr br chalk it up to paul greengrass who has this idiosyncratic style of shooting stedicam a la documentary even though hes filming characters that are far from ordinary in places like cia headquarters where no one within 10 miles would be allowed with a camcorder he seemed to listen to my various complaints with supremacy as the action in ultimatum is nothing less than aweinspiring with various implements used as weapons being a candlestick a hardcover book ill never look at those the same way again and an electric fan dont ask the music also helped generate much suspense and there was hardly ever a moment to not nailbite overbr br the acting is good and the evolution of julia stiles character nicky put her situation into a new highly sympathetic light damon plays his signature role with reserve but competency which sounds minor but that it genuinely looks like matt damon could evade the cia and interpol is something but noticeable moments of poignancy as he still struggles to find his humanity this longing of his for a real life could get boring and almost did in supremacy but just works better in ultimatum better script br br i am reminded of a scene in goldeneye the only good pierce brosnan bond film in which sean beans character asks james if the martinis ever silence the screams of all the men hes killed bourne regrets all the people he killed and he considers or at least made me consider the meaning of action without purpose life without meaning and how the government has transformed men into resources albeit resources that know krav maga and can make weapons out of anythingbr br sidenote its always bothered me that despite being a superspy and hunted by the cia interpol and the police nearly anywhere he goes that bourne never thought to make even the smallest attempts to disguise his features or forge some new passports sunglasses maybe br br if you have a pulse and love action movies than bourne ultimatum is for you hell its probably the best action film to,1
i really enjoy this particular production of the mikado the producers added a few touches throughout to make it more amusing for modern audiences for instance as some day it may happen the little list song is completely updated and a few lines are adlibbed throughout the play liberties were also taken with the setting the costumes are not japanese but rather 1920s english although some of the tittipudlian girls wear 20sinspired kimonos this production is wellchoreographed with some 1920s dance styles and there are some extra dancing maids and bellhops to keep your eyes as well as ears entertained during the songs if youre a gilbert sullivan purist these changes may bother you but i think theyre fine and i love the costumes br br felicity palmer katisha is absolutely hilarious all of her scenes make me laugh out loud one of my favorite addons is when she first makes an entrance the dancing bellhops annoy her with their antics so she screeches at the top of her voice stop it all of the other main characters do a fine job as well i particularly like mark richardson as pishtush that toupee and lesley garrett as yumyumbr br you must keep in mind that this is a stage production being filmed and set your expectations accordingly there is no change of setting although the filmmakers used some 1930s film techniques to add interest if there is one drawback to this production it is that the stage makeup wasnt modified for closeup shots with a camera foundation lines are often visible and there seems to be a surplus of eyeliner lipstick and blush everywhere ive seen this sort of thing happen before with films of plays and its a little jarring at first however i hope youll get used to it and enjoy the mikado for what its worth a thoroughly enjoyable rendition of a classic,1
it probably isnt fair that i have got to see the majority of all the interesting reviews on the sopranos and then get to add what people have forgotten but oh wellbr br from a standpoint of acting how could any actor fail with these characters each one mesmerizing and intense in their pursuits of life tony sopranowhile a mob capo and suffering from mental illness still sees his life in front of him and knows what has to be done to survive each of his men you see their lives virtually from the inside like the truest form of voyerism it definitely brings out a sort nosey side in each and every viewer and i include myself in thisbr br while some above dont care for bracco i have to say this is the freshest role she has had in years since good fellas she is the side of tony that makes him listen to reason that makes him decent that offers him respite when dealing with his human emotions that he has failed to feel for so long if ever she is simply put his savior not speaking in religious tonesbr br but the knockout performance here is without doubt edie falco to see her prison guard role in the other acclaimed hbo series oz and then see her as livia is the ultimate compliment for any actor or actress she has transcended the boundries of a recognizable actress something only actresses like merle streep can get away with a sort of chameleon quality to transcend roles but as i have mentioned before with a characters a strong as these how can any actor failbr br livias strength is in her daily affirmation of faith in herself she is a survivor as she hopes her husband and family will be survivors she is prepared for the worst because she knows the hazards of her husbands business yet knows the lifestyle she has is more then most women from jersey she is wise if not wiser and more street savvy then tony himselfbr br all in all the biggest crime from the soprano family is that we the viewer have to wait until january 2000 to see the next season this in my opinion is the worst thing about the hbo series it was what brought the larry sanders show sex and the city dream on and others back down to earth in popularity and eventually killed them too much space in between seasons and very sporadic until then i will watch the reruns with the hope that this gap in programming is filled,1
i have been away from istanbul for the last 10 years during that time i constantly lived in london when i have seen the movie i realised how much i am istanbuler i am not just from turkey i am a part of turkey one of my part is istanbul the sound of the istanbul the people of the istanbulbr br probably faith akin thought that he has done great musical documentary but i must say it is more than that it is about putting nice blend of vastly different musics cultures approaches politics ethnics into a delicious potbr br as we all know turkey to be precise istanbul is always comes and goes between being eastern or western city as one of the band member said istanbul is a bicultural city but much more a eastern city because we always tried to be a western city it shows weve never been onebr br this movie will catch from very first second music is excellent people are fascinating especially aynur and sezen aksu singers band members it is nice to see you all at a small cinema in wood green,1
with the death of george nader on 4 february 2002 i thought of this most interesting program which even though it had only a short run was a tremendous idea with good story lines throughout generally unseen for over 40 years it would be worth viewing again the opening credits showed many differing images one of which was a snippit of colonel john paul stapp riding his famed rocket sled at the point where he was often referred to as the fastest man alive,1
this movie appears to have been an on the job training exercise for the coppola family it doesnt seem to know whether to be an a or a b western i mean the hero is called hopalong cassidy for gods sake william boyd must be spinning in his gravebr br all the b western cliches are here the twogun pearly toothed hero in the white hat with the trusty steed cmon thunder the allinblack bearded villain the heroine in distress the rancher in trouble the cowardly sheriff over the top bad guys etcbr br the acting with few exceptions is strictly from the yakima canutt school of acting chris lybbert who as the hero and louis schweibert who as the villain look like they would have been more at home in a 30s poverty row quickie the addition to the cast of veteran performers martin sheen robert carradine clu gulager and will hutchins helps a little but they are not given enough to do to salvage this onebr br what was the point of the martin sheenrobert carradine framing sequences are we to believe that the sheen character was a ghost what was the purpose of the black gloves it just didnt make sensebr br being a great lover of westerns from all genres i tried hard to find some redeeming qualities in this film the cinematography was quite good and the settings looked very authentic aside from the hero and main villain the other characters looked authenticbr br if the producers were going to resurrect the hopalong cassidy character they might have given some thought to portraying him as he was originally written a grizzled foulmouthed ranch hand with a chip on his shoulder the kind of part lee marvin would have excelled inbr br what else can i say buton thunder on big fellow,0
the mountainous woods young happy campers a warning by a park ranger and a lurking figure the ingredients are there for a horror delight and directorcowriter jeff lieberman does an adequate job at achieving it its formulaic woodland horror but for most part the execution is at the top the game and the story which is quite basic in a trimmed sense is effectively told in certain realism maybe a little more exposition wouldnt have gone astray but liebermans craftsmanship makes up for the materials flaws and typical details with rising tension moody visuals and a smothering atmosphere created by brad fiedels very ominously lingering score whenever that very creepy whistling was cued in it painted a truly unnerving sense that settled in with the beautiful backdrop cinematographers dean m and joel king do a striking job too theres plenty of style abound even with its minimal scope and the buildup is slow grinding at times the pacing can become a stopandgo affair its not particularly violent but theres still a meanstreak evident even if some of it happens of screen the latter chase scenes and escalating fear is well done as it has the darkness coming alive with its burly killers and you get actor george kennedy riding his white horse in a slight but wonderful turn theres a likable bunch of performances deborah benson makes for a strong dashing heroine gregg henry chris lemmon ralph seymour jamie rose mike kellin and katie powell round off a modest cast of believable deliveries the final climax is rather twisted but the ending is one of those types that leave you thinking is that it br br a welletched backwoods slasher item which probably plays it a little too safe to truly set it apart from the norm,1
i gave this 9 stars out of a possible 10 if it had had just a teensy weensy bit more plot line i would have given it 10br br nonetheless it is a highly interesting filmbr br judith ivey playing a likable old floozy should have been given the oscar for her performancebr br emily grace portraying alice whom i had never seen before also does an excellent job and has the sexiest body i think ive ever seen on filmbr br in a beat to heck old car alice has lit out from the ne for florida where she has a friend or maybe its her sister im not sure and thats my fault not the films and high hopes of going to college which she and her family cant really affordbr br she seems rather vulnerable out there on the road alone and sure enough she encounters some slightly rough looking characters and shortly after that its discovered theres a hole in one of her tiresbr br she is at a rest stop at the time and is assisted by a woman named sandra and her husband bill an older couple who are traveling in an rvbr br theyre going south to florida and take her under their wing but is everyone quite the way theyre presenting themselves flashbacks and paranoia enter the story as our young heroine learns some new lessons about life,1
this movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war everything about the movie was perfect i just saw the movie yesterday and i want to get my own dvd asap and watch it many times over the story ends as it started i was very happy that he came back and i was proud of her for becoming a doctor and fulfilling her fathers dream she honored her father boyfriendhusband and her lover the character had many shades christian bale is also an phenomenal actor some stories do have happy endings aside from the love story angle i thought about how a beautiful serene and peaceful island had been affected by war and it made me realize the true devastation war can have on its peoplegovernment makes the decision whereas the people suffer her father was a very educated man and wanted more for his daughter while she had regular dreams i loved the scene where she is complaining about not getting a dowry and i also loved the scene where both lived through the earthquake they were survivors,1
chaplin was great a silent comedian but many silent era stars fell when the public heard their voices in the first talkies in my opinion chaplins voice simply did not fit his silent characters that made him rich and famous his career never recovered when sound came to film contrary to most of the reviews i have read chaplins lifestyle and politics did not help his popularity with the average viewer who expected to be entertained by chaplin the comedian and not spend their entertainment dollar watching chaplins political commentarybr br despite chaplins awards and knighthood i would take exception to his contributions to humanity the great dictator was made at the same time stalins brutal dictatorship was having its show trials and both dictators signed the agreement that lead to invasion of poland by both dictators wwii started in an attempt to save poland the nazis were defeated in 6 years but poland disappeared as a sovereign country this happened during the time this film was made and the investigations of hollywood by the federal government had chaplin included joe stalin in this satirein addition to including the italian dictator perhaps he would have had less criticism about his politics by the politicians the soviets mistreatment of jews and dissidents exceeded the nazis in time and numbersbr br judged simply as a film many of the gags were too topical to be understood by younger viewers who wouldnt know who goebbels goring or mussolini were a classic piece of art must stand the test of time classic greek tragedy the mona lisa and beethovens 9th are still enjoyed centuries after their creation because they are timeless films which rely on topical political commentary or currently popular social views usually do not outlast the generation in which they are made but those that address issues that are common to all generations will probably live forever and receive a high rating from mebr br chaplin as the writer director and lead actor must take the blame for what i judge as a dated and tiresome filmbr br chaplins apologists have excused his decision to leave the country that made him rich and famous if chaplin found the us so offensive why didnt he return to his native land great britian fought the naziwith blood and money what did switzerland contribute in the fight against the european dictators switzerland is like a country club that picks and chooses its members based on race and class and cares little about people who cant join the club,0
as someone who has both read the novel and seen the film i have a different take on why the film was such a flop first any comparisons between novel and film are purely superficial they are two different animalsbr br the novel is probably intended as a satire but it arrives as a cross between tragedy and polemic instead any comedic elements such as those which later formed the stylistic basis of the film version are merely incidental to the authors uniformly cynical thrust and lest the omnipresent white suit of the author fool you into thinking this is another mark twain think again a more apt literary precedent would be the spectre of ambrose bierce in a top hat and tails tom wolfe is equal parts clown and hack more celebrity than author always looking for new grist for his selfabsorbed mill br br it is therefore no wonder that the excellent production skills and direction lavished on the making of the film were doomed from the start unlike true satire which translates very well into film polemics are grounded not in universally accessible observations on some form or other of human behavior but in a singleminded attack on specific people whether real or fictional straw men who have somehow earned the wrath of the writer any effort to create a successful filmed story or narrative from such a beginning must have a clean start free of the writers influence or interferencebr br having said that i too find fault with the casting it is not merely that incompetents like bruce willis and melanie griffith fail to measure up but that real talents like tom hanks f murray abraham and morgan freeman are either totally wasted or given roles that are mere caricaturesbr br there is enough topical material here for a truly great film satire but it fails to come even close,0
anytime im not giving 150 to my dreams or my goals i think of mark borchardt the reallife subject of american movie marks dogged persistence at having his first feature film produced and shot is so captivating that it will have you laughing shaking your head with sadness and rooting for himbr br i havent seen a documentary this honest since the movie on r crumb the supporting cast marks reallife family and friends are all great give this movie a chance and youll see a great film and a wonderful portrait of the stuff that the american dream is made of,1
stephen king tv movies can go 5 or 6 parts and no one complains right so why give the stooges only 96 minutes im not asking for a pbs miniseries but would a two parter had killed anyone the movie steamrolled over events that should have been mentioned and mentioned events that could have been omitted i do want to give a salute to the performances of the starsthey had a tough job because they didnt really look like the stooges but the spirit was there after watching the movie i pulled out a tape from american movie classics that had the real deal on it and laughed myself silly the movie was pretty tough emotionally especially after curly has the stroke and moe needs to keep the business going when curley started crying i lost itlike i said the movie was good but could have been and should have been much much better maybe its fitting thoughthe stooges got ripped off when they were alive and now 25 years later it happens again,0
this movie twists the facts of anne and marys lives into something unrecognizable to make mary boleyn who in fact was a rather dim and foolish creature and make her the good sister is just silly it is anne who was in fact the far more interesting character and that is why it is her life and not marys that has been told so oftenbr br in response to an earlier review i fail to see how annes life was so criminal to me its henry who was the real criminal whatever annes motives for winning the king and withholding her affections in order to gain a crown and husband has to be taken into context of the time in which these reallife events took place anne in comparison to the majority of most of the courtiers in her time was a relatively innocent figure most modern historians discount or have disproven most of the myths and slanders that this movie perpetuate about her and i have never heard of anyone who actually believes the rumour than she slept with her brother this movie is so sensational and false that it is maddening to think that someone without knowing anything about this period in history could walk away believing anything this movie has presented as factbr br i wont even get into the weird filming of the movie but im pretty sure that cameras werent invented in the 16th century so i dont understand why anne and mary are talking to one throughout the movie its a really bad plot devise and is jarring and annoying to put it mildlybr br anne of the thousand days is not accurate either but is infinitely more entertaining and at least comes closer to telling the story of one of the most intriguing women of history dont even think about renting this its two hours youll never get back,0
this is one of those movies where i wish i had just stayed in the barbr br the film is quite frankly boring what story there is is very flimsy and you pretty much have to guess at it the film indulges itself with pretentious camera techniques that seem intent on causing migraines and makes it look like a student film did i say it was boring already if all the characters had suddenly died at the end of the movie i would not have cared less as i had no emotional attachment to any of thembr br there are about 4 good minutes in this movie but that was about it this is the first time i have ever considered walking out of a cinema during a performance but i held on believing that it had to get better i was wrongbr br the sort of film you could threaten naughty children with,0
normally i dont bother wasting my time writing comments for junk like this that i forget almost as soon as i see it but since i saw this movie just yesterday on one of the comcast showtime channels 346 i think i decided to make an exceptionbr br besides the fact that i enjoyed watching carol alt i cant give any rational reason why i watched this movie through to the end im always amazed that goodlooking women are willing to appear in awful movies like this but i suppose she thought this movie would lead to something better i hope she was right for her sakebr br otherwise this is an alltootypical straighttovideo laugh riot or just a piece of garbage depending on your point of view while there are a few decent moments of action in this movie they dont really connect well with the story such as it isbr br the setup as i recall involved carol alt as a depressed housewife who believes her husband a cop is cheating on her there was also something about their child dying in an accident and she blaming him for it but before that storyline went anywhere she shot and killed himbr br on the same fateful night a wounded stranger comes to her door and she tends to him and almost immediately her house is under siege by government stooges and mercenaries intent on capturing the stranger who appears to have almost superhuman fighting skillsbr br this same kind of material has yielded decent entertainment plenty of times before most notably in matt damons the bourne identity and could have done so this time as well but this particular movie was let down by poor production values and a lousy scriptbr br this movie really falls apart at the end when the mysterious stranger turns out to be a cyborg who was programmed to be a policeman and after discovering that carol alt killed her husband he tries to kill her the movie wasnt particularly good up until this point but the ending really ruins it by trying to turn a modest actionthriller into a lumpy terminatorrobocop wannabebr br i also thought that the violence in the movie was a bit excessive at the end with the demented cyborg gouging out poor carol alts eye before it finally bit the dust what was the point of that for that matter what was the point of anything in this movie it held my attention and entertained me for about an hour until the end when it reminded me that i wasnt watching a firstrate movie it wasnt even really a secondrate movie for that matterbr br the final scenes seem to hint at a sequel which i dont think ever happened although i havent carefully checked the web for it needless to say that im not in any hurry to see any sequel to this movie,0
this cheap and rubbish film is about a nasa test rocket that is sent into space with a cargo of animals it vanishes for a while then unexpectedly returns crash landing in a forest unleashing a vicious mutant creaturebr br like many films of this type night fright features dumb teenagers boogieing on down to 60s surf music before being killed none of the murders however are even remotely memorable as we dont really see anything one thing we do see however is that one of the teenagers appears to be about 40 years old and sports a quite impressively silly haircutbr br for a creature feature to work it really has to present its monster to the viewer properly in this film however we only get the briefest glimpses of the monster it seems to sort of resemble the alien from robot monster but im not sure as the photography was so dark i simply couldnt make out what the hell was going on a lot of the time although my gut feeling was that i probably wasnt missing very much,0
any movie that shows federal pigs persons in government to be the powermad threats they are in real life has a lot to recommend it to mebr br alas the script supervision and editing and even at times the directing are flawed so there will be people who will disparage the whole movie and ignore the good momentsbr br i saw the original way back when it was new and hated it despised it loathed it thought it was a terrible irrational piece of junkbr br now though i dont remember whybr br i believe the two should not be compared or even connectedbr br consider them as two different moviesbr br rate them as two different moviesbr br this vanishing point provides a rallying place a banner for people who want to encourage individualism who believe in human rights who recognize the threat to freedom government can be and is especially the federal governmentbr br the voice wears a cap bearing the state motto of new hampshire live free or die at one time it would have been the motto of most americansbr br despite its obvious flaws vanishing point is a film to cheer,1
i like this movie cause it has a good approach of buddhism for example the way buddhist use to care all kind of living things combining some fancy and real situations in some parts the photography is very good and a lot of messages about freedom as the hawk episode staying always focused in every moment even in tough situations it has also funny situations as swanks birthday and talking this two times academy awards her acting show us how the people who use to live in this kind of culture is trying to have a resistance behavior when miyagi is taking her to a buddhist temple and how she slowly is changing her mind and of course pat morita has been always great,1
im a huge fan of the dukes of hazzard tv show and i really enjoyed this flick i enjoyed myself here a lot more than i did with other summer blockbustersbr br its funny hearing people rail against this movie with excuses like lame plot and its much cruder than the show does anyone remember the crudeness of the humor in the pilot episode daisy makes incest jokes and bo says that luke had probably fathered half the kids in the orphanage the only reason it was cleaned up is because it changed to and earlier time slotbr br and as far as the plot goes it was the perfect dukes plot in fact as a remake it probably stays truer to the source material than any tv show that has migrated to the big screenbr br while sean william scott and johnny knoxville arent exactly like their small screen versions they do a great job and work very well together i wasnt too keen on burts boss hogg though and i would have like a little bit more incompetence from sheriff roscoe in the movie roscoe is a little scarybr br and who didnt have a smile on their face as the general lee is racing through the streets of atlanta and the back roads of hazzardbr br folks allow yourself to enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia bikinis and car chases you wont be sorry its just a great dumb movie,1
this had the promise of being an interesting film the subject matter was certainly a promising one the excesses of the catholic church during the counterreformation however not only was this not developed other than a two paragraph introduction many things were not explained ie the gypsies the anabaptists the inquisitors and their relationship to the one true church nor were the politics of the time explained ie the relationship between the catholic church and its supporters like the holy roman emperor though these may have been apparent to an austrian audience the lack of explanation makes it confusing for americansbr br but perhaps its a good thing that they didnt emphasize the history since what they showed was pretty inaccurate anyway instruments of torture bloody executions witch and heretic burnings big shiny swords and pretty golden reliquaries are the stars of the film it could have just as easily been one of those conantype sword and sorcery movies only with period costumes,0
every time i watch this show i just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time week after week the dialogs or monologues rather as everybody just rants on endlessly about nothing are just becoming so tedious for example the episode i watched yesterday began with a seemingly unending rambling about how a particular dish i forgot what it was pasta with meatballs perhaps always manages to turn the gilmore family dinner into allout war and these were just the few seconds or sobr br so it seems every time lots of lines with absolutely zero content the scripts they use must be enormousbr br but then every once in a while something happens the babbling stops and suddenly there are these wonderful silent emotional moments for example this week it was lorelais breakdown at the estate agents i just thought it was the best piece of tv i have seen for a long whilebr br almost makes everything worthwhile,1
son of the mask is a terrible movie i dont like the baby and i dont like the dog jamie kennedy and his wife are a cute couple but that cant redeem sitting through this garbage even at only 88 minutes or so it says the movie could not end soon enough for me the only real laughs come at the beginning with a brief appearance by ben stain thats it the rest is just a rehash of the first movie actually that is just an insult to rehashes why was this sequel made this movie cost millions of dollars to make why would i sit through a movie with a baby and a dog intentionally trying to drive the dad crazy jamie kennedy is talented but he has nothing to do in this movie i am not bothering to be nice to this movie 110,0
having some idle time before going to work i looked at my 50 movie pack comedy classics dvd collection and picked the most obscure title in the pack zis boom bah starring a forgotten grace hayes classics is obviously the operative word here since most of the titles ive never heard of and i suspect theyre all in the public domain anyway this movie also stars her son peter lind and his wife mary healy who i just found out is a new orleans native from the state i live in louisiana with benny rubin as a malt shop proprietor and huntz hall taking a break from the east side kids as peters buddy the plot about a vaudeville mother trying to turn her rich carefree son into a responsible one with him unaware of who she is is for the birds and doesnt have many funny scenes though i did like peters celebrity impersonations and his dance with hall in drag and the songs and dances are entertaining in themselves rubin however is all over the place with his confusion of the american vernacular of the time and almost everything concerning him makes no sense whatsoever though i did like his funny dance since this was only 61 minutes that im sure played on the lowerhalf of the double feature bill ill be charitable and give this one a 3 for the few entertaining bits that i mentioned enjoying,0
that movie was awesome i cant get over its songs i think im a little too old for musicals but that movie deserves some credit here guys my especial favorite was jack wild me being a british actor lover you cant restrain me from all those nicelooking fresh faced young men i never knew that when jack was doing that movie he was sixteen he looks like an eleven year old hes short thats what helps try posting up your replies fellow posters so i can relate to your experiences oh and about oliver reed that guy bill sikes i think that drone look is really familiar any idea where hes starred in before if so post it up id really like to know,1
i watched cheats a few years ago with my friend he hyped it up as a great funny film that is one of the best comedies ever i think he was on crack or something i just recently learned that this film was not released into theatres i can understand why perfectlybr br the basic plot involves a group of guys who cheat on pretty much all of their assignments in school to get good grades that is the main problem of this film is that the morals are all bad there are other teen comedy films where students do bad things but it is most often stuff that does not take place at school so i think that the concept of having a whole movie that basically has kids cheating on everything is pretty badbr br i did not like the characters in this film either the main character guy is a completely smug arrogant idiot who is not a good protagonist actually i am not sure if you could say that there is a protagonist due to the fact that they all are cheating at school which is wrong the other supporting characters were not funny at all and basically the cast blows in this filmbr br this film has a bad message and even worse acting and characters there are other teen films that are way better than this film so you do not have to see this one and that is a good thing because i do not recommend this film at all,0

doityourself indie horror auteur todd sheets returns with another entertainingly atrocious nickelndime shotonvideo clunker thats basically just a feeble excuse to sling around a lot of watery blood and gleaming guts as often as possible an evil demonic scarecrow resurrects the dead as ravenous rotfaced zombies so they can feast on the living a bunch of bickering college kids a trio of dangerous escaped convicts led by the vicious slade byron nichodemus hamming it up to an outrageous degree two equally savage sleazeball hoodlums and a trio of hottie sisters all have to do their best to survive this harrowing ordeal thats it for the needlessly muddled and convoluted plot but fortunately what this hilariously horrendous hoot lacks in narrative coherence plenty it more than compensates for with a pleasing plethora of gloriously grossngraphic gore disgusting highlights include a woman having her fingers chopped off a fatal gunshot to a young gals groin attempted necrophiliac rape evisceration and of course more repulsive entrail eating than you can shake a pile of moist intestines at moreover weve also got rough grainy cinematography that constantly alternates between washedout color and grimy black and white ineptly staged fight scenes lousy acting from a uniformly pathetic noname cast jerry angell in particular cops the top crummy thespic dishonors for his laughably abysmal histrionics as slimy nocount psycho criminal joe bob a grating headbanging thrash metal soundtrack and a generic shiverynominous synthesizer score lets not forget the ridiculous ending in which several of our survivors stumble across a few vials of flesheating bacteria to use on the shambling undead hordes sure this flick is pure dreck but it has a certain endearingly abominable quality to it that in turn makes it a great deal of soawfulitsawesome grade z fun for hardcore aficionados of bad fright fare,1
the 60s is an occasionally entertaining film most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film it is extremely uneven and includes many annoying elements take for instance the switch between black white and color if done right this could of been fairly effective but because it was done poorly it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience much of the film had an odd feel to it the acting wasnt extremely bad for a made for tv flick but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times many of the events were not coherent and ending up being confusing how did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the 1960s the ending was much too sappy for my tastes because it was hollywoodized everything had to turn out right in the end i would advise you to not waste your time on the 60s and do something else with your time im glad i watched this in class and not on my own time i think i can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of bob dylans music those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick i hope you take my advice and stay away from this,0
i knew full well when i rented this dvd that it could very well be one of the worst movies ive seen in my life but to say that it was one of the worst movies ive ever viewed would be putting it lightly im wondering if there isnt some legal action that can be taken against the individuals that allowed this film to produced i mean the financing had to come from somewhere someone had to put up money for this to be producedbr br id pinpoint several production values that led to the failure of this film but this film violated every production standard in the universe i couldnt make it thru the entire movie as i started getting dizzy the from horrendous filming techniques i also cant tell you how many scenes i just ended zoning off during because of the inexplicably horrific dialogbr br i feel like ive been permanently scarred for life if you viewed this movie before getting this warning you should think about starting a support group with me for the poor people who did view this monstrosity,0
prior to this film i had only seen two films by director andrea bianchi the trashy zombie flick le notti del terrore 1981 famous amongst horror fans for its unforgettable performance from manchild peter bark and the enjoyably sleazy giallo strip nude for your killer neither film was a particularly spectacular piece of cinema but both were entertaining in their own special way and the fact that they featured plenty of gore and nudity didnt hurt massacre however is dull dull dull despite quite a bit of splatter and the odd spot of gratuitous bare fleshbr br the story about a series of murders in a hotel where the cast and crew of a horror film are residing during their shoot is confusing and ohso boring when the blood isnt flowing and the skin isnt on show the film is a real struggle to sit through it took me four attempts to finish with endless scenes of unlikeable characters bickering among themselves and doing very little of notebr br the only point of interest about the film is that its producer lucio fulci used several of its death scenes to pad out his megagory movie cat in the brain aka nightmare concert and if youve already seen that film then there is very little reason to bother with massacre,0
sweeney todd is in my opinion one of a few perfect musicals like my fair lady and west side story it has a wonderful intelligent score it offers the two leads and several supporting characters interesting roles it has a timeless theme revenge it has a good deal of humor and is just as powerful when presented simply or on a grand scalebr br sweeney todd tells the story of a simply wronged man during the industrial period in england it shows mans inhumanity to man how in sweeneys own words there are two kinds of men theres the one staying put in his proper place and the one with his foot in the other ones face in an effort to correct the wrong that was done to him mr todd devices a plan to seek revenge with the help of mrs lovett who owns a meat pie shop under mrtodds barbershop they set out to have those above serve those down belowbr br i was fortunate enough to have seen the original broadway version eight times six with cariou and lansbury the other two with hearn and loudon i saw the revival with bob gunton and beth fowler and several other concert versionsbr br while the technical aspects in this production are lacking to say the least i believe that this filmed production version is the best lansbury and hearn were the two best in these roles and they have a wonderful time playing off of each otherbr br very good supporting work by ken jennings and edmund lyndeck although betsy joslyn and cris groenendaal as the young lovers have absolutely no chemistry and are basically unwatchablebr br 9 out of 10,1
i reached the end of this and i was almost shouting no no no no it cannot end here there are too many unanswered questions the engagement of the dishwashers monas disappearance helmers comeuppance the zombie was little brother saved by his father and what about the head argh then i read that at least two of the cast members had passed on and i have to say i know it probably wouldnt be true to lars von triers vision but i would gladly look past replacement actors just to see the ending he had planned granted it would be hard to find someone to play helmer as the character deserves helmer the doctor you love to hate i think i have yet to see a more selfabsorbed oblivious selfrighteous character on screen but i could overlook a change in actorsi just have to know how it ends,1
first off let me say that this movie is nothing spectacular the cast is like the saved by the bell reunion the monster is a guy in a bad outfit and like always the military is useless it would seem that the more training you have and the bigger your gun the more likely it is that you will die if youre in a cheesy low budget horror movie apparently the people in the movie business have little respect for the navy seals the marines and ninjas who get it the worst the plot is thin a nutcase cryptozoologist by the name of dr peña traps the chupacabra he then smuggles it aboard a cruise ship where two members of the crew let it loose you can do your taxes and watch this movie and not miss a beat the most noteworthy part that really makes it all worthwhile revolves around the captains daughter toward the end she goes all martial arts on the monster and kicks his butt let me get this straight the monster wipes out the entire navy seals unit while they are using armor piercing ammunition ok its a movie it can happen right but here comes the captains daughter who cant be older than 19 and kicks the crap out of the chupacabra with front and side kicks it was hilarious they should get a medal for coming up with that,0
im not american but meatballs still really hits me maybe because its a sweet sweet movie watching it again today made me sentimental for a time i cant really put my finger on and a place i cant quite rememberbr br meatballs is just a great movie it reminds me of innocent days when nothing really mattered and anything was possiblebr br if youre reading this you probably know what i meanbr br all i can say on top of what ive already said is that meatballs must be even more nostalgic if youre americanbr br i guess you know what i mean by that too,1
br br spoilersbr br im going to be as kind as i can about this film some people including directors can get quite upset when reviewers speak their mind sobr br there is a nice car accident and the opening credits look good and thats it everything else bites the big one all the acting is appalling the script is embarrassing the special effects look like they were done by school children on cheap computers all in all this film has serious bowling shoe tendenciesbr br as a horror film its not very scary and if it supposed to a thinking mans horror film well it succeeded on some level i kept thinking that the end of this film is an awfully long way away it may actually be an ironic look at bad horror films and im missing the point but i somehow doubt itbr br this is a complete car phone warehouse of a film and i could not recommend it to anyone and it does pain me to say this as i eagerly await the resurrection of british horrorbr br if you dont agree with this review that fine its just my own opinion and im sure someone out there will love it the directors mum for instance,0
i have read almost all the books by now and have seen the musical production in two different languages i absolutely adored everything that i have been acquainted previously but lately ive been running out of resources to sustain my fancy i still have couple of books left but they are either in transit or they are the sequels which i am not in a hurry to read so an idea dawned on me sink me there are movies which i have not watched thus i must watch them immediatelybr br the first five minutes of these series were acceptable in fact i quite enjoyed the variation of the reason for the denunciation however different it had seemed it went all downhill from there though chauvelin was too foppish and i daresay too old for this role not nearly that dark and dashing figure with his dreadful eitheror and what was that with random bed scene featuring him it was way too creepy wasnt his only love the madame guillotine and his only interest his job and his only obsession sir percy marguerite prettiest woman in france cleverest woman in europe i think not although whatever compelled her to break into the study of sir percy i havent the faintest idea and whatever my lord tony has done to deserve this death yes every member of the league did pledge his life to sir percy but he would have never endangered any of them nor would have run away like a coward when his dear friend faces mortal danger and if by any means he had to mourn his companion he would have done that mourn not just move on as if nothing had happened which brings me to another point sir percy his portrayal was most dreadful he was neither a lazy fop nor a gallant and elusive hero who is a master of transformations nor did he care too much about cravats his pronunciation of that word alone made my ears bleed and with his own hands he had never killed anyone so what was that with him randomly walking around and slaughtering peoplebr br the costumes were just too flashy for that time period as well this is postrevolutionary france we are talking about not prerevolutionary people in dresses like that stand out in a crowd quite easily it was all just gahbr br although i must admit after i watched other parts my opinion did change slightly watching it as a separate work independent of scarlet pimpernel series it was tolerable just your other average hero in the mask but for what they tried to pass it it is still miserable,0
any film in the early days of orson welles is a triumph all the way to the third man with joseph cotton he is also wonderful in a touch of evil please see them all he tends to get pompous and self serving in films like f is for fake really stupid waste of filmdont waste your time watching it it is really ignorant orson welles is a film icon and anyone studying film should see everything he has filmed all his leading ladies are tremendous but in the end welles became a fat drunk like his character in a touch of evil for some reason orson welles had a way with women i see how he could be considered attractive in his youth not like gary cooper or joseph cotton or cary grantjohn wayne i could go on and on but i digress and because i am a womani can see the attraction to him he orson welles is one of the last true film makers and unless you count the filmmakers of today tarantino scorscese spike lee most of the film makers just dont measure up to the film makers of the forties i know there are many more great film makers of today but in such a short amount of time i cant name them all no offense to any of the great film makers of this millennium august 212006 please remind me of some current up and coming film makers i dont want to be stuck in the past i love some of the films out now but rarely are there any that i would put on a 100 best list hustle and flow was great so was fargo and oh brother where art thou from a line in sullivans travels another fine film from the forties can anyone give me a best list for the 90s and on up to 2006 i would like to know who to watch thank you also props to this website where else can you plug a film or boo it i love the ranting and raving from regular folks like me who can say what i want and i promise not to spoil any film for someone who hasnt seen it yet,1
ok maybe a 13 year old like me was a little to old for this movie its about this pampered rat who lives in a palace then a sewer rat flushes him down a toilet he ends up in this rat city and meets this girl rat who has a gem a greedy frog wants he will do anything for this gem he sends a whole army after these two ratshe plans to take the gem and to flood rat city the cool part about this movie is the slugs they do all the sound effects they sing make noises its awesome its also pretty funny ok bottom line it is aimed at 7 year olds other wise a great movie to take a younger family member to see i didnt think the animation was real dreamworks art though more like wallace and gromit i thinkthey slacked a little on that the movie was just decent not worth spending 950 for though sorry,0

i saw bandit queen in 2005 over a decade after it was made amidst widespread controversy in india the language the stark treatment and the natural acting by a relatively unknown cast for that time might have been even more shocking at that time for an indian populace more familiar with fantasy cinema the film the cast and shekhar kapoor deserve accolades for the breakthrough effortbr br the plot is not very different from a typical revenge drama made in various forms in india in fact there have been several fictional accounts of this particular story itself the reason why this stands out is that its supposed to be a first person account of someone who actually went through all this and a lot else that doesnt find place on the screen and survived to tell the tale survived long enough to see her story made into a movie at least phoolan devi didnt live very long after being released from prison in 1994br br the film scores on several counts the cinematography is brilliant the music is apt the cast many of whom became more familiar names later is very good but the screenplay is patchy things move too fast and in jerks at times its understandable though because there are just too many strands that need to be tied together to make it all cohesive or maybe i felt that because i have read mala sens book which is a more detailed and better though obviously not as shocking as the visual account of phoolan devis travails and which is purported to be one of the main sources for the filmbr br there are some factual ambiguities too according to phoolan devi she wasnt present when the behmai massacre took place and despite claiming to be the dictated account of phoolan herself she is shown to participate and in fact initiate the massacre then the final scene where phoolan surrenders shows her touching the feet of the chief minister while in reality she had surrendered to a portrait of mahatma gandhi symbolic value only but shows that phoolan didnt want to show servitude to a living ordinary person it would have been nice to show the chief minister to have some resemblance to arjun singh who many remember was the cm of madhya pradesh thenbr br but these are small chinks in this eminently wellmade movie a rare gem to come out from the mainstream indian film industry made by a man who before this was known best for the ultimate masala movie of the late 80s mr india,1

one would think that anyone embarking upon a followup to the groundbreaking naked civil servant of 30plus years ago would at the very least try to honor the original with some kind of inspired vision but no here we have a sort of biopic of one of the most stylish people of the late 20th century that itself boasts no style whatsoever true the filmmakers have assembled some outstanding actors and handed them a chipped mug of drab gruel to work with everything in the infrastructure of this film is wrong starting with the script which is another one of those tvmovie condensations of great lives wherein every other line is a famous quote by the subject and every other scene is an inyourface introduction to the next pivotal character in the subjects life we get swoozie kurtz as a pr maven who promotes crisp as a stateside entertainer denis ohare as the editor of a gay periodical who hires crisp as film reviewer becomes somewhat alienated from him when he appears indifferent to the passions of 80s aids activists and then returns to the fold as a compassionate friend of the dying octogenarian jonathan tucker in a fine performance as a shy insecure painter of gaythemed canvases who is befriended by crisp and finally cynthia nixon as performance artist and womanaboutbohemia penny arcade who intrigued by crisps persona offers him a spot in her traveling cabaret act nixon is a persuasive and gifted performer but is given no chance by the script to embody the downtoearth and streetwise arcade crisp spent the last 20 years of his life in a oneroom flat in an old tenement building in manhattans east village he famously said that he never cleaned because after a few years the dust doesnt get any worse or something like that but looking at the depiction of that flat in this film youd never get the flavor of that dustiness he frequented a local coffee shop on a busy avenue and would be seen pretty much each day of the week sipping tea and watching the world go by in this film we get a diner that looks like something on 12th avenue by the hudson river most of the streets of new york scenes have a sterile unreal look with no sense of the period br br the soul of this film is the great john hurt in the title role after nearly 35 years he can still grasp the essence of this peculiar postedwardian englishman and put it across to third millennarians his every line every gesture is exquisite in the later scenes he even modulates his vocal projection to suit that of a person whose life is winding down toward death crisp wrote shortly before he left this realm that when one grows very very old ones skin takes on the character of a smelly overcoat that cannot be removed and one longs for death one senses that feeling in hurts performance so for him and him alone this film is worth a look,0
after finally watching walt disneys song of the south on myspace i decided to watch ralph bakshis response to that moviecoonskinon afro video which i linked from google video in this one during the liveaction sequences preacherman charles gordone takes his friend sampson barry white with him to pick up pappy scatman crothers and randy philip thomas years before he added michael for his middle name professionally as the latter two escape from prison during their attempt pappy tells randy a tale of brother rabbit voice of thomas brother bear white and preacher fox gordone and their adventures in harlem as expected in many of these bakshi efforts theres a mix of animation and liveaction that provides a unique pointofview from the writerdirector that is sure to offend some people another fascinating animated character is miss america whos a bigas in gigantic in every waywhite blonde woman dressed in skintight red white and blue stars and stripes who has a hold on a little black man and has him shot in one of the most sexually violent ways that was shockingly funny to me there are plenty of such scenes sprinkled throughout the picture of which another one concerning brother bears frontal anatomy also provided big laughs from me theres also a segment of a woman telling her baby of a cockroach she was friends with who left her that was touching with that part seeming to be a tribute to the comic strip artist george herriman i was also fascinated hearing grover washington jrs version of aint no sunshine heard as part of the score most compelling part of the picture was seeing the scatman himself depicted with his head in silhouette during the opening credit sequence singing and scatting to a song that has him using the nword in a satirical way when i saw a vhs cover of this movie years ago it had depicted brother rabbit in insolent mode in front of what looked like the warner circles with the slogan this movie will offend everybody that is ample warning to anyone who thinks all cartoons are meant for children that said i definitely recommend coonskin to fans of bakshi and of every form of animation,1
i watch a lot of movies dvd features and classics you name it the night i watched jericho mile my wife who had ordered it on the internet said she remembered it from when she was in high school that it had stayed with her all of these years somewhat reluctantly i sat down with our daughter son and was riveted from the opening sequence to the end titles we all were br br she who remembered the original and our kids 18 and 16 who had no idea what the movie was about couldnt believe it our favorite scene bar none when peter strauss so passionately bangs his fist down and says id do it again it didnt advocate violence because it was a defense crime but evoked such intensity we couldnt believe itwhen his fellow cell mates gave him their food in support of his efforts there wasnt a dry eye in our housebr br someone please make more movies like this one unbelievable,1
what noise fails to do is get us to understand its character tim robbins plays an obsessive new yorker who cant deal with the obtrusive noises of the city any longer particularly car alarms its an odd idea for a film which has about as much creative credibility as death wish it is clever at points particularly a scene in which our hero is trying to read through hagel im too stupid to be understanding this he reads and rereads a paragraph in confusion we read it and dont get it eitherjust then a car alarm goes off throughout the movie is constant interference of alarms and city noises though all in all it does little to help us understand our hero who allows this all to ruin his marriage and gets distracted with side plots instead of digging deeperinto his persona br br the filmmaking itself is too oblivious to notice its own sound problems shoddy editing and visible boom mikes no noise isnt allbad william hurt is at least colorful at least the ending doesnt fall flat overall it drives home a logistical point one you havent probably thought of at least i hadnt though all in all ninety minutes long it couldnt have ended sooner the story dragged on and seemed to be lost as soon as it startedbr br this is another one of those movies that you might see at a film festival but probably wont get picked up for distribution check it out on dvd if youre really partial to someone involved in the project otherwise skip it,0
ok lets start with the good nice scenery channing tatum is easy to look at amanda seyfried has nice hair thats about it how much of this movie went on the editing room floor probably the plot action good dialogue and point terrible acting horrible choppy dialogue let me tell you how bad it is my friend who always cries at movies got to the part that was meant to evoke tears and she laughed so hard we thought she was crying the movie seems to want to take a stab at too many issues war loss autism cancer but fails so miserably to cover any one topic satisfactorily make sure you have something to munch on and your cell phone to return text messages,0
this is a superb movie suitable for all but the very youngest though accessibility for younger people was marred at least in the print which i saw by the use of some unfortunate choice of english subtitling for much of the film it is almost impossible to guess in which timeperiod it is set there is no modern technology shown not even the ubiquitous chinese bicycle just a drab almost monochrome everyday life against which is contrasted the dazzling display of the sezuan opera and of celebratory fireworks even when a group of soldiers refer to their imminent departure for a theatre of war this could still be any time in the past 150 yearsbr br but then we briefly see a motor car late 30s early 40s style and we realise that we are watching a china on the verge of huge upheavals and that much of the world we are seeing is about to be swept away in the cataclysm of world war 2 and the communist revolutionbr br which makes the central characters desire to adhere to old customs and traditions all the more poignantbr br but the film also raises issues which are of vital importance even today both within china and in other parts of the world the inequality between boys and girls men and women the trade for various purposes in young children corruption in society injustice the importance of friendshipbr br maybe im reading too much into this film but i dont think so i also think that it is a scandal that films of this calibre are often not shown in the united kingdom whilst dross is passed off as quality materialbr br but dont get me started on that,1
wendigo is a pretty good psychological thriller the film has some great drama between the characters and some good creepy scenes the acting is good the characters act like a normal family the wendigo effects are good the deer form reminded me a little of the rabbit in donnie darkobr br the film sees a family going to stay at a house for a while but accidental hit a deer a group of hunters arrives and one of the hunters named otis starts to argue with the dad george after the car is lifted they drive off to the house the son miles is a little shook up about the deer but his parents try to tell him that its natural for things like that to happen that night while hes in bed he starts to see weird things in bedroom the next day they go into to town and miles meets a man at the counter who gives him a little statue of the wendigo when miles shows kim the statue and tells her that a man at the counter gave it him the owner says the she only works there once returning home george takes his son sledding and while there sledding hes knocked off the board and miles is chases by the wind after gaining conciseness they go looking for george they find him outside the house where he tells them he was shot in the hospital kim tells the sheriff that otis may have shot him the shrieff goes to otiss place where hes bashed over the head with a hammer as otis drives down the road he finds that the wendigo is after himbr br wendigo is a pretty good thriller that has some chilling moments check this out 1010,1
actually this flick made in 1999 has pretty good production values the actors are attractive and reasonably talented there arent a bunch of clowns running around blasting away expending hundreds of rounds but never hitting flesh nor are there wild car chasescrashes where thousands of dollars worth of beautiful machines are uselessly trashedbr br the interiors look respectably modern architecturally and the equipment looks up to snuff well there is that high tech computer room furnished with what look like leftovers from a 50s electronics lab and the pancake makeup on the corpses cracked me up not pancake makeup in the conventional sense but what looks like dried pancake batter slathered over their exposed skin this is supposed to support the idea that the bodies have calcified though how the virus would accomplish this transmutation is an exercise left for the student viewerbr br ah yes the virus i would like to tell you that this is not the absolute worst premise for a scifi horror flick i know of but i cant a computer virus that is transmitted via a television or computer monitor screen and becomes a lethal biological pathogen gimme a break warp drives a la star trek are one thing but photons becoming viruses this is so silly the desired fright factor just isnt realizable the flick could have used one of those awful dream sequences where the dead come alive or have a cat jump out of the closet or something because the viral thingamajig isnt doing it br br one presumes robert wagner has the same excuse for playing in this inanity that lord oliver gave for some of his later trashy venues he needed the money no other comparison between the two should be construedhowever,0
i had seen this movie as a kid and loved it i loved how spunky and full of energy nikki is and how she mostly ruins loudens perfect yuppie life and corrupts him and turns him on to her crazy ways as a kid in the 80s i saw new york exactly the way it was portrayed in this movie the domain of madonnas character with wild animals running rampant and hideous bald men chasing people around and causing havoc now as an adult i find i love the movie for the same reasons and even more so for the love story woven into the crazy antics of ms nikki finn although i would still love to go anywhere and find an indoor atrium like in this movie pure beauty and genius,1
dont let my constructive criticism stop you from buying and watching this romy schneider classic this movie was shot in a lower budget probably against the will of ernest marishka so he had to make duefor example england is portrayed as bordering on germanyby a will of the wisp victoria and her mom are taking a vacation to germany by buggy ride alonethey arrived their too quick this probably could not be helped but the castle they rented for the movie was austrian when shes told that shes queen she goes to the royal room where the members of the court bow to her where are the british citizens out side from the castle cheering for their new queen why isbnt she showing her self up to the balcony to greet her subjects low budgetwhere the audience back then aware of these imperfection i wonder how the critics feltdurring the inn scene she meets prince albert but isbnt excited about it durring the meeting in the eating side of the inn your hear music from famous old american civil war songs like my old kentucky home and old black joe what civil war songs in the 1830s is romy schneider being portrayed as scarletwheres mammy is magna shnieder playing her too is adrian hoven rhett or ashley what was in marishka mindwell this add to the campits unintentionally satirizing queen victoriaa story this is the only reason you should collect it or see it 03 11 09 correction germany and england are connected,1
long on action and stunt work but so short on character delineation and development that it failed to hold our interest not always easy to figure out which side a character is on and whos doing what to whom,0
i saw the film at the belgrade film festival last week and im still working off the trauma essentially my view seems to match a number of others the first half hour was fresh sharp deep entertaining and promising well acted too natural my problem however is not simply with the fact that the final hour and a half of the film have nothing to do with the likable beginning nor the fact that i spent most of this time convulsing in agony at sharp grating industrial sounds and squinting at drunken toothless breadchewing hags its rather with the fact that they never warned me the festival brochure synopsis described only the utterly intriguingsounding first half hour a whore piano tuner and meat seller chat in a bar pretending to be an advertising agent genetic engineer and petty government administration official respectively making no mention whatsoever of the neverending gumsmacking to come serves me right for not reading the reviews you might say but to my defense a number of reviews i looked at postfact um didnt at all stress the immensity and utter unbearableness of the greater part of the filmbr br the first hint should have been the introductory words by the director a bashful touslehaired russian youth who stepped in front of the crammed auditorium the film seems to be doing incredibly well critically and tickets were sold out well in advance of the screening though most of the audience seemed as unaware as i was of the pain to come judging by the plethora of unearthly moans and groans that utterly permeated the theatre during the last half hour and many exasperated comments on exit to say the following well i um thank you very much for coming to see this film and i just wanted to say well its a very long film it took me four years to make it and its i suggest that you see it and immediately try to forget about it it is very long thank you for coming this is what he said alarm bells should have been ringing whats he talking about i thought in happy confusion this is gonna be fun of course by the time his strangely apologetic comments started making sense to me it was far too late to get out all i could do is writhe in increasing agony until the lights came on again and in the end i cant say i feel in any way improved by the experience yes i absolutely loved the first half hour it was intelligent new and had a lot to say and yes russia is probably in a bad state yes every society has many hidden faces yes toothless life in barren wastelands is probably unimaginably hard yes yes yes i get all of this really i do but i see no earthly reason why art and meaning should be so agonisingly drawn out and so painful to bear if you want to see a film land somewhere between the extremes of glitzy hollywood plastic fantastic and hours,0
beyond dirt cheap this shotonvideo exercise in ineptitude was difficult to get through its got the typical gore that youd expect in a zombie movie but none of the required atmosphere to make it worth whilebr br whats strange is that this is an amateur german video and the version i saw is englishdubbed the dubbers seem to be american fans penpals of the germans who cant decide whether they want to play it straight or turn it into a comedy one character a white german of course is dubbed by a black guy apparently who speaks with thick ebonics kno wahm sayin comrad,0
pilot mitch macafee jeff morrow sees a ufo while test flying a planebut nothing shows up on radar then planes and ships start disappearing and reports of a ufo increase it turns out its a giant monster bird that is attacking and killing but what is it and why is it here br br this has all the right elements for a classic it has an actually pretty entertaining scripti was never really bored the acting is good for a 1950s monster movie morrow doesnt overdo the macho hero act and mara corday is quite good as the requisite female love interest shes also strong and takes care of herselfeven though she is off getting food and coffee for everyone all during the movie the problem here is the monster dear godits terrible it looks like a deranged turkey it has a long neck a hilariously stupid beak some teeth a few strands of hair on its head and claws andoh yesit squawks not roaringsquawking the actors had no idea what it looked likeit was added after production actors morrow and corday were horrified when they finally saw it in a theatre morrow said his audience burst out laughing and he left the theatre quickly before the movie ended producer sam katzman was responsible for this he wanted to save money and gave the world the stupidest monster ever and you can see the wires moving it too this gets 4 stars only because morrow and corday are so good and the script is well done it gets no stars for the pathetic monsterwait till you see it attack what is obviously a toy train worth a look if youre a horror fan to see what has to be the stupidest monster ever,0
as did others in this forum when fobidden planet was offered in 1956 i rushed to see it this story is an interesting phenomenon i suggest because young old male female scifi experts and people who find such fare way out all can follow and enjoy this films story and plot lines very well this is the first movie set on a planet other than earth in the 20th century other than serials such as flash gordon leslie nielsen was vocally a bit weak for his role at that time but walter pigeon marvin miller anne francis richard anderson earl holliman and especially warren stevens all acquitted themselves very well there are so many visual splendors in this one its hard to choose a favorite from the films scenes the approach to altair4 the starship itself the landing on the planets alien surface the descent via extensor stairs the first view of the landscape the approach of the rocketsled dr morbiuss house seen from without and from within the underground complex and its wonders the setup of the weaponry the battle with the monster the final approach of the unseen destroyerthe escape from the doomed planetall these scenes are etched into the viewers mind because we discover them along with the participants veteran cyril humes literate script was filmed intelligently by longtime director fred mcleod wilcox with clarity and imagination it is a shock to realize theres no music at all the film is carried by the words the actors and the mysteryrevelation storyline it can be watched again and again with pleasurei have been doing so for nearly fifty years until this famous and wellloved film was created no film had tried to imagine a world beyond earth and for decades afterward ships kept crashing back on the planetas if the writers imaginations were failing and causing the crashes still the best many say that says something negative about this nations socalled intellectual leaders imaginationsand something very positive indeed i suggest about those who made this gem,1
most of the comments on this movie are positive so i thought i would try and redress the balance i came out of this movie wondering what was going on i now know and still consider it to be a poor movie i intially discounted a dream sequence as that seemed too obvious i was glad that i had a free ticket to the movie or i would have asked for my money back movie reviewers and critics love this movie which only confirms to me that most of them would rather sound intelligent than review how an audience may enjoy a film the 8 rating this movie has is so misleading in 20 years time this film will not compare to true greats such as the godfather the film does have fine performances from both the leads but that isnt enough to save the film nor are the lesbian scenes,0
i dug out from my garage some old musicals and this is another one of my favorites it was written by jay alan lerner and directed by vincent minelli it won two academy awards for best picture of 1951 and best screenplay the story of an american painter in paris who tries to make it big nina foch is a sophisticated lady of means and is very interested in helping him but soon finds she loves the guy meanwhile gene kelly falls for lovely damsel leslie caron his main dancing partner and i must say they are fantastic together on the floor and otherwise famous french singer georges guietary sings too so if you like good smooth dancing and fun filled scenes filled with oscar levants nimble piano fingers the songs of george gershwyn will live on forever in this colorful gem 810,1
i was lucky enough to read the book beforehand and i do know a little about tudor englandbr br the writing directing and editing of this tv movie for the most part was truly awful i felt as if i was watching a really bad drama doc about the period rater then a moviebr br first there were too many cuts between important parts and leaving out important events which happened at the time one is henrys fall out with rome over his desire to divorce katherine of aragon which led to englands breaking away from rome and establishing her own church they barely stuck to the book at all im all for creative freedom but to a limit especially when your dealing with a well written book as your starter point in the book mary gives birth to young catherine first and then she has young henry is born both their father is henrys the eight in the movie they show harrys first then catherine and suggest that catherine father is william careybr br there are too many bad moments in the movie to write them allbr br i will however say that jodhi may and natascha mcelhone portrayal as the boleyn sisters was probably the best part of the moviebr br if you havent read the book and know nothing about hennrys the 8 court i will recommend to stay away from this movie and for those who read the book the movie will annoy you for its lack of details and important plots,0
there are two kinds of 1950s musicals first you have the glossy mgm productions with big names and great music and then you have the minor league with a less famous cast less famous music and second rate directors the girl cant help it belongs to the latter category neither tom ewell or edmond obrien became famous and jayne mansfield was famous for her well never mind seems like every decade has its share of bo dereks or pamela andersons the plot itself is thin as a razorblade and one cant help suspect that it is mostly an attempt to sell records for fats domino little richard or others of the 1950s rock acts that appear in the movie if that music appeals to you this is worth watching if not dont bother,0
i saw this flick on the big screen as a kid and loved it cheeziness and all recently i found a copy on video and checked it out again badly made sure schlocky fun most definitely it still packs an entertaining punch its much more fun than the dull disney version alive the only thing alive did better were the special effects if youre a lover of bmovies i highly recommend survive not to mention all the other rene cardona jnr movies and the mexican wrestling flicks made by his father rene cardona snr survive is long overdue for dvd special edition treatment are you listening all you kind folk at anchor bay,1
even though i have great interest in biblical movies i was bored to death every minute of the movie everything is bad the movie is too long the acting is most of the time a joke and the script is horrible i did not get the point in mixing the story about abraham and noah together so if you value your time and sanity stay away from this horror,0
i like most other people saw this movie after hearing of it from patton oswalt oddly enough it was easier to find than i thought it would be though it shouldnt come as a surprise that i found it usedbr br the plot is summed upped masterfully within the title its a bed that eats nothing more nothing less there is an effort to throw in a story line but not a very good onebr br a demons blood ended up on a bed and as a result it becomes possessed it devours anything that happens upon it by absorbing and then dissolving it in what appears to be orange fanta there is an artist who fell victim to the bed but was sick and ends up behind a painting in the room it inhabits the narrative is told entirely through himbr br this movie fails horribly at everything even at being bad still its not without its own brand of charm,0
gayniggers from outer space is pretty much summed up by its name running only 27 minutes long it describes a spaceship of gay blacks that come to earth to free the men from women while i see a little significance to the plot it also is really illogical granted its meant to be a comedyspoof on society and science fiction i found myself laughing several times so it succeeds therebr br the special effects are horrible when the spaceship is floating above the earth you can see stars zoom by for no apparent reason the asteroids shown in the beginning look fake the equipment on the ship is illogical there are several misspellings in the text the actors are unconvincing the characters are messed up in general the whole thing doesnt take itself seriously if you get past all the aspects that make it a bad movie its very accessible and easy to see through to the end some parts are hilarious but overall the only thing that you are left remembering is that it was one of the most ridiculous concepts everbr br seeing that its a short film and has some funny aspects its not the worst thing to see but its illogical and holds little longterm value i cant really recommend it if you do watch it do so for the unique concept not the quality,0
without a doubt this is one of the worst pictures i ever actually paid money to see the kind of flick you choose out of desperation at the mall cinema during a christmas holiday when you have missed the start times for anything good but still are dead set on seeing a movie and that is exactly how i came to see this stink bombbr br at the distance of the better part of three decades i can still smell the rotting fish that constitute this story line unbelievable plot that a killer whale carries a grudge against an individual not of the sea is laughable and thats about all except for a completely outofplace love theme that plays over the finish of a film devoid of a love story at least charlotte rampling is lovely in a two dimensional role but richard harris just chews up the scenery he was no captain quint robert shaw and this is no jaws mercifully i have put most of it out of mind and when i run across it on television air casts i move on immediately danger will robinson see the current tv commercial showing a husband and wife whalewatching orca i love orca at least it is over in sixty seconds this flick represents 92 minutes of my life that i will never get back,0
this film is one of my fondest childhood memories seeing the muppets at the height of their popularity heading hollywood singing and dancing with miss piggy googelyeying her beloved kermit fozzie bear doing his best as everyones manager and a generous cast of extras delivering a film that turned out to be okey dokeybr br kermits melancholy ukulele number rainbow connection was nominated for an oscar that year but was beat out by norma raes it goes like it goes ill pick kermits song any day get the kids and enjoy this timeless fantasysomeday theyll find it the rainbow connections the lovers the dreamers and me,1
i wont spend a lot of time nor energy on this comment i just want to add it because all the comments were so positive i felt like i just had to let people know that not everyone is so thrilled let alone intellectually provoked by this attempt at creating a captivating philosophical cinematic enigma some scenes seemed promising playing with visual dimensions but couldnt hold up the rest i felt like i was stoned for the first time again having semiphilosophical conversations with fellow adolescentsbr br what a futile attempt to raise dutch cinema to new heights id rather watch jesus is een palestijn without all the pretentions and with straight forward humor also raising questions about life and the realities we create for ourselvesbr br gert de graff is not jeanluc godard or tarkovsky and appearantly never will be,0
i thought this movie was very well done taking place in the mid 1950s everything looked accurate to me it was well cast and believable i dont usually care much for this type of movie because they just dont have any depth but i felt this movie delved in to the characters and you could feel how they felt you got to really know them and care about them it did take me back to my youth and let me reminiscent about a more innocent time this movie could be enjoyed by both male and female and by all age groups after the movie was over i wished there was a part two i wanted to know what happened to dani and her family this movie is bound to be a classic if you havent seen it you should try to catch it when it is on tv or rent it,1
the only thing that the first power really has going for it is that it affords jeff kober an opportunity to play one of his lovely variety of psychotic villains that hes done so well in the last 25 years kober is a worthy successor to lyle bettger who specialized in those parts back in the fiftiesbr br but its not enough the first power is a souped up slasher flick that has lou diamond phillips wasted as an lapd detective who has a specialty in catching serial killers kober is his latest catch but kobers in league with a lower power and theyre going to team up and make lous life miserable for him even after kober is given the gas chamber his spirit comes back in all kinds of guisesbr br mykelti williamson is on hand as lous partner who meets a nasty end involving a demon possessed horse and tracy griffith as a psychic and elizabeth arlen as a nun with insights are around to help lou will he succeed in battling forces from beyondbr br by the time the film ends you no longer care lou really got trapped in a turkey maybe the devil made him do this film,0
this is a great idea for a film but it unfortunately doesnt turn out to be a great movie what starts out as a sweet and almost goofy romantic comedy about a fluffer in love with his fluffee spirals out of control into a bizarre combination of genres and a veritable stew of plots with liberal borrowings from boogie nights thelma and louise showgirls frisk and even a curious dash of 400 blows thrown in towards the end at least the director did his research the result is not necessarily boring but in the end this slick wellproduced flick doesnt quite add up to anything however the actors all do a game job with the material and there are a few good laughs at the behindthescenes world of gay pornbr br,0
first off let me say if you havent enjoyed a van damme movie since bloodsport you probably will not like this movie most of these movies may not have the best plots or best actors but i enjoy these kinds of movies for what they are this movie is much better than any of the movies the other action guys segal and dolph have thought about putting out the past few years van damme is good in the movie the movie is only worth watching to van damme fans it is not as good as wake of death which i highly recommend to anyone of likes van damme or in hell but in my opinion its worth watching it has the same type of feel to it as nowhere to run good fun stuff,0
simply but imaginatively filmed studioset performance short a perfect match of music and images that defines the very coolness of cool and the hipness of hip the precise visual and musical arrangements give the lie to its claim to be a record of a jam session what it is is a pop video every bit as stylised and knowing as that implies and all the better for it among the very best music films ever made and almost certainly the most cinematic these cats are solid gone daddyo,1
i was a guest at the sept 30th screening of eddie monroe and was pleasantly surprised with the story the great acting and the talented directing i found it hard to believe that all this talent can be found in an independent film powerful performances by vario uncle benny sara jessica tsunis and morris eddie monroe the supporting cast was chock full of colorful and amusing characters this film reminds me of one of those movies that you will look back on in 20 years and discover that it launched many actors into stardom much like the outsiders where tom cruise emilio estavez patrick swazey ralph macchio and others can be found look out hollywood there are new stars out on the horizon and they can be discovered in a little long island independent film called eddie monroe great job,1
the dialogue was pretty dreadful the plot not really all that inspired beyond the obvious twist it presents not visually stunning actually visually annoying at times most definitely one of those films you find easier to finish if you keep one finger on the fast forward button if you could watch it for free have absolutely no other options open at the moment and you really dig seeing the little poltergeist lady well maybe id recommend it to you but not anyone else i could think of at the moment,0
i cant understand why many seem to hate thisbr br this movie ties together many of the overlapping settings of the historical and biblical epics of the fifties using set pieces props and costumes similar to those seen in other movies here however the story attempts to run through all of human history with a frame story about the human race being on trial with a guilty verdict meaning hbombs will go off all over the world the prosecutor is the devil played with fiendish glee by vincent price ok so its a little hokey calling the defender the spirit of all men but i think thats one of the things that gives this movie a sense of period charm the spririt of man is incidentally played quite well by ronald coleman in his last film it is also the last movie in which groucho harpo and chico marx all appear but not together groucho plays peiter minuet buying manhattan from the indians in a scene played purely for campy humor chico isnt funny at all as a monk who thinks the world is flat and harpo we are told is meant to be isaac newton discovering gravity most of the other performances are well done thoughbr br other hokey things are that the trial is supposedly taking place in outer space which is depicted as a region of clouds and blueness there is something called the great clock of outer space which when striking midnight may signal the end of the worldbr br but at its heart the movie addresses the problems of wmds and the eternal question of whether man is basically good or basically evil and poses it in what i think is an interesting way also anyone who likes the look of costume epics of the fifties should like the look of this movie,0
my mom would not let me watch this film when i was in grade 2 because she said it was too violent well years later and the only reason i remember this film is because of my mom i stayed up and watch it on pbs well maybe the build up after all these year lead to the big disapointment of this film but i found it lame it did not age well and this made the acting choppy huge unbelievable holes in the script but there is a few cool scenes like car chases and a big gun fight i will not stay up for this film again,0

this movies chronicles the life and times of william castle he made a series of low budget horror films in the 1950s1960s that he sold with gimmicks in 13 ghosts you need viewers to see the ghosts they were in color the film was in bw the tingler had theatre seats equipped with a buzzer that jolted the audience when a monster escapes into a movie theatre marabre issued a life insurance policy to all members in case they were frightened to death the movies themselves were pretty bad but the gimmicks had people rushing to see them in this doc there are interviews with directors inspired by castle actors in his movies and his daughter it also gets into his home life and the kind of man he was by all accounts he was a great guy the documentary is affectionate very funny and absolutely riveting its very short under 90 minutes and theres never a dull moment a must see for castle fans and horror movie fans my one complaintthere were very few sequences shown from his pictures that aside this is just great,1
i sincerely wonder why this film was ever made a bulgarianitalian coproduction set in a version of berlin where all germans speak english with a german accent and all turks speak english with some turkish words in between is hardly credible the english vocabulary is basically limited to fuck you bastard and the acting is worse than anyone can imagine apart from this racial tensions in germany can be an interesting subject but in the germany i know there are no gangs shooting each other in the middle of the street in clear daylight and if all that is not enough there is also a serial killer going around who kills turkish children and paints them white in order to create some tension we see the serial killer and hear him hum schuberts lullaby but we wont see his face br br i dont even believe they actually shot it in germany there are some street shots that are quite obviously in berlin but the actors are not seen in those shot its probably bulgaria with some german signs added here and there,0
okay pretty good doesnt scream rent me but i was surprised at how much i enjoyed campfire tales while by no means a classic the directors involved do have an idea what suspense is the scares dont just jump out at you but instead the directors build steadily to the climatic moments the film is based upon popular urban legends and ghost stories the writers have updated the tales rather well and twisted them just enough that the familiar endings still pack a punch the best of the shorts are the honeymoon and people can lick too i enjoyed both as they have nice suspense throughout each story the locket was a good ghost story and the wrap around the campfire is pretty good too except they go for one too many twists at the end the only disappointing segment is the hook which is fine because its pretty short anyway overall i give this a 7 out of 10 it has suspense which is lacking from most horror movies today and good acting by the cast it may not rate up there with halloween and the exorcist but its a good little movie well worth the price of a rental,1
seeing that this got a theatrical release nowhere around the globe it only serves as a reminder of were the careers of those talentfree ladies denise richards and milla jovovich went it also is a particular grating kind of movie the kind that think they are smart funny and original while being poor in every aspect full blame can go to brian burns who wrote and directed this potboiler his script takes a quite unoriginal situation and goes exactly nowhere with it the situations develop completely without any inner logic besides that of a desperate scriptwriter characters are thinner than cardboard cutouts behave stupid and without any real motivation nowhere is this more obvious than in the inclusion of mrs richards we dont believe her relationship with david krumholtzs character for one minute and the way she is brought back into play after the onehour mark is particularly pitiful why would anyone fall for a egocentric selfobsessed arrogant bch like this in the first place much less a second time especially after having supposedly found hisermtrue love and if any of these things arent enough to completely sink this movie than the central couple is the coupling of krumholtz and jovovich is only slightly more believable or developed than the richardsone but it is to no avail there is no chemistry no spark nothing that we might loosely accept as a credible couple worse these two central characters are particularly annoying and irritating doing annoying and irritating things the viewer finally has no interest in whatsoeverbr br overall a very poor showing even diehard romcom fans might want to pass on this one as there are dozens of movie made with more skill or more charm,0
amateur camera work aside i thought this movie was very different and unlike all the blogs and posts i have read i got something totally different out of the ending than others the premise of the story revolves around a very religious family and their ties to their church how they must adhere to all the rigid rules and regulations but the daughter seems to have problems staying on track what with nasty thoughts of others and her use of bad language yet she prays a lot as does her family then one day they are headed to a church picnic and are in an accident from there the parents and her brother change what with being knocked out and saved by jesus warning major spoiler alert or so we are led to believe i think if you watch this movie from the point of view of the daughter only then really pay attention to the end you will see that what we the audience thinks is an actual occurrence with the parents and son is in fact all a dream and from the daughters pov this would explain a lot of the actions portrayed by the parents and the son which were totally opposite of how they lived before especially the sex and also would also explain why peggy got away with murder etc look at how perfect that pie is but go back and look at the cake betty makes that is unless caroline removed all evidence that the pie was laced and also the fact that the scene where she sees her dead parents laying there in each others arms and her brother all whom of which seemed to die very peacefully even if being poisoned fits with a dream sequence,1
when i first saw the trailer for the comebacks it looked absolutely horrible and i had no interest in seeing it but when it came out on dvd today i figured since there was nothing else that caught my interest i would rent it and give it a shot i watched it tonite and it really wasnt that bad i think it was immature and stupid at times but there were a few funny moments that made me laugh i dont really watch many sports movies so i wonder maybe if i saw more maybe this movie would make more sense to me but its all good i still didnt mind so much watching the comebacks i admit these stupid spoof movies are lame but whats the harm in a stupid joke every once in a while the comebacks isnt really that bad if you give it a fair chancebr br coach fields is failing in life family and career both but when he is offered a chance to bring his career back to life if he can bring a looser football team into the championship but the team is really really terrible like beyond terrible but with a little work and team effort they try to give it their all even though that might turn into something more sadbr br the comebacks over all isnt the worst film ive seen i think its good for a couple laughs and giggles i know that this was stupid but i couldnt help but laugh when the coach comes in the middle of a fight in the locker room and hes beating the nerds head against the locker just him and the nerd in general were so funny together if you have an open mind and dont take this movie too seriously i think youll have a fun time watching it if you watch it expecting it to be oscar worthy material this is not the movie for youbr br 410,0
jake speed is a fine movie with a wonderful message it has its flaws of course at times its a little slow it introduces its villain too far into the story its action is paced at the rate of a snails heartbeat it has a zgrade cast although ive always admired the work of karen kopins who has the straightlaced good looks of sandra bullockbr br but with all this going against it jake speed really is inspiring thanks to a charming script by wayne crawfordwho plays the title role and andrew lanebr br why do i find it so inspiring because it says to me hey why not try to be a good personbr br the story is essentially a stranger in a strange land premise that is goodandheroic jake speed is placed in the real world where bad things happen to good people jake is more than a boy scout hes more than a knight in shining armor jake speed is the patron saint of optimism in a dirty mean and evil worldbr br its because of this that jake speed really needed to be a hit it has a great message that should have gotten out to hollywood and then to the rest of the worldbr br imagine a movie industry that really pushed itself to portray good and decent people im not saying that we should be watching the waltons in every theater at the cineplex but that it would be nice if more movies such as jake speed would get a chance due south a tv show about a canadian mountie is a good comparison of what can be done to brighten up american entertainmentbr br sure jake speed has violence blood and guns but the overall message is that if you try hard enough to be a good person youll beat the forces of evil every time 101499,1
after not having much luck at selling his screenplays to the new movie industry during the first decade of the 20th century in 1908 playwright dw griffith got the job that would make him a legend he was hired by the biograph company as a director of movies it wasnt really what griffith had expected when he decided to enter the movie business but he accepted the job and in less than a year he became biographs most successful director thanks to his original approach to filmmaking and the wild inventive of his narrative many years later he would direct the birth of a nation in 1915 the movie that would revolutionize filmmaking and make him one of cinemas first recognized authors however a lot of what would make him a great filmmaker can be found in the many short films he made for biograph company in the early years of his career 1909s the sealed room is one of those and also one of the few horror movies of that very first decade of the 20th centurybr br the sealed room is a story set in the 16th century in which a count arhtur v johnson has built a windowless room in his castle it is a small yet nice and very cozy room as it is meant to be used to enjoy the love and company of his wife the countess marion leonard in a more private way however the count doesnt know that his wife is not exactly faithful as she is infatuated with the minstrel henry b walthall at court with whom she is having an affair as soon as the count gets busy with his own business the countess calls the minstrel and both lovers go to enjoy the counts new room when the count returns he discovers she is missing and begins to suspect finally discovering the two lovers in his room but instead of making a scene he prefers to remain hidden as he decides that there is a better punishment for his unfaithful wife to seal the windowless room with the couple insidebr br written by griffiths regular collaborator frank e woods the sealed room takes elements from edgar allan poes the cask of amontillado and mainly honoré de balzacs la grande breteche to create a haunting gothic melodrama based on the themes of treachery and sadism despite having a runtime of 11 minutes woods screenplay develops the story in a very good way and plays remarkably well with the horror elements of the story while a melodrama at heart woods focus on the character of the count and his sadism creates one of the best horror characters of these early era the sealed room is definitely a very simple and basic story but woods handling of the dark and morbid thematic of its plot makes the story a very entertaining film that was very different than most griffiths melodramasbr br in the sealed room griffith uses his talents to experiment with tension and suspense in a different way than his usual while he,1

turner and friends are closing in on hbo for the top spot among madefortv movie producers this is a nicely paced contemplative thriller of sorts william macy is stellar as always and adam arkin offers one of his better performances a bit more lively than classic hitchcock but not as inyourface as typical movies of its type a slight case of murder eases you in and never lets go note i saw a preview copy which means i didnt have to wait through commercials those interruptions may hurt the pacing but you know this will be available on video sometime,1

a very good episode although not as devastating a finale as the end of season 1 the idea to make it a desmond flashback worked very well and henry ian cusick was fantastic perhaps putting in the best performance of this entire series but my only complaint would be the michael plot line felt very much like a subplot and after three minutes the previous episode i thought it would feature more but the strength of cusicks character and performance pulled it through the plot developments as always left more questions then answers like who are the others something we still dont know and where are they taking jack sawyer and kate what was the white light what impact has it had are locke eko and desmond dead as the hatch destructed around them if they are it would be a major mistake because these three are the most interesting characters and the series would suffer without them and terry oquinn has been fantastic throughout both series as locke a fitting finale to a better series then the first,1

when i saw this movie circa 1979 it became the first movie that i ever walked out of in the middle there is nothing worse than comedy that just misses being funny and this misses every time although i cant speak for the last 25 minutes of the movie there was nothing original about any of the skits while i enjoy racy humor where appropriate these skits were needlessly vulgar what was even more irritating was that this movie was advertised as robin williams first movie capitalizing on his new found fame in the mork and mindy television series yet his role turned out to be so minor that you cannot even notice him onscreen,0

this movie has a few good performances going for it and thats all it has going for it the leads especially pauley perrette are appealing although some of the bit players seem to be acting from a teleprompter the material that is the problem i feel as though the screenwriterdirector watched the entire run of felicity in one sitting then sat down to write a script without catching any sleep it really did remind me of felicity a thoughtful young woman finding herself finding love with a shakethemupand seewhathappens approach to the characters and their relationships except that while i usually enjoyed watching felicity this movie left me cold the writing is just awful its amazing that the cast could come off as well as they did as the dialogue is dull at best at its worst it becomes trite stilted and amateurish there is nothing original here with plot elements recycled from gimmicks that werent so brilliant to begin with angels and fortune tellers come on for the first half of the movie i rooted for the actors and hoped to be rewarded for my patience by the second half i just wished for it to end already my sympathies to the cast who deserved a better vehicle for their talents,0

so theres this bride you see and she gets crushed to death by this statue that falls on her on the day of her wedding then get this a year later her former fiancé falls in love with a beautiful psychic and then that beautiful psychic gets haunted by the ghost of the disgruntled dead bride who wants to keep her from stealing her boyfriend he he itll be hilarious polite chucklingbr br this i like to envision is how jeff lowell the man who dreamed up over her dead body presented his concept to the studio execs over there at new line cinema the big mystery is how those very same corporate bigwigs could then turn right around and green light the project allowing lowell to direct the film as well as write the screenplaybr br for if you think that no movie could ever possibly be as bad as this original premise sounds then clearly you have another think coming the only way in which it might have worked is if the writer had simply gone crazy with it and turned it into a noholdsbarred satirical farce instead wanting to ensure that he delivered a fuzzy inoffensive and warmhearted romantic comedy lowell engages in boring halfmeasures every step of the way tamping down the absurdity in favor of drab conventionality indeed over her dead body is so thoroughly inept and unfunny that its hard to know where exactly lowell thought he was going with it virtually every setup joke and sight gag in the film is flatfooted and poorly executed with even the actors themselves seemingly aware of their predicament how else to explain the halfhearted lifeless performances of paul rudd eva langoria parker lake bell and jason biggs in their various roles br br i choose not to blame the actors some of whom have proved their talents in better vehicles in the past that is particularly the case with rudd but lowell and those studio execs sure have some splainin to do,0
after a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted urban turn of the century australian street we meet julie rebecca gibney and peter john adam as they go out house hunting they manage to get a loan for a fixerupper on a posh sydney street but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem with their new home it just may be hauntedbr br 13 gantry row combines a memorable if somewhat clichéd story with good to average direction by catherine millar into a slightly above average shockerbr br the biggest flaws seem partially due to budget but not wholly excusable to that hurdle a crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film the opening thriller scene features some wonky editing freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that theres not much action suspense should be created from staging not fancy fix it in the mix techniques there is great atmosphere in the scene from the location the lighting the fog and such but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street showing their increasing proximity the tracking and the cuts need to be slow the attack needed to be longer clearer and better blocked as it stands the scene has a strong made for television feel and a low budget one at thatbr br after this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves the story has a lot of similarities to the amityville horror 1979 though the budget forces a much subtler approach millar and scriptwriter tony morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios often dramatic in nature instead of special effectsoriented such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wallbr br for some horror fans the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama at least the first half hour of the film is primarily about julie and peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in but morphett writes fine intelligent dialogue the material is done well enough that its often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise laterespecially if youve gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own housebr br once they get settled and things begin to get weirder even though the special effects often leave much to be desired the ideas are good the performances help create tension there isnt an abundance of death and destruction in the filmtheres more of an abundance of home repair nightmares but neither menace is really the pointbr br the point is human relationships there are a number of character arcs that are very interesting the house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship,1
this is yet another western about a greedy cattle baron looking to push out small ranchers and farmers its certainly all been done before and since but the violent men is something specialbr br what makes it special is barbara stanwyck playing the role of vixen as she often did in her later films shes married to the crippled edward g robinson whos the cattle baron here but robinson is crippled and there is some hint that his injuries may have left him impotent no matter to barbara whose needs are being met by her brotherinlaw brian keith that doesnt sit well with either dianne foster who is robinson and stanwycks daughter nor with lita milan who is keiths mexican girl friendbr br the infidelity subplot almost takes over the film but glenn ford as the stalwart small rancher who is a civil war veteran come west for his health manages to hold his own here hes every inch the quiet western hero who people make the mistake of pushing once too often i almost expect those famous words from wild bill elliott to come out of fords mouth im a peaceable man would have been very applicable in the vioilent menbr br the fifties was the age of the adult western themes were entering into horse operas that hadnt been explored before the following year glenn ford would do another western jubal one of his best which also explores infidelity as a plot componentbr br theres enough traditional western stuff in the violent men and plenty for those who are addicted to soap operas as well,1
yes he is no not because of pintilie likes to undress his actors and show publicly their privies pintilie is the naked emperor so to speakbr br its big time for someone to state the truth this impostor is a voyeur a brat locked in an old mans body his abundance of nude scenes have no artistic legitimacy whatsoever it is 100 visual perversion he gets his kicks by making the actors strip in the buff and look at their willies and if he does this in front of the audience he might eve get a hardon did you know that on the set of niki ardelean he used to embarrass poor coca bloss by telling her oh coca how i wanna f you she is a great lady very decent and sensitive and she became unspeakably ashamed to his petty satisfaction and as a worrying alarm signal about the degree of vulgarity and lack of education in romanian audiences so many people are still so foolish to declare these visual obscenities works of art will anyone have ever the decency to expose the truth of it all,0
philo vance william powell helps solve multiple murders among the wealthy after a dog showbr br usually i hate overly convoluted mysteries like this but i love this movie it moves very quickly only 72 minutes is beautifully directed by michael curtiz he uses tons of camera tricks that just speed the narrative along has a very ingenious story line including a solution to a locked room murder that was just incredible and has a very good cast br br powell is very suave and great as vancehe doesnt seem to be actinghe is vance mary astor isnt given much to do but she adds class and beauty to the production everybody else is very good too but best of all is eugene pallette as detective heath hes a very good actor with a very distinctive voice and some of his lines were hilariousbr br basically an excellent 1930s hollywood murder mystery well worth seeingbr br,1
that word true in this films title got my alarm bells ringing they rang louder when a title card referred to americas civil war as the war between the states the circumlocution preferred by diehard southerners jesse james thief slaveholder and murderer is described as a quiet gentle farm boybr br how dishonest is this movie there is no mention of slavery far less of the documented fact that jesse jamess poor widdered mother owned slaves before the war and that jesse and his brother frank actively fought to preserve slavery according to this movie all those civil war soldiers were really fighting to decide whether missouri is a northern state or a southern state thats all missouri its a candy mint its a breath mint black people are entirely absent from this movie except for two glimpses of a pair of beggars one of whom wears a help the poor sign thats very implausibly typeset instead of handwritten some shots of 19thcentury newspapers are inaccurate too with 20thcentury type fontsbr br this film has a weird flashback structure theres some very impressive stunt riding and some fine work by stunt horses and one excellent montage i savoured one line of dialogue some of those boys will never taste beans again the movie gets a few facts straight agnes moorehead as jesses mother conceals her right arm in the scenes following the raid by the agents of pinkerton here called remington in which jesse jamess reallife mother suffered injuries requiring the amputation of her lower arm some errors here are pardonable during his bushwhacking days the real jesse james accidentally shot off part of his left middle finger but robert wagner in the title role here does not have a stumpfinger ive seen a photo of jesse jamess real wife if she had looked half as glamorous as hope lange looks in this movie jesse james might have stayed home morebr br theres plenty of revisionism here and most of the male actors wear 1950s hairstyles but many of this movies errors were avoidable jesse jamess mentor william quantrill is mentioned several times but all the actors mispronounce his name we see jesse and his wife moving into an elaborate twostorey house where he will soon die after paying a rent of 18 actually jesse jamess last residence at 1318 lafayette street st joseph missouri was a simple onestorey cottage renting for 14 there was no upper storey so when jesse james is killed his wife could not come running from upstairs as hope lange does here she was actually in the kitchenbr br one continuity error robert wagner with no stunt double does an impressive job of taking a slug to the jaw and falling over while his hands are tied behind his back but when he gets up the rope binding his wrists has vanishedbr br the screenplay does some weird and unnecessary juggling of dates following the northfield robbery attempt jesse says he expects to get home by his birthday the actual northfield bank raid by the james gang,0
ive seen many horror splatter monster movies in my life and of course also a lot of monster movies from the 50s and 60s when i first stumbled over this one i thought this is from the 60s until i recognized its from 2007br br in fact the character of jack brook is interesting and the acting all in all is for a splatter movie quite good but i expected a splatter movie and not a drama story about a aggressive plummer the movie runs 80 mminutes and i think the first kill is after 65 minutes although it takes hours to explain the story the reason where are the monsters come from takes at least 3 minutes the we have another 20 minutes boring dialogue and finally a in my opinion not that well managed splatter sequence although we have robert englund starring here i only recommend this one to real hardcore horror fans,0
i cant get over how lazy the director is with this movie instead of setting up scenes in a creative way he relies on boring old zombie clichésbr br where the two unarmed leads have to get down the college steps into the van he surrounds them with zombies yet neither of the leads is bitten he cant be bothered to direct a decent fight scene so we see the leads shove their way down the stepsbr br sometimes the zombies limp about and at others they run like the wind this is really convenient for the director because he can set up anything he likes without bothering with continuity in the behaviour of the zombiesbr br with careful planning and a lot more inspiration this movie could have been so much better,0
i havent seen all of jess francos movies i have seen 5 i think and there are more than 180 of them so maybe its a bit early to say so but necronomicon geträumte sünden better known as succubus but that is the cut version is according to me if not the best certainly on of francos best franco is best known although known might be slightly exaggerated for vampiros lesbos a weird cultish movie that got more acclaim in the mid 90s when people found out jess franco was also an interesting composer through the soundtrack a happy few discovered the man and found out what was to be expected after seeing the video clip of the lion and the cucumber vampyros lesbos ost jess franco is an overwhelming director when the phone rang during vampiros i let it ring i just wanted to see more of the movie since that moment franco never could grip me that much but then i stumbled on this movie it is even better than vampiros lesbos i think franco is looking for what he can do with a story and a camera we find out he can do a lot i certainly didnt expect to find necronomicon that great its beginning didnt impress me at all remember i had seen vampiros lesbos before although chronologically that came only three years later and both movies kinda start the same but then the story went on puzzling and gripping beautiful camera work and the stuff you would like to see godard do if he werent so occupied with spreading his political messages later on in the movie i heard a dialogue about which art was or wasnt oldfashioned the man says that all movies have to be oldfashioned because it takes weeks before the audience sees what got filmed but the girl replies that bunuel fritz lang and godard yesterday made movies for tomorrow janine reynaud is an interesting lead actress and of course howard vernon a franco regular is also there luckily the acting is good something that can spoil a lot of franco movies for you but not this one but certainly watch out for the dummy scene the erotic tension the wild directing and the fact that its a yesterdays movie for tomorrow make it a movie a lot of people should see the fact that it is a bit more accessible than vampiros lesbos certainly helps,1
i first heard about commanders log when i was on the concom for the local science fiction convention craig bowlsby linden banks sophie banks and brian oberquell came out to show the video and give a couple of panels on making tv on a shoestring budget i have to say that i was very pleased when i finally had the chance to see the show comparisons with red dwarf are inevitable since the first seasons of red dwarf were also shot on a low budget although commanders log has to set some kind of record for the least amount of money spent per minute of air time and thus have to make up for the lack of eye candy with good writing and acting linden banks who plays chief petty officer blather does a particularly good job of presenting an earnest but clueless personabr br bowlsbys original idea was for the story to be told in two minute interstitials shown in between other shows over the course of an evening although for some reason space didnt get how cool an idea this would have been and so the interstitials were all rolled up into a onehour show which space normally showed in two halfhour episodes the existing dvd doesnt include episode 3 which premiered at cascadiacon in seattle in 2005 or episode 4 which was previewed at vcon in vancouver in 2006 but if youre in touch with your local fannish community you may catch news of a showing somewhere near you,1
i loved it fred macmurray is wonderful as skid johnson a somewhat conceited proud yet at the same time very vulnerable saxophone player who is in love with maggie carole lombard whos always there for him they meet in panama after maggie comes off a ship and end up in a bar with anthony quinn tony gets punched in the nose after her insults maggie by thinking her a loose woman all because she took off her hat in public big brawl and maggie ends up stuck in panama romance carole and arthur are great together maggie is always there for him whenever he needs her she urges him to go to ny where well watch the movie and find out they have these wonderful scenes together where she sings in his arms while he plays the saxophone i definitely recommend it,1
rock hudsons second venture in the science fiction genre after seconds is embryo a film that combines elements of the bride of frankenstein and pygmalion in one rather weird film about for lack of a better word a test tube baby that grows up to be barbara carrerabr br hudson is scientist experimenting in organic development and gets a chance to first experiment on his own doberman pincher when it is accidentally hit by his car br br some pituitary secretions from the female dog are given to a prematurely born puppy and it grows remarkably into an adult exalted with his success hudson takes a fetus from a dead accident victim and gives it some of the same stuffbr br what he gets is barbara carrera and she develops physically and intellectually at a prodigious rate what she doesnt do is develop emotionally still hudson passes her off as his new research assistant to friends and family like sisterinlaw diane ladd son john elerick and daughterinlaw anne schedeen br br embryo doesnt explore some of the real issues in this kind of science it exploits them instead the special effects as they are are pretty second rate hudson looks like he lost interest in the project about halfway through the filmbr br now what would have really been interesting is if he had gotten boy child and it grew up to be a harlequin novel hero now that would have been something rock hudson could have sunk his teeth into,0
rock star is a welltold hollywoodstyle rendition of the tale based on fact actually on how ripper became rob halfords replacement for judas priest mark wahlberg poured on his likable boyish charm and performed with believable admirably something he has been known to do since the release of boogie nightsbr br stephen herek no stranger to musicallythemed movies takes the audience through the wonders of the breakneck lifestyle of an extinct species the hairmetal rock god wahlbergs izzy acts as the films host plays the everyman who gets to see his wish come true his likable character quickly wins over the heart of the viewer who wants to see him succeed and gets the chance to give him the metal goat horn handsign several times overbr br the only real complaint with the story is that the supporting cast namely the other members of the band were not fleshed out or even introduced properly more interaction with these lifelong rock musicians would have amplified and solidified izzys new surroundings br br naturally rock star is filled with great music rabins score the steel dragons original work and plenty of 80sstyle metal hits makes this soundtrack a musthave lets all hope that films like rock star not only give a credibility to a style of music that helped define a generation but also spark a veryneeded revival,1
20 years later and this movie still has echoes of its greatness floating around never has a movie surpassed valley girls incredible soundtrack the movie completely encapsulated the 80s to such a perfect degree that it could only be realized this many years later nicolas cage at his best a movie that just has so much character to it that it makes you realize how sad hollywood has become as far as quality goes the special edition dvd is loaded with tons of extras and well worth it to purchase it as youll have plenty of material to sift through for sure,1
koyaanisquatsi is simply the best film ive ever seen its a masterpiece where everything is at the right place some scenes are not nice or beautiful but the camera never peeks or intrudes this is exactly whats happening here the camera is used to intrude to disgrace and to ridicule there is no magic flow here no sense of greatness or respect instead some scenes are cobbled together without greater purpose or plan the music is disturbing just as i rated koyaanisquatsi the best film ever made this one is the worst its a pure movie too but this is the negative form exactly that which should not be done,0
ive read just about every major book about the manhattan project most people know what it was but few people understand the depth and breadth of the project its scope was immeasurably massive rivaled in us history perhaps only by the space program of the 1960sbr br there were literally millions of people involved from all walks of life at numerous sites most clandestine around the country each involved in a specific and different aspect of the project that they couldnt talk about to the person sitting in the cubicle next to them much less their family the logistics are overwhelming particularly given the considerations of wartime communication security and transportation in the 1940sbr br as an example my colleagues father was a carpenter who worked for one of the companies that had a contract with the federal government for the manhattan project his job was to supervise a crew of about 30 other carpenters who were responsible for manufacturing forms for the pouring of concrete for the massive research installations at hanford washington thats all he did six days a week for nearly two years these carpenters needed food housing sanitary facilities hospitals and materials just as much as did oppenheimer and his crowd at the top of the pyramid just think about it that being said its simply impossible to do the subject justice in a 2hour movie in defense of joffe however i would say that they had an impossible task particularly since he chose to have a diverse screenplay with multiple plots multiple angles and multiple characters what exactly was he thinking and how could he be so arrogant to think that this would work thats hollywood i guessbr br fat man and little boy has so many flaws that it would take a book to list them all horrible casting dreadful and politicallymotivated writing bad science the portrayals of groves and oppie are particularly inaccurate and downright galling notwithstanding the screenplays alltooobvious agenda it is still incredibly bland and sloppybr br these flaws have been listed elsewhere on imdb but i was particularly struck by the fact that the scientists had so much time on their hands softball horseback riding parties semiformal dinners ballet etc not to mention romance and of course circulating political petitions according to fmlb if these great brains had gotten off their duffs and actually spent some time in the lab instead of seducing laura dern we might have won the war before ddaybr br one final gripe fmlb mentions that fat man and little boy were the code names of the two atomic bombs but it doesnt mention that these names were a semigoodnatured jab at groves fat man for heavy stature and oppenheimer little boy for his slight stature another reason paul newman should not have been in this movie,0
based on the memoirs of gypsy rose lee who painted a much more affectionate picture of their mother than did her sister actress baby june havoc in her autobiography early havoc on which they shoot horses dont they was loosely based i saw ethyl merman in the original broadway production of gypsy and she was great as mama rose but certainly more merman than rose i was disappointed with rosalind russells portrayal in the 1962 movie version an otherwise excellent actress russell was a very wooden substitute for merman bette midler by contrast was better and more believable than merman and id recommend her performance as the definitive one,1
gender bender sexes things up a bit for the xfiles this episode has an interesting premise a good story but an ending that is wanting gender bender is also the xfiles debut for actor nicholas lea better known as alex krycek in this episode he plays michael a man attacked by one of the kindred you need to see this episode just to see nic leas less than spectacular beginning an interesting thing about the kindreds power of seduction when marty does it to his victims they become turned onto himher however when andrew seduces scully she only because disoriented and groggy and does not become attracted to andrew maybe its because marty has more experience at it than andrew this episode reminds me of why it would sometimes be miserable to film up in british columbia throughout the episode it is so wet soggy and muddy it could not have been that much fun despite the disappointing ending gender bender is still a decent episode to view,1
i anticipated this movie to be decent and possibly cliché but i was completely wrong charlie cox i had never heard of him until now played an incredibly good leading man he was so earnest and romantic me and my friend that saw the movie with me totally fell in love with himbr br claire danes who i did like before loved her in romeo and juliet made me enjoy her even more her acting was fantastic i couldnt even tell that she was american the chemistry between her and charlie cox was extremely good the casting was quite perfectbr br robert deniro and michelle pfeiffer were equally wellcasted deniro as that gay piratepriceless priceless i laughed so hard at that one scene where septimus comes on the shipoh my god wow pfeiffer played a decent villain i liked her as the snippy mother in hairspray but she had the right amount of melodrama and snide comments throughout the movie br br overall it was funny but not slapstick at all romantic the special effects werent totally frequent but when they were they were great the cameos from ricky gervais and peter otoole were also wellplaced br br i totally recommend this movie to anyone who likes fantasy movies like the princess bride or even lord of the rings it kept my interest the entire time and i will be buying the dvd when it comes out,1
this is one of the better classic edgar wallace movies from the german series it features all basics for a highly enjoyable wallace crime flic movie way back from the 60ies although his majesty mr kinski is missing you still have young joachim blacky fuchsberger starring once again as the typical clever american womanizer you have young eddi arendt in his best and just as well typical role ever the cool sophisticated british butler and you have not so young anymore lowitz as the melancholic yet very dry ironic and thus highly entertaining police investigator furthermore youll get offered a freakish and very campy evil guy behind a frog mask hence the movies title youll get a crazedout swinging soundtrack classic bmovie action scenes partly filmed out off the wildest perspectives please remind the time of its origin yelling scream queens and on and on all those ingredients get shaken well up in a sweet tastin cocktail of pure german edgar wallace campyness highly recommended,1
the other day i showed my boyfriend a great movie stand by me a movie i have shown to many people and they absolutely adored it but for some odd reason he didnt like it he lends me a movie called backdraft and he tells me that hes shown it to many people and they loved it instead i hated this movie i dont think ive hated a movie so much in a while how this movie has even a 66 rating is beyond me i couldnt keep up with the five million stories here billy baldwin becoming a fire man the random sibling rivalry the random love storys the whos being an arson story the investigator the fire who has a personality of its own i just have a problem that this movie cant keep up with all these stories they didnt balance out well enough make the film interesting i would have just preferred if this movie was about being a firefighter or the investigator and how he came to be one or what it is exactly he does and whybr br the movie tells the story of a group of chicago firefighters two brothers stephen bull mccaffrey the elder brother is obsessed with the beating of the fires that he fights brian the younger brother quit the fire fighting academy school several years before then embarking on a number of other unsuccessful careers before returning to become a firefighter he is looked down on by his elder brother who expects him to fail in his newly chosen career as a fire fighter donald shadow rimgale is an arson investigator who is dedicated to his profession he is called in because a number of fires that have occurred have somewhat similar connections martin swayzak is an alderman on the city council he has obvious hopes of being elected to mayor but has had to make a number of budget cuts to the fire department many of the rank and file firemen believe that the cuts that he has made are endangering the lives of the firefighters however swayzak is initially successful in portraying the fire department as bloated and ineffectual after firemen are repeatedly being killed in blazesbr br i just couldnt get into this movie i dont know how anyone else could it was incredibly unrealistic and portrayed firefighters all wrong i loved how they had every action cliché in the book to match this action flick i just felt also like there was great talent wasted on such mediocre roles donald sutherland great actor but such a strange role that could have been taken by a lesser known man who had the upcoming talent at the time i know ron was going for great quality but i think him casting such huge actors in small roles was a mistake for this film i even had to joke my way through while watching this movie commenting how the doctor in the background was probably kevin spacey the fire was so unrealistic and the movie was just so out there,0
paranormal state is an interesting show for most paranormal believers i enjoy watching what the team has to say and what they find however i know that the entire show along with its build ups and story lines are completely set up they go to real haunted locations and i suspect that they speak with actual witnesses i commonly feel as i watch it that i am not watching nonfiction but an actual movie that is contradictory to reality i personally would not advise or recommend anyone to watch this show unless you are a basic scare seeker br br interesting show stick to ghost hunters,0

absolutely wonderful drama and ros is top notchi highly recommend this movie her performance in my opinion was academy award material the only real sad fact here is that universal hasnt seen to it that this movie was ever available on any video format whether it be tape or dvd they are ignoring a very good movie but universal has little regard for its library on dvd which is sad if you get the chance to see this somewhere not sure why it is rarely even run on cable see it i wont go into the story because i think most people would rather have an opinion on the film and too many reviewers spend hours writing about the story which is available anywherebr br a 10,1

let us begin by saying that this films english title the power of kangwon province is an absolute misnomerit is because in hong sang soos filmthere are no actual shots of warstroubles and conflictsso the idea of establishing power of a province is neither suitable nor valid in the context of this filmif we were to judge this film by its korean language titlekangwondo ui him is going to appear as a cryptic statement about emotional turmoils of its young protagonists whose minds are not at resthong sang soo has also directed a highly prolific visual document about erratic choices made by people in their livesthe people in question are a couple of young girls who are constantly in the process of displaying their moodswhims and fancies if making a film out of nothingness can be claimed as a film makers meritorious virtue then hong sang soo has to be saluted as a courageous film maker whose films speak volumes about ubiquitous nothingness of human relationshipssentiments and liveswhether one likes it or notthis is the only fair conclusion that be deduced from this particular film,1
i watched this movie after seeing other comments on imdb even convincing my wife that it was a unique horror movie i wanted to like this movie but was unable tobr br the love story was good but the horror aspect was quite bad if the story was just about a young man who fell in love with a girl suffering from parasomnia then it would have been a better moviebr br the care centre stretched credulity well past the limits in fact it was quite ridiculous the doctor happily ignors privacy laws and professionalism a nurse goes into a room for a routine feeding of a dangerous patient without security escort and drops the tray and runs out of the room screaming for no apparent reason the forensic patient and the films villain is tied up in a standing position fully clothed apparently for years none of it makes much sensebr br the movie even had some actors that ive liked in other things such as the detectives but still i cant recommend this movie,0
yes we all know about dan schneiders odd little fascination with making shows with young kids and icarly is no exception see young girls wiggle their toes and stick their tongues out for the camera and wear skimpy clothes and bikinis yes it makes you wonder if these shows were made for teens or for some older degenerate crowd either way the show isnt that good when compared to dan schneiders other shows like the far superior amanda show drake and joshbr br the show is about a brother and sister carly and spencer living alone and having to get by on their own while their father is off in the army and their mother is strangely absent from their lives carly has a mean spirited friend named sam and they do a very well produced award winning web show called icarly with their little school friend freddie the episodes deal with their lives in and around the web show and their hi jinx at schoolbr br carly shay is a young all knowing web personality business woman producer played by miranda cosgrove a young actress who relies on talking very very loudly and fast to get her point across and making odd faces her brother spencer is a somewhat meanspirited dimwit and eccentric artist played by jerry trainor who tries a bit to hard to be like jim carrey and whose comedy style seems to be aimed at the young male audience whod like this type of joey gladstone humor then theres sam puckett an unlikable mean little lying thief of a brat who needs an attitude adjustment played by jeanette mccurdy who clearly wears hair extensions as you can see them disappear then reappear from scene to scene and finally theres freddie benson the web shows nerdy cameraman and technical adviser who has a major crush on carly but will obviously get nowhere with her whos played by nathan kressbr br other secondary characters come and go such as freddies mother carlys grandfather annoying teachers and many of their annoying little school friends to round out the cast most of the comedy is mean spirited like blowing up lewbert the doorman as a gag throwing a water balloon at a teacher and knocking over the table of young girl scouts selling cookies all of the adults come off as complete idiots while the children are all knowing and certain main characters have absolutely no morals lying cheating stealing and violence all are acceptable in this childrens show created and written by dan schneider yes its a childrens show what more could the young viewers ask for well with dan schneider we can expect to have the young girls dress in tight clothes and bikinis and do some odd things like sticking their tongues out for the camera and eating bananasbr br shows like this are just what the young crowd likes though and i guess no worse then any of the other garbage nick shovels at its young crowd theres always fans to be found for anything seen on tv,0
it is fascinating how this title manages to slip by the average viewer as something new and groundbreaking quoting some of the comments murali k thalluri must have thought by himself oh great elephant what a fantastic movie ill try hard to do exactly the same movie and see if anyone notices sadly enough he even failed with his outrageous idea the movie turns out a complete failure considering that it tries hard to catch the brilliance of gus van sants elephant it makes it look even more ridiculous a most embarrassing faux pas for a film directorbr br the movie starts off with the suicide of a student in the schools bathroom this scene already shows the awkward acting skills of each one involved in this scene you dont buy a single word they say in carries on interrupted by short interviewstyled bits of the kids who live on their marry lives with each bit rather distressing in its plain stupidity on the basis of each worthless monologue thalluri means to introduce the characters this way to give a kind of fastasjunkfood insight look into their hearts and fails once again not five minutes later thalluri ultimately screams at the audience yes people i stole this movie and for some curious reason i am proud of it by taking gus van sants most unmistakable narrative style from elephant he shot scenes twice to let the viewer follow each character involved in a scene on his particular way and role in a school situation hm doesnt this seem awfully familiar to me this certain level of very forgiving tolerance had been infringed right there to a point at which i couldnt stand this dreadful movie any more shame on you murali k thalluri i say i am especially surprised that 237 has reached the official selections in cannes as of 2006 whereas everyone must have certainly remembered elephant 2003 at the very same film festival just a few years ago so how in the name of the lord did this most disgraceful ripoff end up being shown there i find myself absolutely puzzled by this mistakebr br directors like thalluri use the ignorance of audiences who arent and cannot completely be aware of every independent film out there as elephant has little to do with mainstream cinema although it is without a doubt a masterpiece few people notice that the story as told in 237 had been told before how that is possible at a film festival of such importance as attributed to cannes i cannot say it is sad and shameful that such things are passed on and hardly anyone sees the true fraud in itbr br 237 is by all means solely commercial worthless as an independent film and on a certain level rather a phoney parody of its obvious idol elephant,0
the sounds in the movie were so mundane and ridiculous seriously banging on the door hinges for about 30 minutes really crunches your teeth and makes your head hurtbr br i love bad puns more than the next guy but come on no blood on our hands being said about a million times by matt dillon character and when matt dillons character shoots the bum the lead character which i fail to remember his name because i dont really think anyone cares gets blood on his hands literallybr br the background music with the heavy metal guitar ringing an achord for about 5 minutes isnt my idea of music come on i was having the worst headache by the end of this garbage,0
with this topic it is so easy to take cheap shots you know the guy with hairy legs trying to look like marilyn monroe not here adrian pasdar does a superb job of making gerald a real person someone you care deeply about and as a result you feel for his plight trying to live both as gerald and geraldine not only that but as geraldine he looks hot and the chemistry between him and julie walters is electric these are two characters who feel love for one another and it comes through even when they simply look at each other over the breakfast table even the potentially cheesy substory line of corporate takeovers is believable and you find yourself cheering at the end at least i did,1
although the movie takes place at an ivy league college it was in fact shot entirely in northern arizona mostly at northern arizona university in flagstaff in the fall of 1976 i was involved in the theater department there and most of the extras in the film are thenmembers of the theater department br br there is an absolutely ludicrous scene in this film if you know your arizona geography that shows several cast members riding bikes from the college to a creek we nauers know that the campus and said creek actually oak creek canyon are about 35 miles apart and while the trip there is all downhill it would be literally impossible to ride a bike back up that same road,0
i saw two movies over the weekend one was kaal and the other waqt both movies are made in bollywood but they are worlds apart the fundamental difference is the story and the director vipul shaw made his indelible mark with ankhen one of the best comedy hindi movies his casting of the charecteres is perfect the story apparently taken from a gujerati play is awesomethe treatment is superb with some exceptions in bollywood when a movie is put together the first thing a bollywood director is prone to do is sign up a music director and this guy mediocre malik in this instanceis obligated to drum up six songs to fulfill his contract so even a good director like vipul shah has to use them to appease the finacier and the grandmas who just cant get enough of these numbers no music director can churn out good songs relentlessly as clearly evident in this movie none of the songs have any melody and they are clearly intrusive to the narration of the story except the background music and the westernized version of the bharatnatyam the duelling and role playing the father and son is good acting by bachachan and akshay kumar his stunt scenes are clearly outstanding a good director surrounds himself with good actors and he is willing to wait till a good story comes along as in this super movie then we have a cheap classless tasteless producer like sharukh khan who will stoop low as to shamelessly plug and promote a trash like kaal to enrich himself at the cost of the betterment of art and they surround themselves with borderline talent and they recoup the investment before the word gets around these are the bollywood locusts who prey on the unsuspected audience to garner film farce awards given by bollywood chamchas and most of them are in the media,1
the movie is pretty funny and involving for about four dates then it becomes a blatant commercial for some guy you and even his friends really cant stand it is a pretty interesting concept film dates on a quest to find true love in modern la the problem is that it feels incredibly and badly scripted at times and blatantly selfpromoting it is difficult to care about and be drawn into any of the characters because the writeractor is so egotistical uncool untrue and simply unlikeable you end up feeling sorry for his dates,0
my first question is not about the horrible acting not about the horrendous writing it is the directing the choices that were made about the cinematography are some of this worst decisions i have ever seen why does every single bad guy have to die in slow motion i was about to beat myself with a rubber hose the camera shots make it so that you cant see whats going on i was just about to turn the movie off because of jalal merhis accent when it made it to the sex scene so i thought it might get better well it did not if you rate special effects on an abc rating scale i would have to put it around a w or so and did i mention the acting wow was it bad and the worst part of the entire expect to die experience is the blatant misuse of the phrase on the cover which is the matrix just got deadlier comparing this movie to the matrix is easily the worst comparison i have ever seen if you havent seen this movie dont unless you are looking for a good reason to beat your head against the wall,0
i saw this hot movie when it came out in 1986 it had a x rating for a brief scene involving oral sex but played in mainstream theatres it was an art film supposedly its the first film to ever show a respected actress in an explicit sex scenebr br what i saw was a boring tale about a high school boy federico pitzalis in love understandably with an older woman maruschka detmers as has been mentioned before detmers is very beautiful with a good body but she also gave a very good performance pitzalis was to put it mildly pretty poor its no wonder he never made another movie still despite the infamous sex scene which is explicit but pretty brief this a slow moving dull story which bored me silly the good acting by detmers only helped to a certain point mostly i was looking at my watch waiting patiently for it to end if it didnt have that sequence this movie would have been forgotten long ago dull and slow you can skip this one,0
jewel thief is the crime thriller of bollywood and why should it not be it is directed by the biggest exponent of the crime thriller art in indian cinema vijay anand johny mera naam and teesri manzil i could watch this movie for any of the following reasons in order of importancebr br 1 vijay anands direction 2 r d burmans music 3 dev anand 4 vyjayanthimala 5 ashok kumar 6 majrooh sultanpuris lyricsbr br even if jewel thief is not a bond movie it definitely has bond babes helen tanuja and the mysterious vyajanthimala and some cameos but our sauvé vinay dev anand is anything but bond he is out of control for most of the story and goes where the story takes him almost always as confused as we are he even flirts with anju tanuja trying to hit her romantic nerve just so that he can get employed in her fathers shopbr br dev anand might be in a double role well i dont want to spoil your movie or else i would have told you that is what most of the mystery is about dev anand works in a jewelry shop and there is a robbery when he is supposed to be at work though is not or at least has a perfect alibi we wonder who did it is it dev anand as vijay the person he claims to be or is it amar someone we have not yet seen but many people claim is his look alike comes shalu vyjayanthimala who even claims that he is her fiancé in a tense situation dev anand has to prove that he is vinay and not amar while everyone wonders if dev anand is vinay or amar he is asked to remove his socks amar we are told has 6 digits on one of his foot while we watch with bated breath the events that are about to unfold dev anand even finds time to joke br br the real life brothers director vijay anand and actor dev anand have many movies between them this is not the best of them but definitely the best in crime thriller br br there are moments of hitchcocks north by northwest but the movies are very different except for the confusion about who is who a treacherous female lead and lot of traveling there isnt a lot of similarity dev anand could very well be amar in addition to being vijay people have seen him they identify him where ever he goes there are too many of those people for this to be a fraud finally vinay thinks it is better to carry along with being amar to find out what is the truth and it is a sad mistake he gets too deep into it only to be saved by the twists of cinemabr br when i watched the movie as a kid i was definitely not amused the ending confused me completely even now there are parts about the ending that i do not like but id recommend this movie,1
mild spoilers belowbr br the prospect of war was clearly on the horizon when tfw was filmed from the opening scene of european refugees to the final prediction that naziism will be the death of millions of germans this movie is as much a propaganda film as the films made after pearl harbor there isnt a lot of entertainment value here though the footage of the dust bowl is interesting to those of us who arent old enough to remember it the rest of the plot is pretty forgettable with the herr docktor coburn with a pretty bad accent and daughter assimilating into america with waynes help other than the dust bowl scenes the only memorable aspect of the movie is one best viewed with hindsight coburns speech comparing naziism to a malignancy worse than cancer and describing the then current successes as a momentary outburst of energy from a patient right before death were eerily accurate and varnos dr scherer played accurately to post war newsreel footage of unrepentant nazis justifying their actionsbr br when viewed from a historical perspective some aspects of tfw are interesting if you look at it for entertainment outside of the wwii perspective youd have to say this is one of waynes less successful efforts,0
a very gritty gutsy portrayal of a part of world war 2 history that most of us in the us hadhave no idea ever occurred i would love to have this on video it only was shown on tv one time as far as i know back in 89or 90 i have asked around for this movie and most video stores dont even know about it great actresses all around wish that i could see it again top notch series,1

i go to the cinema to be entertained there is absolutely nothing entertaining about this film from beginning to end there is no respite from the gray grinding reality of this womans life it is onepaced with no change of mood i remained until the end only because i was convinced that things must get better they dont and i dont think i was the only one as evidenced by the many groans ringing around the cinema as the film drew mercifully to a close honestly depicting social depravation is no crime but boring your audience to groans is not the way to win the sympathy of the public a dreadful film,0

this movie was slower then molasses in january in alaska the man who put togeather the preview should get an award for managing to put every one of the 30 seconds that were interisting into the preview i had to wake up the people i was watching it with several times after it was over i felt bad for having woken them up br br most of the film is taken up with hoping something will actually happen but nothing ever does it was easy to loose track of peoples motives and the characters were flat and uninteristing by the end of the movie you just hoped everyone would died everyone runs around either being contemptible petty or pitiful and usually all three br br and worse we watched a minute or two of the added features just for kicks and giggles you understand and all that we saw was people being smug about how socially aware they are if they had spend the time on the movie that they did patting themselves on the back it might have been worth watching br br i was brought in expecting the excitement of 24 i got a lecture on social awareness through the blery eyes of the sandman,0
as with many other popculture franchise series this line just didnt know when to quit instead of leaving things as they were perfectly ended they went on to generate this the first installment of this franchise to fall sorely short of the markbr br this movie should never have happened it was not intended for there to have been a fourth movie in this line and it sure shows the premise is idiotic and the portrayals were the samebr br after the wonderful experience which was the omen this was a major disappointment which stank of 70s cheese and horrible acting it was reminiscent of the amityville horror in those aspects and left a terrible lingering stench long after it was over br br it rates a 1410 frombr br the fiend,0
national treasure 2004 is a thoroughly misguided hodgepodge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy cliché that has ever been written the film stars nicholas cage as benjamin franklin gates how precious is that i ask you a seemingly normal fellow who for no other reason than being of a lineage of likeminded misguided fortune hunters decides to steal a national treasure that has been hidden by the united states founding fathers after a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably unintentionally like indiana jones meets the patriot the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another attempting to create a stanley goodspeed regurgitation of nicholas cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane but disconnected misadventuresbr br the relevancy and logic to having george washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a kings ransom someplace on native soil and then going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout us currency art work is something that director jon turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining couldnt washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country hence we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth bens intentions are noble if confusing hes set on protecting the treasure for who and when your guess is as good as minebr br but there are a few problems with bens crusade first up his friend ian holmes sean bean decides that he cant wait for ben to make up his mind about stealing the declaration of independence from the national archives oh yeah brilliant idea presumably the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune so ian tries to kill ben the assassination attempt is of course unsuccessful if overly melodramatic it also affords ben the opportunity to pick up and pick on the very sultry curator of the archives abigail chase diane kruger she thinks ben is clearly a nut at least at the beginning but true to actionromance form abbys resolve melts quicker than you can say is that the hope diamond the film moves into full xfileish mode as the fbi mistakenly believing that ben is behind the theft retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multilayering of action sequences reminiscent of mission impossible meets the fugitive honestly dont those guys ever get intelligence information that is correct in the final analysis national treasure isnt great film making so much as its a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies woven together from scraps the likes of which would make il betsy ross blushbr br the buena vista dvd delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of the anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors natural flesh tones solid blacks and clean whites the stylized image is also,0
this is simply another bad chuck norris movie norris plays a cop on the trail of a twisted serial killer of women he put the guy away three years before but the guy somehow gets through the bars in the nut house hes in by using what looks like dental floss then the killer escapes in a cleaning van and drives it over a 400 foot cliff and survives to spend time around a theater undergoing renovation irish jack ohalloran is the best thing in this movie but like in superman ii he doesnt say a word somehow thats supposed to make him more menacing ron oneal of super fly fame and steve james are wasted playing the citys mayor and norris sidekick respectively the film also contains the idiotic subplot of norris and his girlfriend having a child out of wedlock its so 1980s when coupling norris serious acting turn with overthetop musical cues signaling every forthcoming scene in predictable fashion the film becomes a chore to sit through the buildup while searching for the killer in the theater is interesting enough with norris crawling through the shadows to discover the hideaway but the end fight is disappointing after beginning in such a promising way its yet another disappointment from cannon films and it plays like a movie made for television of 4 stars,0
i liked this movie thats pretty much all i can say about it lou gossett did a good job even though im still very disappointed in him after all the iron eagle movies and even if i was smiling on the inside when the first main teenager dies i wont give it away it was done in a nice fitting fashion pretty much everyone in this movie does a good job so check it out its another one of those movies i found real cheap so i bought it and i recommend the same,1
i really dont understand all these positive user reviews this movie is the worst movie ive ever seen and im not trying to be pessimisticbr br eva mendez is hot but terrible in this film but i dont think it is her own fault but the directors he have somehow managed to make everything look artificial their acting the idea the makeup everythingbr br the star im giving is only for the idea behind the movie which was very bad executedbr br dont watch this bullshit go watch a fellini woody allen or some david lynch,0
nicole eggert was listed as the star of this despite micheal dorn stacey keach being much bigger stars than herbr br basically this is a bit of a spin on the alien lands on earth film eggert plays the girl who feels sorry for an alien being chased by the military and takes in the runaway creature in her very sexy disguise a bit of nudity and partial nudity a pointless sex scene all feature along the waybr br the film stumbles through a few obvious setpieces and running jokes about being shown photographs i quite liked the star trek jokes when micheal dorn had been taken over and he got a really cool death scenebr br it was fairly obvious that stacey keach was going to be taken over and the film had quite a weak ending it would have been nice to show exactly what kind of talent the alien passed to eggert,0
welcome back kiefer sutherland its been too long since youve appeared in a movie and what a movie this was was it 24 no but very intriguing especially with a pro like michael douglas in the lead as the embattled secret service agent kiefers character is the one chasing michael douglas the whole movie kiefers partner is eva longoria the desperate houswife wow she can actually act besides flirt all day and look good i wish though that kim bassinger had a bigger role but other than that i really think the whole movie was a blast from start to finish this movie is what i consider to b e a political thriller everybody played their part to the hilt nothing was revealed to sooon in the movie so as to keep you guessing at all times and i really think that kiefer did one heck of a job here in this movie but in my opinion michael douglas had the besxt performance of the day thumbs up,1
my husband and i watched this last nightit was wonderfulfor once he was wrong in guessing ahead of time the suspenseful ending it moved along very quickly and the acting was superb i adore tom wilkinson anyway he has never made a bad movie as far as im concerned the above description of his acting hits the nail on the head the facial expressions are incredible even the picturesque scenery is awesome we have just finished watched all of the prime suspect series and i am convinced that the british have a way of capturing the audience there is no doubt that i would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to get a few hours of thorough entertainment,1
i was drawn to this movie the moment i saw a preview of it on oscar night when i read about kay pollak i was hooked we americans are suckers for a comeback kidbr br i understand this movie was a huge draw in sweden as a very provincial american i can only speculate on the reason perhaps it is because of the provocative joke that the lena character makes at the beginning of the movie and other social comment but perhaps it is because of the central message which i believe has the same appeal everywhere in affluent societiesbr br the message of this movie for me is the same as the movie titanic life is short people and as far as anyone really knows its all weve got it can be taken away at any time so isnt it a pity that we spend so much time hiding behind walls separating us from other people because were so afraid of being hurt tearing down the walls is painful but feeling alive lies on the other side of those wretched walls feeling alive is worth taking the risk give and you will receive so start living nowbr br many people are criticizing this movie for its lack of characterization and other flaws i say you are all pseudosophisticated get a grip folks its a parable a fable for we affluent westerners who are materially rich but whose souls are in abject povertybr br so join a choir or a band or help build housing or distribute food for those less fortunate than you spread some joy and make the world a better place as long as you get out and commune with your fellow man writing a check is not enough we are a social species by the way even the humblest of your fellow human beings can affect you in ways you never thought possiblebr br rugged individualism has its place but it is overrated,1
having spent the six years previous writing and producing luc besson returns to the directors chair with angela im a huge fan of léon and quite liked the prospect of a black and white french film from the same chapbr br andré is a liar and gambling addict owing money to almost every loan shark in paris unable to repay his debts and fed up with being held over the edge of the eiffel tower he decides to kill himself he happens to do so at the same time as a mysterious woman who he decides to save determined to thank him she begins to help him fix his own lifebr br the film starts with some laughs which run well throughout the visuals are quite nice and work well with the sights of paris but that is it thats all the film has got going for it and these mere two facets can do nothing to hold back the torrent of terrible filmmaking the movie unleashes though i cant hugely fault the main character his inconsistencies are close though the eponymous one is ghastly a terrible screen presence and bitterly annoying the plot is ridiculously inconsistent itself and at times bizarrely silly particularly the ending an ending which completely bloodied the fledgling redemption engendered by the scenes immediately prior to it perhaps the most ridiculous scene ive had the ignominy of observing it is stupid indulgent melodramatic and considerably too awful to be so bad its funny the overall premise of the film could conceivably have once held potential but it is brutally massacred by the unendingly terrible implementation of its ideas the film really was a task to watch and one which had me screaming at the screen the whole way throughbr br massively and immeasurably flawed angela is just plain bad though its occasionally fun dialogue manages to draw out chortles at rare intervals by the end it is clear that this film is nothing more than repugnant,0
enjoyed this 1936 film with plenty of veteran classic actors and especially william powell dr lawrence bradford mister roberts who played the role as a doctor and detective dr bradford was once married to jean arthur paula bradford shane and got a divorce and still they managed to live with each other and also fight all the time paula wanted her husband to investigate a homicide and did everything she could to convince him it was very important jean arthur plays a rather nutty type and there is plenty of 1936 comedy and the method of murder is something you will never believe especially with a jockey on a california race track robert armstrong nick martel king kong gave a great supporting role as a bookie along with james gleason a detective who need the help of dr bradford in order to solve this very strange murder mystery if you see this film just remember it was produced and directed in 1936 and the people in the audience in those days thought this was great entertainment and it really was in those days,1
reed hadley makes a better foppish don diego than he does a dashing and daring zorro but thats almost beside the point because this serial features the barnone best theme song of any serial ever and the best version of yakima canutts famous stagecoach stunt there are other good stunts and lots of action and plenty of hairraising cliffhanger chapter endings but if for no other reason you must see this film to watch the stagecoach stunt then rewatch it in slow motion it is incredible and despite the lower budget for this chapter play yak turns in a better take on the stunt here than he did in the far more celebrated film stagecoach indiana jones eat your heart out this is the real deal,1
anna christie 1930br br anna christie has some terrific parts and some amazing performances and yet it should be even better than it is it has drama some of the scenes are really atmospheric and if the interior shots around the table are a bore other shots at night and at sea are really pretty exciting then there are the nearly historical lively scenes set in coney island even a brief jittery roller coaster ride and the episode where two women are behind a netting in separate beds and visitors to the midway can throw balls to try to tip them over and the women scantily dressed egg the men on is weirdly sexual comeon kind of way all the while garbo at the front of the crowd watchesbr br garbo of course is what makes this movie more than just another very good early talkie she plays all sides of her character she is coy and skeptical and in some kind of inner anguish she laughs and cries withdraws and pushes outward in some ways its a forward looking remarkable movie directed by clarence brown who has a whole series of significant films from this precode sound erabr br though based on a successful eugene oneil play its the writing that struggles a little as the actors seem to go through the paces at times marie dressler is great in that exaggerated way she almost trademarked and then there is greta garbo who really does have a natural presence even if it seems shes overacting just slightly at times but then so is everyone else garbo is of course famous first as a silent actress and this is her talking film debut audiences loved her enough that she made a german language version the following year,1

when you start watching this animationmasterpiece you quickly notice that its a european production although the europeans have sadly integrated some of the clichés you would normally find in an american production of this kind most are missing one of these is that there is an overwhelming evil that only our very few and very unlikely heroes can vanquish another is that one of the group is only in the business for the money is greedy runs away when the heat is up but somehow gives in to his better nature this movie would have been better off without bothbr br the movie is based upon a tvseries that was out four years before the movie unlike the movie the tvseries is a cartoon and not a computer animation at first i thought the computer would kill the charm and character of the plot but i was quickliy convinced whoever did the animation knew his or her stuff although the characters are obviously fictional in stills they dont even look real they seem as alive and sentient as the audience following their quest making characters who by normal standards could be considered deformed those microlegs could never carry that giant body let alone make it jump so alive and lovable is more than just a highlight the creation of the world is another masterpiece not so much because of its looks but because of the inventiveness of it the world our heroes travel is not solid like our own but is made of many pieces of land varying in shape and size that seem to be floating in mid air when a person steps on a smaller fragment of ground it nods a little bit as if feathering from the weight in some cases up and down no longer apply but our heroes still manage to get a foothold somewhere although the world of floating islands is completely surreal in this movie it is absolutely believable and after a short time it doesnt seem any weirder than running into a car somewhere in new yorkbr br i wrote that the looks of the world arent as breathtaking as the idea as true as that might be to my mind the quality of the world the characters and the attention to details is staggering although the faces of the characters have relatively few attributes emotions can be read as clearly as in sean connerys or dustin hoffmans face the world around the characters is wonderfully colourful and no two settings are alike the background is always in motion something is always going on which makes the world seem even more alive if you stop the movie and look at the background you will be surprised how many details you can findbr br the existence of hector actually puts the cherry on top hector is a furry little thing possibly the equivalent of a dog in our world who is totally lovable and extremely funny although he isnt really important for the main plot he would be missed like scrat would be in ice,1

kings and queen is a bloated french drama that rambles on for an interminable two hours and thirtytwo minutes to no discernible point or purposebr br the film features two stories that seem unrelated at first but which eventually connect with one another about halfway through the movie the first centers around nora and her struggles with various men in her life including an elderly father who discovers he has only a few days left to live the other story involves a young man named ismael a violinist who finds himself placed unfairly he believes in a mental institution through the machinations of an unknown third party after traveling along on separate tracks for awhile these two narrative strands eventually come together when we learn that ismael is a former lover of noras and the man she has chosen to adopt her son from an earlier tragic relationshipbr br with a bit more focus and a considerable amount of streamlining kings and queen might have been a potent engrossing drama about modern day relationships it certainly has moments of tremendous insight and emotional power and the performances are for the most part complex and touching but taken as a whole the film meanders and maunders to such an extent that quite frankly it begins to wreak havoc on our patience and to wear out its welcome early on even more distressing is the fact that even though we spend what seems like a mild eternity in the company of these people we really dont know quite what to make of any of them when the show is finally over for instance noras father on his deathbed writes a withering diatribe against his daughters character that simply doesnt gibe with the woman weve been looking at for well over two hours nora is admittedly no mother theresa then again who is but she certainly doesnt deserve the invective thrown at her by her very own father nora could be accused of being confused indecisive a bit selfabsorbed at times but evil enough to have her father wishing he could give her his cancer and make her die in his place i dont think sobr br perhaps this film is simply operating at a level of depth that i was unable to fathom but my suspicion is that even writer roger bohbot and cowriterdirector arnaud desplechin would have trouble fully explaining their purpose here this is a well acted pretentious bore of a film that takes the viewer on a long rambling voyage through a sea of personal crises a journey that leaves him no wiser or more enlightened at the end than he was at the beginning,0

wow fantastic film in my opinion i wasnt expecting it to be this good i was captivated from start to finish its a very well made and educational film that really gives us a fascinating insight into the trials darwin had to go through in order to convey his ideas to the world chronicling his life as he writes origin of the species fighting both personal demons as well as the ignorant society of the time in order to do so he struggles hard with his mind body and soul as personal matters get to breaking point and even his family seems to slip awaywhilst the rest of the world stand against him as he knows that his findings literally shake the very foundations of their lives culture and meaning of existence its a subtle movie not overexaggerated in any way in that typical hollywood way this is a bbc produced british film yet thankfully very powerful in meaning and this is thanks to the amazing well directed scenes as well as the superb acting by bettany connelly acts as more of a light supporting role but i did enjoy her in this and shes as good as to be expected as always her chemistry alongside her husband was definitely strong and endearing you could feel the connection and their reallife husbandwife bond definitely shines through their performances but the star of the show is definitely bettany and he does a brilliant job a very touching performance i both understood and sympathised with him as he battled his own degrading health and impending insanity to try to understand what he has uncovered and come to terms with what it all really is and means as he found his thinking contradict his feelings and found himself losing it all including his wife who of course was a firm believer in religion and a strict christian whilst he was in the realm of science two worlds which could not see eye to eye so their relationship was at stake toobr br anyway a really very good well acted emotional drama and dare i say i did shed a tear during the tragic climax which was truly heartbreaking as well as beautifully poignant and moving the film is symbolic and very intellectually artistic as well in fact i cant wait to watch it again as there was a lot to take in first time round which i missed easily one of the best films ive seen this year,1
the movie is basically the story of a russian prostitutes return to her home village for the funeral of a sisterfriend there are a couple of other minor story lines that might actually be more interesting than the one taken but they are not fully explored the core of the movie is the funeral wake and later controversy over the future of a community of crones that make dolls and sell them to buy vodka but are now missing the artist who made their dolls marketable apparently the movie is unedited the prostitutes journey from the city to the village is an excruciatingly endless train ride and tramp through the mud maybe thats supposed to impress us with the immensity of the russian landscape the village itself such as it is is inhabited by a legion of widows and one male the consort of the dead girl continuing the doll business is problematic for everyone involved and eventually seems impossible most of the film is shot with a handheld camera that could induce nausea another problem for western viewers is that subtitles dont include the songs and laments of the crones dont go to this movie unless youre fluent in russian,0
first i must point out that the role wendell corey played was exceptional usually corey was relegated to supporting roles but here he is what helps carry this very limp film without him and the character he played the film would have been a lot worsehardly meriting a 2 or 3br br so why did i hate the rest of the film so much well one of my pet peeves is when characters act too stupid to live you cant base major plot points on the assumption that your major characters are completely stupid unless having a brain injury is part of the plot of course but this is exactly what happens in this film wendell corey is a crazed man who has murdered three innocent people and they know his next target is joseph cottens wife so what do they do yep they provide really inadequate police protection and a plan that makes no sense at all no marksman and guys with shotguns that are so far away they probably wont stop this madman and if this isnt bad enough the marked woman inexplicably runs away from her hiding place and walks right into the worst possible place she could be is anyone that stupid arrrggghhhhi hate when movies have such dumb characters in fact i found myself rooting for corey since i felt the idiots deserved to die for their behaviors in addition to these clichéd characters there was also a bit player who fainted sure seeing your husband shot might cause someone to faint however in real life this is a rare occurrencepeople rarely faint unless there is a medical reason so combining this with the above character problems is a real nightmare for people who are looking for realismsomething film noir movies must havebr br all these serious problems are even more infuriating since wendell coreys character is amazingly wellwritten and conceived it was his chance to shine as an actortoo bad the rest of the movie was so limp that corey and the basic plot idea are sunk this is one film that could really use a remakebut this time without brainless characters,0
this is a very intriguing short movie by david lynch and saying the name david lynch is probably enough for a lot of people this is your typical lynch short a blonde and a brunette are in a dark room the blonde has been crying the brunette is talking in a threatening way to the blonde and thats about itbr br with a lot of silent moments but with the haunting music from angelo badalamenti there is a strange form of suspense this short feels a little like mulholland dr a movie i loved and therefore i liked this one as well it is probably especially for lynch fans but there is a chance you like this,1
even steve martin and dan aykroyd couldnt save this movie from laying an emusized egg based on the classic phil silvers tv series it bombed because a it was updated to the 1990s and b the simple premise of the tv series was turned into a confusing feeble and silly screenplaybr br the original tv series used a small cast of talented actors to portray lovable characters acting out simple yet hilarious pranks to expand this premise into a 1990s movie was asking for trouble and it shows no one could pay me enough to sit through this stinker a second time,0
less than 10 minutes into this film i wanted it to end as it was painful all this horror movie was about was a group of whiny bitches doing stupid things for 90 minutes arguing crying and screaming do not let the positive reviews fool you as this really is a terrible movie and you really shouldnt watch itbr br the movies plot had potential to be something great but it just doesnt happen a group of five teenage girls are driving home one night when they find themselves being pursued by a crazed female driver who wants to kill them two minutes into the movie and the characters are already arguing and this doesnt stop all we have for 90 minutes is a bunch of girls whining crying screaming acting and arguing none of the dialogue is even remotely interesting too so you dont get to really know these characters or enjoy thembr br the acting was terrible and i was shocked to find out that these characters were meant to be teenagers none of these women looked a day under 20 and one of them easily looked like she was nearly 30 years old at least get people who look the age none of them gave even remotely decent performances and just seemed like they were picked off the street or were friends of the director with no acting abilities the actress who played the killer overdone it but she at least showed something that the other girls didnt a little bit of talentbr br the characters dont help things because these girls are a bunch of whiny stupid bitches that is all i can really say about them and it did not help that they all survived if i have to go into detail in one scene the girls are being chased by the killer and having their car knocked a lot one girl injures herself and is whining about itfour of them arent wearing seatbeltswhat do you expect one of your friends is being brutally attacked by the killerand you all just happen to be conveniently too hurt to help whateverbr br the filming of the movie is absolutely terrible i dont care if this movie had a budget the size of a peanut the filming was terrible and it was like watching a pirated version of a movie the cameraman was clearly in the car with the girls pushed up against a window somewhere and the amount of times the camera blurred out shook and brushed up against an actress was horrendous it was also grainy and at times you couldnt hear what characters were saying not that it was anything worth listening tobr br supposedly the killers car in the movie that supposedly got hit even though we only heard the accident is actually the directors car in real life no wonder they didnt show the car getting hit this movie is so cheap they cant even show a car getting a little scratched up oh gotta mention the soundtrack alsoif thats what it was it,0
wheres michael caine when you need him ive seen most of the many seasons of mst3k but this rare pre1st season flick episdoe k20 is easily one of the worst movies ever made three stars lee majors chris makepeace and burgess meredith struggle through the worst batch of cinematography ever delivering lines which must have been written by a secret dick cheneystyle workgroup composed of exxon and gm lawyers trying to cut funding for mass transit and energy efficiency research looks like it was filmed in almost total darkness possibly on super 8 makes logans run look like the cinematic sistine chapel crossed with shakespeare i cant imagine watching it without the commentary of crow and servo since its unwatchable even with it clearly whats needed in hollywood is some sort of 401k which prevents the need for actors to take on bad movies like this in order to pay for their health care with its rights to pollute and drive theme by the end im half expecting to see a charlton heston cameo where he delivers his cold dead hands speech lee i could have forgiven you for this in 1989 but 1981,0
this is the kind of film that i am wondering why anybody would have considered doing it from the beginning this is the kind of movie that i cannot understand how people put money in it how the rental store can put the dvd on its shelves this is the kind of movie i blame myself for having rented it br br there are good classb movies and i do not reject the genre when they are good they catch the interest with the action they have characters written well enough and acted well enough so that you can care about them the effects in some of these movies support the film in many cases and you may like them for the originality almost nothing is true in coronado the subject and the script is at the level of cheap comics just a cliche the effects are cheap and i do not care that the film is low budget you can do a lot with low budget but you need some talent there are so many continuity and other directing errors as in ten other films you do not care for the characters you do not laugh and at the end of the film you are left wondering if the parody was intentional or not the only quality i could find is the scenery there are some good locations worth a much better film br br 210 on my personal scale the worst film of the year so far,0

heavily reedited and often confusing the original screen version of man on fire was at least ten years out of date when it was made and the passing years havent made it any better this is the kind of movie that producers with too much money and too little experience make to get attention and everyone else does just to pay off their outstanding alimony or their drug dealer with scott glenns bodyguard going out on a limb to rescue his 12yearold charge the kidnapped daughter of a wealthy italian family an interesting cast joe pesci brooke adams danny aiello jonathan pryce have all done better the action is sluggish and sparse and only john scotts exceptionally fine score part of which turned up in the last reel of die hard makes a positive impression one case where the remake made by tony scott the original choice of director for this version is an improvement,0
reading my review of the house that screamed many may assume that im some 14 year old who thinks scream is considered classic horror this is not the case as im 30 years old and have been watching horror films for most of my life but admittedly im a child of the 80s that grew up on slasherzombieghostcannibal etctypes of horror films so i do typically prefer horror films that are more graphic and fasterpaced just like someone who can appreciate different music painting or in this case film but not necessarily like them i can appreciate why some people may enjoy this sort of filmi just dontbr br the house that screamed is an exceedingly dull and tedious film about a school for wayward girls the heavyhanded mistress of the school rules with an iron hand or whip in some cases to keep the girls in line she has a young son who creeps around and peeps on the girls while they shower in their nightgowns no less and meanwhile girls are disappearing from the school as they are the victim of a murderer whos lurking about the campusbr br i can see why the house that screamed is often compared to suspiria which is a masterpiece of a film in my opinion in terms of the atmosphere of the school itself and the interaction between the girls and their guardians but this film is so dull and uneventful that i could barely stay awake im all for tension and suspense in horror films but this film held neither for me luckily i wasnt expecting a whole lot going into this one so i cant say i was really disappointed the house that screamed just reinforced the fact that i personally dont typically enjoy most horror films much older than from the 70s this isnt a hard and fast rule but those that i have enjoyed definitely seem to be more of the exception probably a mustsee for horror fans who enjoy more understated and suggestive horror films but as i dont really know too many fans of that sort of material i cant really recommend this one410,0
if one overlooks the technical problems of this early 1930 sound movie such as the sound quality and the occasional stiffness of john wayne one will find this movie to be an epic that is more realistic than almost any movie made since beginning at the missouri a large caravan of conestoga wagons people and animals head west the wagons are pulled down huge cliffs and cross a flooded river with considerable risk to the riders in the wagons indians meet with wayne and allow the train to pass through their land later indians gather west of the train to combat them the wagons form a huge circle with horses and cattle in the circle and fire their rifles creating with the circling indians a veil of smokebr br when the battle ends the dead are buried on the spot and the people and wagons depart this scene is remarkable as the camera stays with the dead as the living depart it is unique in the way it links the viewer with the dead and separates the viewer from the living the wagons encounter a major thunderstorm with torrential downpours and mud everywhere they finally arrive at their destination near a redwood or sequoia forest in oregon the film is done in 70 mm widescreen at about a 201 ratio in 1930br br i havent mentioned the plot because it is secondary to the scenic grandeur and the enormous amount of work involved in making this film moviemakers will never work this hard again to make such a movie or any movie given the technical limitations of the sound the music is at times moving such as when wayne leaves his girl to hunt down his friends killers and at the endbr br while all the critics rave about the searchers and waynes psychology racism short temper and complex characters the big trail gives us a story of simple people encountering extraordinary hardships one of the best westerns i have seen,1
its interesting to watch how late 1950s society is depicted in this film men are lecherous chainsmoking boozers with one thing on their minds time hasnt changed men all that much but sexual harassment has women are in the workplace only passing time until they find a husband settle down some of the dialog is cringeworthy but yet its charming in an innocent passé way i love the opening credits that show a romantic exciting view of manhattan with johnny mathis singing the best of everything on the soundtrack i want to jump right into some scenes filmed on ny streets circa 1959 experience a time ive only seen on film in photographs some scenes in this movie reminded me of melanie griffiths working girl especially when hope lange whos a cross between grace kelly dolores hart gets bombed in handsome stephen boyds apartment he tucks her in just watches her sleep like melanie she wants to know if anything happened between them the following day joan crawford is definitely comparable to sigourney weavers horrible female boss except she was outwardly nasty with a soft core but sigourneys character was sweet on the outside horrible on the inside i found it distressing how the suzy parker character gregg started out as an independent woman with career goals to be an actress who supposedly didnt need a man to complete her ended up she becomes a stalkerlunaticnutjob when she lets the man she falls in love with drive her bananas after hes done with her i loved the character mary agnes the office gossip with her thick new yawk accent if you enjoy films like valley of the dolls youll like this one too,1
how in the name of all thats holy did this film ever get distribution it looks as if it has been shot on someones mobile phone and takes the screaming girl victim scenario to whole new depths they literally scream for the full 90 minutes of the movie and thats all they do there is no plot no tension no characters and not a lot of acting just screaming and more screamingbr br i gave up after fifteen minutes and fastwound through it to see if anything happened it doesnt except for screaming of course odlly enough the act of going through it on fast forward highlights another problem there is no camerawork to speak of every shot looks like every other shot middle distance one angle dull dull dullbr br its not so bad its good its just plain bad,0
a repressed housewife an annoying lisping angie dickinson whose body double treatshorrifies us with an extreme closeup of her delicates is sexually bored by her husband and decides to branchout this directly results in a string of murders that soon involve a highclass prostitute nancy allen clearly i am in the wrong business if she can bring home 600 a night and her psychologist michael caine if you are going to watch de palma rip off excuse me pay homage to hitchcock watch sisters instead of this dressed to kill while loaded with style and technical skill is one of the tackiest thrillers i have had the displeasure of sitting through the plot is absurd and tired it does feature some surprisingly effective jump scares and nasty graphic murder sequences that should please any horror fan as long as they can get past the silly story line that must have been dated even in 1980,0
when i first became a father about 55 years ago i was prepared for many of the sacrifices id have to make i knew id have to change diapers and take them to swimming lessons and attend many a freezing santa claus parade but i wasnt ready for the kind of sacrifice i made last night this in my humble opinion is cruel and unusual punishmentbr br underdog is bad its not quite karate dog bad but it makes the shaggy dog feel like pulp fiction if underdog were a television show id recommend flipping on by not even the presence of puddy and the voice of banky edwards can save it bow wowbr br it was also just about the best 80 minutes ive ever enjoyed james was seated to the right of me and michelle to the left and i spent more time watching their reaction to this talking flying mutt than watching the screen at 5 and 3 years old they were the target audience and this movie nailed the target theres a scene where underdog belches loudly in another dogs face and michelle thought it was the funniest scene ever captured on film when underdog was flying into outer space james was literally at the edge of his seat mesmerized the kids absolutely loved underdog and thats why i was there thats what last night was all aboutbr br unless youre accompanying someone under the age of ten you have no business wasting a second of your life watching this brutal film but if you are looking to kill 80 minutes with your four year old i wont judge i had a blast,0
marvelous film again dealing with the trials and tribulations of world war 11 england what makes this film so good is the touching of the human elementthis film is definitely in the tradition of such british line classics such as mrs miniver and hope and glory as is the case with this film we see the desperation of people in the time of warbr br the performances are outstanding here especially by the embittered john thaw who is assigned a child who has been evacuated from the london bombingbr br we soon see why this child wets his bed he comes from a lunatic mother who has abused him terriblybr br the old man takes to the child and brings happiness into his sad life when the child is returned to his mother the old man goes to london and seeks him out only to find tragedy he literally kidnaps the boy and is able to convince a higher up that the child is better off with him than being in a boys homebr br the picture is so good because it deals and builds on endearing relationships,1
despite positive reviews and screenings at the international festivals this movie is not for everyonebr br the story is very similar to other movies in which a teenage girl from the family of immigrants needs to overcome many common personal problems of her age and also to struggle against the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family she does that by choosing some kind of sport and with the help of a local boy that for some reason falls in love with her she confronts her problems and winsbr br in girlfight its boxing in bend it like beckham its soccer and now its kung fubr br but fighter is much inferior product than these two it was simply embarrassing to watch it semra turan the actress that playing the role of a teenage girl maybe can do a lot of things but one thing she cant do is to act her presence on the screen is anemic and clumsy the dramatic situations in which she tries to show some emotions are dreadful her body and facial language are of amateur actress badly instructed by the director the rest of the cast is a little better but they just cannot save this cliché movie with stereotypical characters and shallow plot besides a few relatively good moments this movie has nothing new or interesting to offerbr br even the kung fu fighting is not a reason to watch this its just so boring the slow motion was really unnecessary the choreography was basic and lacked the inspiration and most of the kung fu scenes are just training or standing in all kind of kung fu positions not actually fighting not to mention how ridiculous it looks when a small and skinny girl fights big and muscular boys and knocks them off their feet br br the only reason this movie has been noticed at all is because its european its very easy to publicize this movie a first martial arts film from denmark but dont be fooled its not its just a drama about stupid teenage girl and her problems which are by the way not really convincingbr br bad movie with embarrassing lines acting and story,0
teresa pavlinek was a popular member of the toronto second city cast she has done numerous guest spots and commercials up here in canada finally someone has the sense to create a show for her the supporting case seems quite good too i have now watched the pilot several times and i still find it refreshing though i am not sure why the show is listed as the jane show 2004 i might be wrong but as far as i am aware the show was conceptualized in 2005 and appeared on global tv in canada in early 2006 it is a fresh idea and hopefully it does well too bad this couldnt be paired up with corner gas now i know corner gas is on ctv but the two shows would be great companion pieces,1
the mayor of hell has the feel of an early dead end kids film but with a much harder edge and very few light spots preceding the first appearance of the dead enders by four years james cagney has a full screen opening credit even though technically the mayor of the movies title is actually portrayed by frankie darro one of several boys sent to reform school during the opening scenes darros character is jimmy smith a young tough whos befriended by patsy gargan cagney and is elected to the position when gargan takes a chance at humanizing conditions at a state reformatorybr br warner brothers made a lot of these types of films attempting to provide a conscience of sorts in an era that only too well knew about the effects of crime and poverty this movie is quite gritty with no apologies for ethnic stereotyping as in the submissive posture of a black father in court or the way a jewish kid gets to run a candy shop in the reform school the rules at the reformatory are simple enough work hard and keep your mouth shut step out of line and you answer personally to warden thompson dudley diggesbr br cagneys role in the story seems somewhat ambiguous since even though he makes a serious effort to improve conditions inside the reformatory on the outside hes still nominally in control of a criminal racket the films attempt to juggle this dichotomy falls short in my estimation the finale attempts to wrap things up in a neat package as gargan awaits the outcome of a near fatal shooting of one of his henchmen not exactly the kind of role modeling one would look for in a film like thisbr br warner brothers would sanitize some of the elements of this story in a 1938 remake titled crime school featuring humphrey bogart in the cagney role and billy halop in the frankie darro part if youre partial to the dead end kids youll probably like the latter film better since it also offers familiar faces like leo gorcey huntz hall bobby jordan and gabriel dell however the ending is somewhat muddied in that one too with bogarts warden character involved in a cover up of a prison breakout both films offer a romantic interest for the lead characters in mayor madge evans is a reform minded nurse that falls for cagneys characterbr br curiously a lot of james cagneys early films arent commercially available so youll have to keep your eyes peeled for a screening on turner classics or source the film from a private collector personally i cant get enough of this kind of stuff and find intriguing points of interest in the films of all genres from the thirties and forties,1

this film is more than the story of danton it was a joint polish french production filmed at the time of the beginning of the end of the soviet system it probably helped spur the solidarity movements union activity it is more about poland in the 20th century than the french revolution solidarity began the end of the system this film itself is historical by its very existencethe rest is historybr br robspiere aka totalitarian leaders danton aka walensa when one watches this film one must remember the snowball which began in poland br br actually it could be useful for seeing the superpower struggle within the only superpower left,1
i just saw the movie through netflix i was intrigued by the way the movie was described but in the end it was better i was moved in many different directions while watching this movie i was filled with hurt hate angry bitternesspain and finally relief to look at the young man accused would break your heart and convince you that they had the wrong person the smugness of the police makes you cring because just as the rodney king beating brought to light the brutality of the police this movie brings forth the total lack of moral fiber in these police and the fact that they beat this boy and got away with it only infuriates you morebr br but i have to tell you i fell in love with the attorney mc guinness one of my favorite lines when he was telling us what an ahole on of the cops was the cop told him to go on keep sucking on that cancer stick mc guinness told the cop i always have a cigarette before sex i was letting him know i was going to screw himbr br i have a new respect for some of the law in this country,1
plankton or creatures from the abyss as im positive its more commonly known as filmed under as the title creatures from the abyss appears over a moving image in the same font type as the rest of the credits starts with five 20 something kids mike clay rogers his girlfriend margaret sharon twomey sisters julie ann wolf dorothy loren depalm an annoying idiot named bobby michael bon whom decide to all fit into a small rubber boat head out to sea dont ask why as i dont know oh the complete idiot bobby left the petrol behind never thought to tell anyone so it comes as no great surprise that they end up stranded out at sea without any petrol for the motor to make matters worse they become trapped in a thunder storm discover a dead body floating in the water shortly after their luck seems to change when they come across a yacht potential safety in a flash everyone boards the yacht begin to explore first of all they find a scientific lab with various fish specimens computer equipment then down below they find fully furnished luxurious cabins they find a chemist deran sarafian who appears mad cant talk they eat fish from the fridge which makes dorothy puke up green vomit beetles slugs they learn that these fish are living fossils 1000s of years old have been contaminated by toxic waste dumped in the sea that they fly mutate bite are generally unpleasant to be around i really cant be bothered to go on with this plot outline so i wont heres what i thinkbr br this italian production was produced directed by massimiliano cerchi under the pseudonym al passeri id hide under a different name if i made a film this bad too i think plankton is quite simply one of the worst films ever there are so many things wrong with this film its difficult to know where to start first the script by richard baumann is total crap it makes no sense whatsoever is so slow dull it was torture for me to sit through why would five people just simply set sail for the middle of the ocean on a rubber dinghy barely big enough to fit them all in what were they planning on doing exactly why do we often get pointofview shots from these fish creatures but they seem to be totally invisible to the characters as they are never shown on screen even though they are right next to a character how do these fish get around the boat as there is no water for them to swim in peoples actions reactions to things are all wrong they constantly split up they make bizarre decisions that simply dont make any sense in the situation they find themselves in some of the dialogue is as awful as anything ive heard i could go on all day about all the plot holes ridiculous goings on but ill run out of space if i do the fish creatures themselves look awful a mixture of rubbish,0
this movie is just too funny a totally nonpc gangster romp if mel brooks made a picture about the mob in the 30s it would probably look like this too many great oneliners to to remember and while its not for everyone anyone who doesnt laugh a whole bunch of times doesnt have a pulse so put it on and laugh you iceholes,1
the subspecies series is an always will be the best vampire movies ever there is something about them that makes them special i think its the feeling you get when you watch them br br they are set in modern times and yet they feel as if they are set in the 1700s or 1800s i think it has some thing to do with the sets that are used if so then its working keep it up guys br br in a quick round up of whats happened in the first part radu was supposedly bannished from his home land years ago by his father and he has decided to come back and take what he thinks is his birth rite the blood stone and all his father has so he kills his father who is played by angus scrimm the tall man from the phantasm movies and takes the blood stone which has emense power to who ever has it because who has it need never kil anyone again because the stone is supposedly meant to drip the bloody of the saints and every time the radu takes a drop from it he is slowly going insane thats all we need an insane vampire as if a normal vampire aint bad enough well radus brother stephan trys to put a stop to his evil ways all while trying to stop himself falling inlve with a tourist who is staying at a housefort which belongs to a friend of hisbr br well one thing leads to another and the two brothers clash and well you will have to see the movie to see what goes on from here on inbr br i will reviewcomment on the other sequels soon br br the difference between this and buffy is buffy is too commercial and this is not so this will not appeal to everyone but this has an atmosphere far superior to that of buffy although radu does not look as good as the wonder full sarah michelle gellar br br rating for this movie 1010 a fine example of how a vampire movie should be done br br,1
i love this movie as a kid this was one of the first movies i saw that made me flinch sure it is mild now but back in the day it was awesome dentists are one thing so many people fear so why not do a movie about a killer dentist its cheesy its fun sometimes its scary but it is awesome and i have always had a love for medical horror and corbin bernsen plays dr feinstone perfectly no one could have done it better and for a low budget horror film the effects and such are quite good and i also love the theme music it goes well with the film ken foree dawn of the dead is also in this one playing a nosy cop and does a fine job there is a fair amount of blood and some really cool torturedeath scenes check this one out,1
firstly let me get this of my chest i hate octopussy with an absolute passion what is so frustrating is that it had so much potential and had a very good opening sequence unfortunately post the opening sequence it all goes downhill firstly there was absolutely no plot to begin with just an excuse for moore to tell his corny jokes next there are several sequences that would make a bond fan cringefor instance the sequence in which bond turns up to diffuse a bomb dressed as a clown the villains are pretty poor louis jordon fails to make an impact as kamal khan and bollywood veteran kabir bedi is equally poor as his henchman its funny that when people debate over what the worst bond movie is and octopussy gets overlooked when it can easily give them a run for their money,0
i rented boogie nights last week and i could tell you when i watched the film i had a blast if you think that when you watch the film you will get sicked by the porn i mean yes if your not a porn person who cant bother being by it than this isnt the film to see but the thing is the whole film isnt really about porn well halfway through the film is about the porn industry but the other half is about the character development and the bad situations these characters go through the actors played there roles perfect especially mark wahlberg john c reilly and william h macy the sex scenes of course are terrific but mainly focus on the characters hype in porn films until there struggles excellent film one of the best br br hedeens outlook 1010 a,1
if you think about it its nearly unbelievable that a film could be made about the death penalty one of the worlds most controversial topics that offends neither those for nor against its a testament to tim robbins extraordinary intelligence and sensitivity traits that can be seen in his acting roles as well shawshank redemption jacobs ladderbr br this film in fact hints at a subtle compromise between the for and against camps so subtle that it cant be put into words subtle to the point of vanishing yet one gets the sense after watching the picture that a compromise is possible that somehow it can be worked out if only we look deeply enough,1
this movie is not worth the time it takes to put it in the vcr or dvd player michael dudikoff and lisa howard are two bounty hunters in love yet they are total opposites she is ambitious and organized while he is laid back and totally scatter brainedbr br in this movie bad guys are chasing jersey bellini dudikoffs character this opens the door to bad godfather impressions ludicrous fight scenes and tony curtis playing the most effeminate looking mob boss i have ever seen the ending has to be the mostunbelievable scene i have seen in a movie in quite some time i would believe the terminator even the matrix has a better chance of possibly being true than this ending this movie just reeks of cheapness the script had to have hit someone as being totally ridiculous yet the green light was given for this piece of dung to be made and let loose on on unsuspecting public i watched this movie with several other people who all agreed that we had been cheated no one in the group could say anything good about the film except that it was over,0
i think this programme is a load of rubbish all they do is argue and slap each other across the face and they call this acting these people get paid lots of money for this and most of them cant even act to save their lives also the story lines are awful and after watching it for a few minutes i am bored with it i like the way that harry hill takes the mickey out of it on his tv show tv burp eg the weak joke the princess and the pea isnt exactly shakespeare is it that had sonia and naomi in stitches i dont see how that is funny i think this is a waste of everybodys money for their tv licence so this can be shown 45 days a week isnt there anything better than this,0
ive seen some biblebased trash this one tops it all to make matters worse it lasts about three hours a horrible waste of time unless you want to match your kids biblical knowledge against the innumerable aberrations do yourself a favor take a walk in the sahara instead since i am required to give you a ten line statement of why not to watch this movie let me just say there is absolutely no redeemable quality to it gods conversations with noah are ridiculous the whole thing has a stench of lets make the biblical account look retarded the basic logic goes if they spent the money on a biblical film why not make it worthwhile since the basic logic is not met something is amiss the movie starts with a disclaimer about poetic licenses takenthat is the understatement of the century poetic rape but then poetic would be an unmerited favor,0
if you love movies about fruity dudes who prance around with a top hats and canes while spouting off random line of poetry while stabbing their victims then this is the movie for youbr br if you like movies where it looks like the whole thing was shot with a camcorder and when people get disemboweled their internal organs are made out of baked ziti an marinara sauce this movie is even more for you br br and if you simply love movies where the acting and dialogue sucks so much that it makes you feel dead inside then for gods sake run to the video store right now and buy this movie right now hurry go before it sells out,0

i was so happy to learn that hari om will finally be theatrically released in 2007 i saw this film three years ago at the vancouver international film festival and have been waiting for its release ever since so i could send everyone i know to see it its like taking a trip to indiacolorful magical thought provoking aside from one rather strange hollywood style auto rickshaw chase scene this movie is very realistic this is not a bollywood style song and dance movie but it does have drama and romance and humor the interactions between the indian taxi driver and the french tourist are a good reflection on the fundamental differences between eastern and western life styles and philosophy the characters are a little broadly drawn but the acting was very good visually this movie is a treat as you really do get a sense of what driving through rajasthan is likedreamlike sometimes its hard to believe everything you are seeing and experiencing is realthe movie has that same quality great soundtrack too,1
i recently rented this video after seeing final ascent by the same writer i wasnt prepared for how intense this film would get i found it engaging from start to finish and was rooting for the teenagers to get away with their attempted crime the ending was definitely disturbing with some of its implied violence but welldone i highly recommend this picture,1
for anyone who has only seen disney productions beautifully animated version of beauty the beast or even jean cocteaus surreal fairy tale vision will be quite taken aback by this 1975 french but with a director from poland version the plot concerns a french family of fading aristocracy that is marrying into a well to do english family the major catch is that the bridegroom is carrying an ancient curse on the family the film also includes many flashback sequences potentially explaining this family curse from the opening credits to the very end its a nearly non stop erotic fun house ride with some very explicit graphic sexual content hence the films x rating in the us in its initial runwhich is now unrated the films somewhat contemptuous sentiment at the ruling class will probably remind one of bunuels flights into similar territory if you have a taste for the truly bizarre and are not offended by taboo material then this film may just scratch that itch for you,1
the snow queen is based on the famous and very beautiful fairytale by hans christian andersen about a girl gerda who goes on a dangerous journey to rescue her friend kai from the clutches of the snow queen this adaption attempts to capture that storys sense of adventure and luminously intricate imagery through lavish sets and production design but fails on a number of countsbr br like so many hallmark productions the potential of the story is completely undercut by heavyhanded scripting and direction the two actors playing gerda and kai are blandly pleasant but forgettable bridget fonda as the snow queen looks the part but is otherwise miscast for the role theres a notable lack of dramatic tension to this meandering threehour miniseries at least some of the pacing problems can be attributed to the addition of filler scenes that add very little to the original story particularly in the opening hour that introduces the main charactersbr br that said the snow queen would be just about ideal for preteens with a liking for fantasy and a bit of patience its great eyecandy without being scary and the acting is pitched at the sort of pantomime overthetop level that spells out the storyline in very very bold text just make sure you read them andersens story too,0

there isnt much in the way of spoilers since there isnt a plot to reveal but still i guess i describe some of what happens so this is it this is the most nonsensical film ive ever seen there are simply no words to describe this movie although bizarre ridiculous and ego trip are pretty close the opening half hour or so are really really weird music videos with absolutely no plot or continuity apart from that mj falls into some from the previous one of the highlights of this part of the film in the section where mj is flying a merrygoround aeroplane through what seem to be halfarsed bond intro rejects and sections cut from yellow submarine dear lord you could not make this upbr br then with a little over an hour remaining the film begins with a lot of claymation some of it really creepy spotting our hero and chasing him looking for an autograph obviously this leaves our as of yet mute discounting songs lead somewhat worried and he manages to temporarily lose them fortunate for him because it means he can witness a falling star and and again im not making this up turn into a claymation rabbit he uses this cunning disguise to try and sneak past them but for reasons i cant recall right now they see through it oh no and the creepy chase begins again cue another song big shock therebr br shortly after the end of the chase mj somehow brings the rabbit to life until he is busted by a policeman in the middle of the desert because it is apparently illegal to dance therebr br the rest of the film is equally as strange highlights including mj cleaning up a bar to the tune of smooth criminal including shooting a man with his finger not only killing the guy but burning his shadow into the wall a la nuclear fission weapons another good moment is when mj seeing mr big joe what the hell happened to his career at this point peschi kidnap one of the children he was friends with magically creates a tommy gun and in another moment of violence that pepper this film seemingly at random opens fire at everything that moves a final moment i shall mention is when mj surrounded by mr big and his private army seriously this guy has dozens of people working for him and theyre decked out more like commando units rather than mobsters which i guess they are how does he get out why he turns into a robot complete with weapons and shield this is the third of four transformations he makes almost always when backed into a corner andor on the runbr br this film is quite quite surreal with little in the way of plot and virtually no continuity,1
this has to be one of the worst movies i have seen i tried to like this movie but they managed to mess up practically every individual aspect that pertain to this film cheap dialogue no character development no tension not enough story to pull you in no action apart from some really cheap scenes it seems they tried some things on the set and said to each other hey this looks rather cool why not put this in there after which the director probably said yeahyeah this is genius and got back to snorting coke or something when it comes to acting i think the only person that tried to make the movie worked is daan schuurmans but in the end it is all for nothing cause this movie sucks 210,0
this is a very entertaining film which follows the rehearsal process of a ny production of macbeth although it has a lot to say about power jealousy and ambition the themes of macbeth in our modern world the film works best when it is not taking itself too seriously recognizable actors such as john glover gloria reubens and david lansbury do nice jobs in the main roles but the highlight for me was the hilarious scene where the murder of banquo john elsen is rehearsed probably a more entertaining film for those involved in theatre but anyone who enjoys shakespeare should enjoy this film,1
i usually read reviews before i watch a movie guess what i didnt do that before watching tlb and i have to say i was very surprised to see the above average rating at imdb i found it to have a total lack of story you just get dropped into it and sadly not in the way saving private ryan dropped us into the movie and it also has a sudden end which was very unsatisfying for mebr br i have to admit the wounded soldiers looked pretty realistic to me especially with the low budget in mind but prepare yourself to have a laugh some guys are being tossed through the air after an explosion as if they are olympic gymnasts a midair corkscrew or somersault during ww i is a bit too much for me especially when its performed countless times during the moviebr br but the parts that really got me laughing until i almost cried were the scenes containing close combat the screaming and shouting german voicesunbelievably funny it seems as if they are spoken by one single actor voice performer because they all sound exactly the same and it just sounds like a typical german voicebr br i would absolutely not recommend this movie to anyone except to people who just want to have some laughs because of the sad and corny quality of it,0
to be fair they did as well as they could with a budget of five shillings and sixpence but the dialogue was more cheesy than 9lbs of emmental and the cgi was a little old hat now maybe if some of the actors were not so perfectly chiselled out of granite it would have made the film a little better too to say this was awful is to do this film a misservice if you want to see something that is totally execrable you gotta sit and waste a couple of hours of your life watching sickle that is soo mind numbingly awful its actually goodseveral large alcoholic beverages are deriguer though any road up i enjoyed this film and its gotta be worth a look if you have not seen it yet just dont expect anything along the lines of jurassic parkthe lost world or apocalypto,0
michelle rodrigez was made for this movie when i first saw her in fast and the furious you could tell that she was a tough woman with this movie she has not only proven her acting but shows no fear and is tough like she should be in this movie she is more a bad girl and thats what i like about her this movie is about a troubled girl living the life as a tom boy and getting in constant trouble with school and family as she gets interested in her brothers training to be a boxer she decides to go after her love to fight and asks her brothers trainer to train her even though they dont think she has the potential they get to be shown proven wrongbr br i think this movie was a little slow at the ending but was well done it shows that people can do anything even if they dont think you have the potential i recommend it to be seen,1
this is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time the director did a wonderful job showing the contrasts between social classes a situation that is very pertinent in france today all the characters are lovable especially juliette and her family the development of the romance is while not entirely realistic at least plausible and does a wonderful job showing how much people will change for love i found this to be a heartwarming cinderella story but one in which cinderella is a powerful woman in and of herself i laughed through this entire film and absolutely loved it i recommend romuald et juliette to anyone who enjoys unique characters comedy and nontraditional romance,1
i watched this movie a couple of weeks ago and must say i was not impressed not at all i do side with the other posters when it comes to the fine performances but some good performances do not make a good moviebr br on the discussion board i found a review by an anonymous poster that captured some of the main points it says deed poll is a movie that raises many questions but hardly answers even a few a movie that is disturbing and above every attempt at categorizing an experiment and a very conventional sexual drama despite some shocking scenes the brilliant acting of barbara kowa and andré schneider the partly very impressive editing and the good camera work steffen ritter make up for gross plot holes and some technical slips especially in sound however the boredom the audiences have to deal with for 40 minutes remains unfortunately this is true i wasnt intrigued by the story at all the protagonists are cold ambitionless people they do a lot of drugs and have a lot of incestuous sex so what for many times the direction seemed to be virtually nonexistent not to mention the technical aspect the poor sound quality was enormously disturbingbr br whats the point of the movie whats the message behind it all the anonymous reviewer said somehow biermann failed to make a clear point and so the movie remains hanging in midair without a message thus the boredom i blame on the movie the movie is reserved and emotionless cold almost neutral and it doesnt take long to see the flaws for long stretches the characters of sean and ivy are not credible they clearly have difficulties with the english pronunciation the character of the mute brother is not developed very well some moments are very promising though in the scene where the call boy is skinned the one and only true love scene an intensity is reached that one would love to see the whole movie long as a spectator one has to regret the chances given away again i must agree i did like the final scene especially because of the beautifully captured faces of gianni meurer and andré schneider but it was nothing compared to the boredom i had to suffer for the first thirty minutes the sex scenes though were aesthetically staged and perfectly editedbr br all in all deed poll was not my cup of tea a good controversial idea wasted but it was a interesting to see how a movie can be made with practically no money maybe if they had a bigger budget and a more experienced director this would have become a better movie,0

bloodsuckers has the potential to be a somewhat decent movie the concept of military types tracking down and battling vampires in space is one with some potential in the cheesier realm of things even the idea of the universe being full of various different breeds of vampire all with different attributes many of which the characters have yet to find out about is kind of cool as well as to how most of the life in the galaxy outside of earth is vampire im not sure how the makers meant for that to work given the nature of vampires who the hell they are meant to be feeding on if almost everyone is a vampire i dont know as it is the movie comes across a low budget mix of fireflyserenity and vampires movies with a dash of aliensbr br the action parts of the movie are pretty average and derivative particularly of serenity but passable they are reasonably well executed and there is enough gore for a vampire flick including some of the comical bloodspurting variety there is a lot of character stuff most of which is tedious coming from conflicts between characters who mostly seem like whiny immature arseholes primarily cowboy dude and asian woman there are a few character scenes that actually kind of work and the actors dont play it too badly but it mostly slows things down a nice try at fleshing the characters out but people dont watch a movie called bloodsuckers for character development and drama the acting is actually okay michael ironside hams it up and is as fun to watch as ever and at least of a couple of the women are hot the space sfx arent too bad for what is clearly a low budget work the story is again pretty average and derivative but as i said the world created has a little bit of potential the way things are set up bloodsuckers really does seem like the pilot for a tv series character dynamics introduced the world introduced but not explored etc br br the film does have a some highlights and head scratching moments the kind of stuff that actually makes these dodgy productions watchable the scene where our heroes interrogate a talking sock puppet chestburster type creature hilarious the sex scene wtf indeed the credit and michael ironside as muco the most annoying aspect of it all though is the really awful and usually inappropriate pop music they have playing very loud over half the scenes of the movie it is painful to listen to and only detracts from what is only average at bestbr br basically an okay watch is youre up for something cheesy even if it is just for the chestburster scene,0
this is not the true story it is the darkest possible fiction derived from the events it endorses suicide morose obsession with death a totally gratuitous sideswipe at organized religion in general and the anglican church in particular and generally provides a nihilistic pointless world view from which filmgoers i suppose are intended to walk away richer in their poverty and more hopeful in their hopelessnessbr br utter trash though attractively performed by a capable cast that anyone would suggest this is a true rendering however is very much false advertising you want the real story rent fairy tale thats the real story see if you can find any correspondence between the facts presented in either case i only found one the girls who made the original photographs were prepubescent,0
dont say i didnt warn you but your gonna laugh probably enough to hurt your stomach sure its got some blood splattering all in good fun though so its got no budget who needs a budget when you got a script like this br br take the time and check this out well worth a two hour viewing if everyone could laugh as much as i did during this movie the world would be a much happier place to livebr br,1
the animation is great ill concede to that but disney perpetuated every stereotype we alaskans have been trying to overcome for the last two generations and the names i mean come onsitka kenai tanana denahi cheesy takeoff of denali those are real places where real people live and the real people these real places were named for are probably struggling out of the earth seeking vengeance over this trite little flick disney youre based out of california florida right amidst the rest of the states that still treat us like a foreign country if you cant stick to what you know at least hire andor work with people who know what area youre trying to caricuture maybe then it wouldnt be so insulting,0
this movie scared the crap out of me i have to admit that i spent most of the film watching through my fingers but what i saw was really scary i screamed out loud two or three times during the showbr br filmmakingwise my favorite aspects were the sound and photography the sound was particularly great and the setting was really creepy beautiful i read somewhere that its some weird husband and wife team that made it for some reason that makes this even stranger for me br br if you enjoy the jumps and jitters of scary movies than this one is for you very suspenseful and a great movie to rent with a bunch of friends who love to watch movies curled up on a sofa screaming like little girls,1
i have seen this film only the one time about 25 years ago and to this day i have always told people it is probably the best film i have ever seen considering there was no verbal dialogue and only thought dialogue i found the film to be enthralling and i even found myself holding my breath so as not to make any sound i would highly recomend this film i wish it was available on dvd,1
noroi follows a documentary filmmaker masafumi kobayashi as he slowly uncovers something mysterious and evil thats leaving a trail of dead bodies in its wake after interviewing a woman who claims to hear loud babys cries coming from the house next door where there is no baby kobayashi heads over to talk to the neighbor hes greeted with hostility by the unhinged disheveled woman maria takagi who answers the door and promptly slams it in his face and gets a peek at her 6yearold son through a window strangely both the woman and her son disappear just days after his visit leaving behind a pile of dead pigeons on their back porch and the woman who first complained about the noises as well as her daughter are both killed in a mysterious accident not long after that this piques kobayashis interest and he sets out on a quest to find out whats going on he soon uncovers that those with psychic abilities and extrasensory perception seem to be tuning into something sinister unexplainable and possibly even apocalyptic wellknown 10yearold clairvoyant and tv celebrity kana rio kanno seems to think we may all be doomed but she mysteriously disappears before she can be of much help another female psychicactress marika matsumoto becomes involved as does mr nori a mentally unstable kookpsychic who wears a hat and jacket made of aluminum foil and thinks people are being eaten by what he refers to ectoplasmic worms clues eventually lead back to the site of a small village thats now covered by a lake and the legend of an ancient demon known as kagutababr br unlike many other handheld horror flicks this one depends just as much on the plot as it does reactionary firstperson scares thankfully theres something of a storyline here a very interesting and intricate one at that so it doesnt rely on glimpses of horrific things through spastic camerawork every once in awhile to keep your interest the way masafumi travels around following leads in search of the truth with well placed jolts along the way reminded me somewhat of the omen in its pacing the film also doesnt entirely consist of footage shot by the documentarian but weaves in news reports and television variety shows as if what were watching is an already completed documentary that helps to break up some of the monotony usually associated with films shot in this particular style the performances are good enough not to harm any of the realism of the actual footage either overall its a wellmade horror film with lots of plot shifts some suspense and quite a few genuinely creepy moments thats well worth checking out my only real gripe is that it could have used a little trimming here and there and seems to go on a bit too long otherwise pretty good stuff,1
i just want to say that i was thrilled to find these comments about the show i have tried online searches for info about the show in the past with no luck i loved the show i have a hard time getting motivated to exercise but this show made it fun as another comment mentioned that it wasnt so complicated as the routines nowadays it was an ideal workout that got the job done i would give anything to be able to buy a copy of just one workout i remember many of the moves but not nearly all of it somebody please try to get it back on the air and also make it available on dvd it is so great to know i wasnt the only one that loved that show thanks for making my day,1

star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br alice having defeated freddy at the end of the last film is now trying to readjust her life but her unborn child is carrying a demonous presence freddy trying to come out into their world againbr br its interesting to note the directors who got their big breaks directing freddy films charles russell eraser the mask renny harlin the long kiss goodnight cutthroat island cliffhanger die hard 2 and here stephen hopkins lost in space predator 2 but while russell and harlin made a good job of it hopkins imo has made something of a podge with this entry that should be quickly forgottenbr br the story is clearly being stretched as far as it can go here with freddy ludicrously a father himself and the ridiculous looking demon baby even at about an hour and a half it all gets rather tiresome and of course not scary at allbr br the bon appetit bitch catchphrase is the only memorable point of this other wise very forgettable entry,0
faith and mortality viewed through the lens of an elderly ashkenazi jewishamerican gentleman and a younger africanamerican jewish gentleman who waver between being at odds with each other and having frank talks about how their lives have unfolded over the yearsbr br mostels character is a tailor with chronic back problems and a terminally ill wife belafontes character is a career hustler never settling on a regular job and a fatal car accident leaves him in an odd purgatory he must convince mostel to renew his faith as it has been failing along with his wifes health and his own but belafontes levine has his own problems still pining for the girlfriend he left behindbr br belafontes character leaves the film before he seemingly should and so the the ending is cryptic and the film suffers somewhat from its ambiguous endingbr br this is not a typical hollywood movie on ethnic relations or about a persons crisis of faith it is worth watching more than once and appreciating the excellent performances of the principal actors,1
my name is heather and i am the girl whose story this movie was based on i want to thank all of you who saw this movie and enjoyed it as crude and harsh as some of the things that were depicted in this movie were it didnt really even come close to describing how bad things actually were not to mention the affect everything had on my mother and little sister thanks once again for the great comments that everyone hadi truly appreciate thembr br hi everyonebr br this is heathers mom its hard to believe that so many years have gone by since this movie was made harder even to believe that people were still watching it a year ago for any of you out there who have gone thru the same or similar kind of situation please know that there are people out here in cyberspace that do understand completely how you feel our thoughts and prayers are with each and every one of you,1
firstly there are some good things about this film but its all cliche slasher stuff combined with a teen movie in the advertising of this movie that ive seen a large emphasis was on the fact that denise richards is in it but shes a poor actress and not as good looking as people try to make her out to be not that that has anything to do with the movie and whats with that look she gives everyone perhaps its part of the character but like i said the acting still the writing is fine you know who it is all throughout the movie and you can almost predict what is about to happen but not in an irritating way i think the book its based on is probably good judging by the plot line but next time ill read the book to find out rather than watch this,0
i saw this in the theatre a couple decades ago and fuzzy recollection suggests that i liked it however seeing it for a second time two things stand out 1 very poor acting on the part of michelle johnson and 2 very poor music throughoutbr br its not that all the music was bad some of the brazilian music was fine but the theme song and others that clanged their way in were reminiscent of the worst of 80s pop musicbr br johnsons voice seemed all wrong possibly dubbed this was distractingbr br on the positive side 1 the storys not bad 2 its interesting seeing such a young demi moore 3 valerie harper never looked better and 4 johnson did look quite fetching in various stages of disattire,0
this movie is not funny it just takes the dd nerd stereotypes and amplifies them all the main characters make less than 30k a year they all live with their parents theyre all socially retarded and they have no luck with women the jokes are horrible and unimaginative such as two of the gamers getting beat up by a black midget because one of them had a kkk looking hood on it was his wizard costume and the other guy had on a john rocker warm up oh how funny hes a nerd so he doesnt know about sports you may have to be a childish highschooler to find any of this stuff funny poorly done mockmuntaries are so painful to watch but obviously extremely cheap to make i feel sorry for kelly lebrock and beverly dangelo i guess these are the only opportunities available for hotties way past their prime,0
this is such a great film never mind the low rating here i really have no idea where that came from they must be discussing a different film then because i absolutely loved it and found it to be a little hidden treasure br br its story was so original and charming i really cant think of anything bad to say about it maybe it has to be your type of thing but i saw this with my sister and my mother and we all were taken by it br br the acting was also very good and that is hard to do in a film like this but i found all the characters very intriguing and sympathetic br br ive always been very fond of dougray scott and found his new dark role very interesting it is really awful hard to get me to like a bad guy but i absolutely had no problem with that this time even more so i adored him br br everyone who loves a good thrillerdrama that also has a good dose of love and tragedy should definitely go see this film no question about that anyone wanting to see a film with 80 bloodshed should go rent something else though but i guess the title already kind of gives that away this is a love story not saw 3br br i give this film 4 out of five stars good jobbr br xxx enjoy,1
this film seems to be a rip off of many movies that have dealt with the same subject in the past let the future viewer be forewarned that art heist doesnt add anything to the genre director bryan goeres has no clue what to do with the filmbr br william baldwin keeps reappearing in films and frankly one wonders if he has a great agent or is it that directors and producers love his unusual goofy looks complimented by that strange hairdo he sports in most of his movies the only good movie in which he has appeared is the squid and the whale in which he only speaks two or three lines ellen pompeo his leading lady doesnt fare much better there is no chemistry between ms pompeo and mr baldwinbr br a movie to be seen at the viewers own risk,0
this game was made by sega being made by sega i didnt expect much but i also didnt expect this junk either for starters the camera angles work against you in this game the motorcycle is your means of getting around the motorcycle is the worst part in the game whenever you run in to something you just stick there and you dont move you never fall off the bike or wreck for that matter the main character hardly talks even though hes got a voice that suits him the graphics are horrible you ride through trees on your bike the camera makes fighting the enemy impossible this game wouldnt even be worth renting,0
this is a polarising film people either love it or despise it it seems me i despise it the film comes from the same context as lindsay andersons oh lucky man but while that is a masterpiece this is just horriblebr br both films take kafkas unfinished novel america for their inspiration and general ideal america is a surreal story of a youths travels through the country kafka uses the this character as a pure observer one who does not change over the course of the journey although the book is about 300 pages and still seems only a quarter finished so well never know allowing kafka to concentrate and comment on the absurdsurreal situations and surroundings oh lucky man follows this same template to show britain through the eyes of malcolm mcdowell and weekend does the same for francebr br both films are also hugely brechtian using various tricks and techniques to point up the fact that this is not real this is confabulation etc but the difference comes where oh lucky man uses the constructed film to convey the absurdity of life and the class system weekend uses the constructed film to bludgeon us to death with ideological polemic because godard goes further than anderson in his brechtian principles we end up with two principle characters in which we have no investment at all were forced to spend 90 minutes with them yet we couldnt care less about them deliberately so but in doing this godard leaves us with a film that is entirely about his own message which in the first half of the film is provided through relentless and overbearing symbolism and in the second half through a series of long speeches directed to camera combined with unpleasant and unnecessary scenes such as the really horrible pig slaying far worse than any of the off camera violence of the car crashesbr br the end result is like listening to a student political apparatchik droning on and on and on about his views whilst repeatedly kicking you in the head so that you get the message the problem with brecht is if you alienate the audience too much then youve alienated them from what you are trying to convey which always seemed self evident to mebr br the parts that really stick in the craw for this movie though is the contrast between the extremely sexually explicit verbal description of the threesome at the start and the offscreen comical rape in the middle which even if it could be viewed as allegorical completely destroys the films faith in itself and its characters what little of it existed in the first place its so french with a capital f it hurtsbr br watch oh lucky man instead that is a work of genius weekend is a work of pretensionbr br two stars and only for the traffic jam scene and the piano scene which are just hints at genius although they actually make the end result more frustrating and unsatisfying as without them this is a bad film by the,0
my friend and i rented this movie for 399 at blockbuster if id have known how absolutely horrible this movie was going to be i wouldnt have paid a cent i had no warning for this bs the acting cant even be called acting the inevitable sex scene is awkward and you can tell that both girls feel completely uncomfortable doing it and the male villain god who couldnt tell he was going to attack emily and the musical cues my lord this movie makes me want to cry never rent this in fact if you happen to look upon it gauge out your eyeballs this movie isnt of god its from hell im just gonna take the last couple lines to write blah blah blah shiz cause i really dont want to continue on with this review,0

despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt all the major players from the series were present talbot lestat armand maharet khayman pandora mael marius and a halfdozen more albeit most of them in cameo marius lestat and akasha were the main players and jesse of the talamasca also despite other reviews i think this movie and the music was faithful to anne rices portrayal and ethos at least as i perceive it aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene the movie didnt capture the breadth of the books series but i thought it was a nice supplementbr br im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments and i found this movie a faithful and often superlative representation of the authors vision,1
well i bought the zombie bloodbath trilogy thinking it would be mindless gory fun thats what it is without the fun this film truly is mindless it is absent of any plot or character development or any sort of storyline the basic problem with this movie is the kills and gore basically every kill looks exactly the same zombies ripping someone apart yeah thats okay but you need some original kills too i mean it got really lame every kill looked exactly the same filmed exactly the same way thats what killed me i love gore and the gore in this film did nothing for me it was just boring no storyline just the same lame scene over and over again with a different person i wanted to like this movie too i love shot on video gore movieslike redneck zombies but i couldnt kid myself this film has its good points but none of those are in the film i understand that many of the zombies helped out with the flood and there were like over 100 zombies which is pretty cool how they got so many people involved and helped out in the world but overall this is a terrible film,0
seven pounds stars will smith as ben thomas an irs collection agent who has an ulterior motive for meeting those who have gotten behind on their tax payments thomas caused the deaths of seven people whilst driving talking on his phone and the movie follows his attempt to try and atone for his quite frankly unforgivable crimebr br the story line is as subtle as a brick through a green house window what you see is exactly what is happening even the ending of titanic was more surprising when compared to seven pounds there is absolutely no twist whatsoever there is never any confusion or doubt as to what is happeningbr br normally i only like will smith when is in full bad boys mode the guy is at his best when sporting a gun driving a ford gt and saying aw hell nah as whenever he tries to act serious it only comes across as a pathetic attempt at trying to gain an oscar which he is so obviously is desperate for this is probably the main reason why i wasnt looking forward to the movie although here he is very understated there are flashes of comedy but they are subtle in fact it was the most understated will smith performance i have ever seen and for that reason alone he was fantastic and ironically should be nominated for a major awardbr br the supporting cast were all grand too rosario dawson looked pretty much at deaths door the whole film and woody harrelson and barry pepper were fine as where all the other bit playersbr br overall it is a weepy but it isnt throwing all the usual clichés and sentimental violins to give you no other choice but to cry there were a few times that even my hardened heart nearly broke you will be hard pressed not to find one of the situations that does not relate to your own life which makes it seem all the more realbr br i would give it 810 the will smith show moves onto drama without all the desperation of the pursuit of happiness and comes of all the better for it,1
this movie is basically about some girls in a catholic school that end up getting into trouble because of putting red dye in one in one of their school mates shampoo and after being reprimanded for this act they decide to take off to florida for a vacation on their way there they meet up with some guys in a local diner and decide that they would both meet up with each other in another location later on the girls end up on a road side near the woods and stop for awhile and while one of the girls decides to walk around a bit she sees a murder happen in which the local sheriff himself is involved she becomes scared and runs to tell the others what happened the other girls decide to go take a look with her and two of them get killed by the killer then the two remaining girls are caught by the killer and are placed in local jail cell the deputy sheriff meanwhile is keeping watch over the girls and despite their insistence that the sheriff is the killer he ignores them both and acts as ignorant and everybody else in this movie who just cant put two and two together much less some lousy detective work at that the best part was the rape scene between the killer and one of the girls where he decides to rape her in her jail cell and it seems that the girl actually wants to be raped by this man and the bare chest scene i admit was good but before their lips meet he has other things in mind this movie reminds me of the lowbudget thriller blood song with frankie avalon staring in it the same motive just a different character part its not a movie worth renting not even for an 80s lowbudget movie and the ending was the worst ending i have ever seen in a movie and it left me wanting my money back,0
this movie is highly improbable read the other reviews to see whybr br i would say that most of the characters were plastic but they didnt even afford themselves that little luxury they just act like cardboard cutouts of course they had to get real surfers for the surfing contest roles so thats a crap shoot whether they can act at least occy didnt give a crap and just went with it but lance fuhgeddaboutitbr br the one character who rang true was portrayed by gerry lopez who didnt really act he was himself pretty much hes quite accustomed to stomping people the only reason i gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 was because i was laying out a newsletter on my laptop when it came on some cable channel late one night that saved me from having to pay full attention to this silly little time waster no way i would go out of my way to watch it,0

many many spoilers in this review this movie was horrible i am a huge baseball fan so i thought id watch it and i was very disappointed it started out okay when i saw the bad influence deniro had on his young son i was hoping that he would become a better father throughout the movie or something anyways at the beginning it seemed as if deniro was supposed to be the protagonist he was the only one that believed in bobby and he had his adorable son that he was losing custody of which gave me a reason to feel bad for him he wanted to help bobby by talking to primo when out of absolutely nowhere he brutally stabs primo to death not to mention that sketchy reoccurring song i want to you at random unfitting momentsbr br later when deniro saves bobbys son from drowning i was hoping that the movie could redeem itself he could forgive himself for killing primo if he saved bobbys son but of course this is far beyond the depth of the movie because all he cares about is getting credit for the murder and does so by stealing bobbys son car and dog and holding them hostage bobby just has to hit a home run and announce that deniro is a true fan while displaying a picture of him biting a knifebr br now we get to the completely unrealistic scene at the end it is pouring like hell and we are expected to believe that the game hasnt been called then deniro somehow magically appears on the field in an umpire suit and calls bobby out at home proceeding to pull out his knife and start stabbing everyone that runs onto the field there are seemingly no officers on the field but the police are on their way so deniro steps on the mound and prepares to pitch a knife to bobby when he gets shot to death but dont worry this cheerful and pleasant movie has a happy ending because bobby find his sonbr br this is not a sports movie it is not about a fan as far as i know fans are not rabid psychopaths that threaten rob and throw knives at their admirees this is likely to be the sickest movie i will ever see in my life the plot was shallow the soundtrack sucked the movie had no purpose whatsoever i warn you not to waste your time on this disgusting excuse for a film,0
im watching this horrid film as we speak it is possibly one of the worst movies ever aired in my house im sitting here with 3 friends and they agree its not scary its not funny its not dramatic it contains nothing appealing whatsoever we are 49 minutes in the movie weve only seen 2 critters only one person has died this movie is one big letdown nothing about this horrible horrible movie has made me want to watch the rest im getting a movie hang over i hope that everyone who had anything to do with making this movie dies i dont just mean the actors i mean the director producers the presidents from the studio that financed this movie it is in full the worst movie ever it should make the imdb worst 100 movies of all time at number 1,0
well maybe not immediately before the rodney king riots but even a few months before was timely enough my parents said that they saw it and the next thing you know the police got acquitted and la got burned to the ground it just goes to show the state of race relations in america the plot has white mack kevin kline and africanamerican simon danny glover becoming friends after simon saves macks life in the black ghetto meanwhile movie producer davis steve martin in a serious role thinks that gratuitous violence is really cooluntil he gets shot theres also some existentialism in the movie mack and his family come to realize that they arent living as they really wantbr br it seems that crash has somewhat renewed peoples interest in race relations but this one came out much earlier maybe well never be able to have stable race relations in this country but either way grand canyon is a great movie it affirms kevin kline as my favorite actor also starring mary mcdonnell marylouise parker and alfre woodard,1

yesterday i finally satisfied my curiosity and saw this movie my knowledge of the plot was limited to about 60 seconds of the trailer but i had heard some good critics which caused my expectations to increasebr br as i saw the movie those untied pieces had been combined in a story that was becoming quite intriguing with some apparently inexplicable details but in the end everything is disclosed as a simple succession of events of bad luck sorte nula in portuguese above everything i felt that the story made sense and everything fits in its place properties of a good scriptbr br i must also mention the soundtrack which helps the creation of an amazing environmentbr br and if you think of the resources fernando fragata used to make this film i believe it will make many hollywood producers envious,1
one of several musicals about sailors on leave it is the usual sailor meets girl complications ensue sorted out happily kind of plot it proceeds along smoothly enough but it does drag in places too the dialogue is not as zippy as top hat for example and randolph scott seems out of placebr br there are compensations it has some of irving berlins choicest songs including let yourself go im putting all my eggs in one basket and lets face the music and dance it has fred and ginger who when they are dancing take any film into heavenly heights and they dont disappoint here they do a snappy tap dance a knockabout comic dance and a swirling graceful dance all in the same film great versatility and artistrybr br it also has harriet hilliard who is rather good in her role she had a varied career becoming the more famous harriet nelson with ozzie here she is touching without being sentimentalher two songs are simply and effectively delivered she makes a good contrast with ginger but you can believe they are sisters in the film br br more tightening up have made the film even better pretty good though,1
but i still enjoyed watching her so i gave it a 3 instead of a 1 her expressions are priceless some of the other cast members eg michael mckean are really slumming too the cat himself is somewhat amusing aside from that the movie is all cliche culminating in a muchtoolong car chase its also at this point that the movie becomes unnecessarily crude having been very family until then,0
there is something about pet sematary that i never felt anywhere else maybe the fact i was a kid when i first watched it made this experience so memorable but as i keep watching it over and over again it never gets old and i never get bored from the opening credits with that creepy opening song to the very chaotic ending there is something insane sad and scary at the same time and it keeps ringing in your head sometimes dead is better br br i dont think it would be useful to relate the whole story again all you need to know is it starts from point a the most perfect situation for a happy american family and step by step drowns to point b which is believe me the very end of all joy the music is perfect the story makes sense the special effects are cool and the pet sematary is the last place on earth i would be like i said sometimes dead is better,1

there is not much of a plot to this movie there is a wealthy baseball team owner who dies and whose wife is going to sue the hospital for neglience not much more than that but it does not matterbr br it does not matter because you have some real actors giving their dialogue life and because of the cast you have yourself some hysterically funny scenes and even if youre not cracking up laughing you have a smile on your face br br matthau plays charley whose wife recently passed away and who finds himself the object of desire of several women at the hospital he is delighted to taste everything on the menu available to him then he meets anne atkinson glenda jackson who at first is a patient in the hospital their first scene together is very funny and then they meet up again on a television panel discussion show where they disagree on nearly every topic that is discussed br br charley begins to like anne and viceversa except that she is very big on monogamy in the men in her life her husband was a cheater and they decide to give it a shot two weeks of faithfulness br br i will not give away anything else but i want to mention the chemistry that matthau and jackson have on screen she is usually not the first person anyone would think of for a romantic middleaged comedy but her touch with comedy is very light and agreeable she is matched every step of the way by matthau who is more charming than ever he does not have to play mr sensitive or mr macho to get the girl he just has to be himself br br art carney is a riot all by himself as a practically senile doctor the scene where the baseball team owners ashes are buried at home plate is priceless he also has a very funny scene in a parking lot with richard benjamin richard does not have much to do in this movie and more often than not is just the straight man to carney and matthau the role does not tax his considerable talents but he had to have had a good time making this comedy br br very much recommended810br br ps fyi matthau presented jackson with her first best actress oscar and jackson presented best actor to art carney for his role in harry tonto,1
terry gilliam traveled again to the future he had already done it in brazil to tell this story about a virus thats destroying the human racebr br the script is totally crazy with some easy tricks on it but its quite entertaining and gilliam proves that hes got imagination the futuristic scenes are just great as for the cast bruce willis and the beautiful madeleine stowe whatever happened to her are just ok but brad pitt is so annoying whenever he plays roles that are out of his hand he results so forced and hes not credible at all he should just play goodlooking successful young menbr br my rate 710,1

lucio fulci was one of the most prolific italian directors by the time of his death in 1996 yet his career had long since descended into a downward spiral of increasingly futile genre entries that could barely stand in the shadow of his earlier work for much of the 70s into the mid80s he cranked out such stylistically distinctive horrors as city of the living dead the beyond and the brutal giallo the new york ripper fondly remembered by fans like myself and while cat in the brain falls in with the era of fulcis decline as a filmmaker it is a shocking darkly hilarious headtrip that while a clearly inferior work the framing effects and acting are below par proves an interesting openended meditation on pop psychology and films ability to desensitize make no mistake cat in the brain is a total gorefest and as disjointed as fulcis previous films but it deserves credit for trying to be something more in a deliciously tongueincheek touch fulci plays himself a director in the midst of filming yet another violent horror flick who comes down with perversemurderous hallucinations after visiting a shrink who puts him under hypnosis his dreams and reality begin to intersect to the point where the viewer cannot discern the two the recent dvd from grindhouse releasing mentions cat as an heir apparent to the likes of eraserhead and it does carry a similarly disquieting awkwardly funny quality associated with the best surrealist art,1

i have lately got into the habit of purchasing any interesting dvd that the criterion company releases i figure that even if i dislike the movie criterion usually supplies enough extra material to compensate for any shortcomings in the actual film i read up on them and i buy the ones which are the most interesting to mebr br le million is my latest purchase and i must say that i was not disappointed in the film it is cheery funny and romantic everything about it is quite excellent the songs are wonderful if i understood french i would probably hum them and sing them all day long the acting is very good for this kind of movie american musicals of the classic hollywood era relied more on song and dance than the actual characters and story but in le million the characters are rather well developed and the story while not being anything extremely impressive is not at all lacking i loved the developments of the relationships especially the relationship between the once best friends michel and prosper the romantic moments are also very well developed the direction is nearly perfect with several very memorable moments probably the single most perfect scene of the film occurs right after the lead couple has an argument they hide on the stage of an opera performance and the opera singers sing lines which the couple michel and beatrice interpret to their own situation this is definitely one of the high points in cinema history the scene managed to make me laugh to win me over with a very sweet romance and make me smirk at just how clever the director was i give this film a 910br br ps some information for anyone who has the same faith in criterion that i do and is planning to buy it amongst the criterion discs i now own le million contains the fewest features all it has is a photo gallery not all that useful one might flip through it once and a rare television interview with rene clair the director this piece is of some interest he was one of the many directors who had started out in silent film and when talkies were first appearing he said that they represented the death of film i think most filmsavvy people understand what these directors meant when they said that but it is interesting to hear him explain it also if you have read the description of this movie on amazoncom please note that they were wrong in one important respect not every line in the film is sung in fact it contains no more songs than a regular musical it is actually a lot more like a chaplin or buster keaton or marx brothers film my criticisms of the disc are not that important heck criterion has the right to smack me around for making those complaints the fact is their people probably spent hundreds of hours fixing up a film which only 20 now 21 people have voted for on imdb and only about,1
this movie has remained in my mind for years as one of the best madefortv movie mysteries ive ever seen the acting is superb ive seen it twice and still am puzzled at some parts id love to have a copy so i can play certain parts over and over again i am interested in buying a copy of this movie but cannot find it anywherei am wondering if if anyone has any suggestions how to find it ive tried ebay amazoncom internet searches and am completely frustrated ive not seen it on turner classic movies nor on american movie classics and i have even put out fliers in our community asking if anyone has a copy,1

as a physically challenged person god how i hate that phrase i just happened to catch this on cable where there was absolutely nothing else to watch overall it was a fantastic movie yes i was a little disappointed upon finding out that neither actor is disabled and yes i was a little disappointed that more of the movie wasnt filmed from the true point of view of the disabled can you imagine what its like always being the tallest person in the room and then having to live the rest of your life with a view of nothing but other peoples asses and crotches having to always wait for the idiot to stop reading the newspaper in the only handicapped stall enduring everyone elses rude bodily expulsions while you wait and the scene with him driving the car was absolutely me been there done that literally but the movie was true enough to matter while ive never lived in a home or assisted residence there were plenty of times throughout the movie where i found myself nodding and saying to myself yeah thats true thats happened to me what impressed me is that some of the commentors on this board expressed the fact that the movie made them view life a little differently and with a little more insight as the lives of a silent minority cant ask more than that out of a movie that it makes you think and view life differently so by virtue of that alone the movies was tremendously successful should be required viewing of every kid in junior high schoolbr br pretty much for every person thats severely physically disabled independence is one of if not the most important focus of our daily lives from working to socializing to recreating for those of you who felt the movie was cliched try living our life for a single day youll see that the movie was cliched because its true the challenges the actors faced only skimmed the surface of what happens to us every day if were lucky we experience the same emotional and personal growth that the three characters including the girl did every day presents obstacles for us to overcome its just that theres no swelling dramatic music to accompany our lives unless its in our ipods lol,1
this film was shrouded in scandal for so long that it became a very sought after itemthe outrage the mystery etc it had everything to be a great piece of filmmaking but ultimately fails in every extent its a terribly bad comedy a pathetic horror movie a lame erotic filmbr br the 2 disc dvd includes a gorgeous booklet with stills interviews essays on bestiality etc as well as an extensive interview with the morethanpretentious director for those who have heard about it but never seen it the package will seem fantastic until one actually sees the film disc 1 contains the edited film badly translated to english but with good visual quality disc 2 contains the directors cut in an awful transfer in frenchbr br what can i say about the actual beast a hand puppet of kermit the frog would have been more effective and shocking,0
rosie perez is the lead in this very engaging affair cast as mercedes a young woman from brooklyn who has resolved to become a film actress although not favoured by her circumstances living in east los angeles and struggling with a series of fruitless auditions for any sort of part at all mercedes has hooked up with a married and washedup actor harry harrelson harvey keitel who at one time had performed in a television western series during the 1970s and seldom since accepting him as her lover in part from loneliness and as well from a hope that film parts will be coming her way because of his contacts but these latter are of small consequence as harry is simply selfdelusional in his attempts at recovering what he perceives as past cinematic renown in order to adequately support herself financially mercedes toils as a taxi dancer in a downtown los angeles skid row dance hallbar while she continues carrying on her efforts to succeed at the motion picture business and it is while there at the dance palace that a young immigrant from mexico ernesto michael delorenzo falls in love with her and the largest portion of the narrative depicts his efforts to please the object of his affections even if they may mean losing her altogether this essentially tradition rooted melodrama is given only a moderate budget despite the presence of a goodly number of wellknown players including steve buscemi anthony quinn and stanley tucci and was kept in the can for about a year before its rather desultory distribution and leaden marketing efforts on its behalf mores the pity as its solid production characteristics are firmly complemented by alexandre rockwells admirably controlled direction a consistent virtue of his work and on display in this film from its very opening scene frames that form a montage behind the credits featuring perez at skid rows fifth and main streets rockwell has often demonstrated that he operates very closely indeed with his cast and this holds true in this instance as he allows his actors to create their roles while any ad libbing is neatened nicely via the editing process resulting in an artistic success for the director despite negative comments from some mainstream evaluators the films scoring is aesthetically spot on with a good deal of it contributed by tito larriva who also plays as band boss for the taxi dancers acting honours here must go to the ever vital perez although nary a subpar performance is turned in a fair test for any films quality is given when a viewer will watch it twice within a brief period sitting through this undervalued work will be considered a keen pleasure for many,1
very bad very very bad as a fellow who aspires to make be in or at least sniff the catering table at a movie set i find it hard to criticize independents who actually got a movie of any sort made however this movie oh dearbr br realizing frightworld doesnt aspire to anything more than crude exploitation an honorable thing in itself and to try to make it conform to more mainstream standards is a mistake and to be fair it is more entertaining than say red zone cuba but not by much so i wont try to critique just let me ask throw out some observationsbr br 1 if gore is the point of the movie shouldnt you be able to see itbr br 2 if you have hire three sound men make sure at least one knows how to operate the equipmentbr br 3 in a horror movie your lead maniac must be scarier than a smurf doll difficult i know but reallybr br 4 there is a lot of talented videographers in the buffalorochester area most you can hire really cheap get one who knows how to frame a scenebr br 5 just because you have someone who knows how to use after effects and other cool programs doesnt mean he should do so every two secondsbr br 6 kudos for getting the girls to take off their tops but next time get girls whos tops we want to see taken offbr br 7 editing should help tell the story or set a mood at the least in this sort of movie editing should sell the gore gags a chainsaw suddenly appearing in a characters stomach is not scary its sloppybr br some good things not all the acting was bad jack was pretty good and i liked acid once she started fighting back there was some neat imagery unfortunately it was thrown up on the screen without rhyme or reason acid poptart is a name that deserves a better movie i like the moxie of frightworld too next time now that they have a movie of sorts under their belts i hope all involve aspire to something better than colman francis upgrade at least ed wood,0
it was a fun film to look at though the chance this happened in your street is small there are still a lot off recognizable situations that will ring a bell the simplicity of the film and the humour do work i must admit that you dont have to see it in a theater it will do very well on a small tvset tip see it with some close friends,1
yes this review may contain spoilers but youll thank me for it this is the worst film ive seen in quite some time i came to this board expecting to see the same response i had but inexplicably there are several people who love this film and spaceys performance in particularbr br some will chastise me for saying it but i find kevin spaceys acting quite limited despite the worlds admiration for him i felt like i was watching a meaner version of kevins american beauty role his character in this film is ridiculously overacted all the way down to his laughable insults he throws at his assistantbr br there are allworld trite and boring scenes like when spacey is tearing into whaley about bringing him equal instead of sweat and low somehow i suspected this particular scene was supposed to be funny but by this time i was ready to hit the stop button this is approximately 20 minutes into the filmbr br what about the fauxhomage to resevoir dogs whaley proclaims i think i saw this in a movie once as if hes going to cut off spaceys ear but what does he use to cut him an envelope thats right hes going to give him paper cuts that has to be one of hollywoods alltime worst scenes and the fact that the actors and director tried to carry it out with a straight face makes it even more appallingbr br i will admit that i didnt see the end of this film my dvd mercifully locked up about a half hour before the end but anyone who wishes to say so could spare me the line that i missed a great twist and everything would have made sense well i dont care what happened in the end because it could never make up for all that bad acting and relentlessly overthetop dialogue i even got the feeling that the actors themselves wanted to get out of this film as bad as i did,0
i absolutely hate it when a film completely falls apart near the end after youve already invested an hour into it and thats what happened with this film i was intrigued by its actors and the fact that malamud wrote its source story i havent gone to read that story but i cannot imagine that it ends like this film endsfortunately i didnt pay good money to see or rent it because my library had it ohhhh such a waste of excellent acting the wife in particular was so perfectbut milo oshea as a jew now that was funny i havent researched into its making but it played like the director lost his marbles or died 34 of the way through the film before that point a story and characters were developingthere were a number of neat plot points and there wasnt too much time wasted but ooh that last 12 hour if that wasnt the screwiest most worthless denouement ive ever witnessed i dont know what is i just hate it when ones faith is so destroyed like that it feels like an act of violence,0
ill start by admitting that i enjoy many movies that have low ratings on this site i find that if i can see what the creators were trying to do i can find appreciation for their work sound of thunder was a story that interested me i wanted to see what angles the filmmakers would attack in telling the story by and large they attempted to create an entertaining movie the plot was contrived but most action movies plots are ed burns doesnt know how to carry a rifle but still holds his own well as an action lead considering he isnt asked for much the main problem destroys the whole movie is the horrible cgi it is totally unacceptable for the animals and backgrounds to look soooooo very fake aside from that the animal conceptions could have been really good as could the action scenes but failed because the production failed this could have been a really memorable film if they had only finished it it really looks like they meant to go back and fix all the horrible cgi but ran out of money and still released it save your money because someone failed this movie i give it three stars because it really could have been good but was totally failed somewhere i cant say it enough,0
this movie was excellent it details the struggle between a committed detective against the dedicated ignorance of the corrupted communist regime in russia during the 80s i give this movie high marks for its noholdsbarred look into the birth and development of forensic investigation in a globally isolated thanks to the regime community this is a graphic movie it presents an unsensationalized picture of violence and its tragic remains nothing is candycoated with overdone blood or gore to separate us from the cruel reality on the screen this movie is based on russian serial killer andrei chikatilo im familiar enough with the true story to have a very deep appreciation for how real they kept the film its not a comedy but for those who appreciate dry and dark humor this movie is a mustsee,1

ouch what a painfully boring scifi movie and thats especially saddening because the opening 15 minutes were so actionpacked and full of potential during the intro we follow a bunch of nervous security officers and hired hit men as they chase a doctor who escaped from a mysterious laboratory with a briefcase full of topsecret files as hes about to reveal the supposedly horrible inhuman events that take place in the lab hes executed figures from then on the action swifts back and forth between two locations the aforementioned laboratory and the rural mansion of a corrupt senator or something and it quickly becomes clear that the experiments are actually the complete opposite of disturbing more like dull pointless and vague scientists selected four random persons without living relatives and its really really really really important that they speak the truth even though a giant machine reads the content of their minds anyway they all hide dark secrets from their pasts and people suffer when get revealed yet i fail to see how these tests could ever result in a humanitythreatening device perhaps i missed something but i doubt it the interactions between the patients and doctors are even less interesting to follow as really none of them have personalities so basically the brain machine just handles about a bunch of lame people living in an awfully decorated room the film also could have been half an hour shorter if it werent for a thousand stagnant shots of buildings the relocations from the lab to the villa and vice versa are indicated every single time by a fivesecond shot of the places either the makers really needed the padding or they just assumed that all scifi viewers are morons unable to notice a change of location by themselves staring at a forsaken pool with a mansion in the background for the tenth time in only five minutes becomes quite annoying i assure you james bests performance as the reverend with mental issues is rather decent but one man definitely cant save this thing from being an absolute waste of time avoid,0
this one of the best celebritys reality shows a ever saw we can see the concerts we can see the life of britney i love the five episodes i was always being surprised by britney and the subjects of the show i think that some people dont watch the show at all we can how a great person she his she his really funny really gentle and she loves her fans and we can see how she loves her work i just dont give a 10 because of kfed he his a real jerk he doesnt seem to like britney at all i they make a second season of this great show because it shows at some people how britney really is go britney your the best and you will never leave our hearts,0
what ever possessed martin scorcese to remake this film and not only did he remake it completely ruin it the nonsensical decision to make the character played by robert deniro in his most overdone performance and thats saying a lot into a religious fanatic is ridiculous and exemplary of attitudes harbored by hollywood and mr scorcese especially attitudes that compel writers to think that the best way to make a character insane is to tattoo a crucifix on his back in any case this movie is awful br br,0

by no means a masterpiece and far from errol flynns best istanbul still has much going for it the locations and beautiful technicolour cinematography bring us back to a time long since past errol flynn does show moments of his past glory and is ok as jim brennan a pilot whos past comes back to haunt him the picture is actually a remake of 1947s singapore and the story seems awfully contrived and cliche by todays standards also many of the supporting cast seem to be simply going through the motions in this picture many people have also compared it to one of the all time greats casablanca while watching the film i could see many of the similarities but hey casablanca has inspired countless imitators so take that for what its worth in closing if you are a fan of flynn or old fashioned love stories you might want to give this film a look otherwise id recommend casablanca or the maltese falcon as a good introduction to some of hollywoods classics,1

its good to see that vintage film buff have correctly categorized their excellent dvd release as a musical for thats what this film is pure and simple like its unofficial remake murder at the windmill 1949 the murder plot is just an excuse for an elaborate girlie show with kitty carlisle and gertrude michael leading a cast of superdecorative girls including ann sheridan lucy ball beryl wallace gwenllian gill gladys young barbara fritchie wanda perry and dorothy white carl brisson is also on hand to lend his strong voice to cocktails for two undoubtedly the movies most popular song it is heard no less than four times however its gertrude michael who steals the show not only with her rendition of sweet marijauna but her strong performance as the heros rejected girlfriend as for the rest of the cast we could have done without jack oakie and victor mclaglen altogether the only good thing about oakies role is his weak running gag with cult icon toby wing in fact to give you an idea as to how far the rest of the comedy is overindulged and overstrained superdumb inspector mclaglen simply cannot put his hands on the killer even though would you believe in this instance it happens to be the person you most suspect director mitch leisen actually goes to great pains to point the killer out to even the dumbest member of the cinema audience by giving the player concerned closeup after closeup,1
this story focuses on the birth defect known as fas or fetal alcohol syndrome a disease diagnosed too often among native americans in spite of the downbeat nature of this drama the great script and the characterizations move the story along very well this is arguably smits best performance,1

this is a very enjoyable fluffy glamorous musical from the 40s cover girl made rita hayworth formerly the darkhaired latin senorita margarita cansino into a bonafide allamerican star it confirmed gene kellys amazing talent as a dancer singer actor and choreographer it epitomises the exuberance and colour of the musical genrebr br rita hayworth is great as rusty parker it is her picture and her presence is always at the forefront her singing is dubbed but her dancing is absolutely brilliant and she combines very well with kelly i think that rita was highly underrated as an actress she plays every scene superbly here gene choreographed the dance sequences he was basically given almost complete creative freedom here and his alter ego dance number is amazing such artistry the standout tunes are make way for tomorrow put me to the test and of course long ago and far away the plot is rather thin yet it does have a moral its about the perils of quick fame and fast money and how any happiness with only these factors will ultimately be doomed this will cheer you up lift you up to your feet and make you laughbr br that said cover girl is not the greatest musical ever produced it has a number of flaws that must be addressed one can say that a little bit of phil silvers goes a long way his character gets tedious rather quickly however i was impressed with his dancing ability and how he was able to keep up with gene and rita another major problem is that too many songs are just not that great the cover girl number looks fantastic but im not a fan of the lyrics or the singing poor tom is a huge downer i think its one of the worst numbers ive heard in a 40s50s musical yet it stinks the grandmother subplot borders on being ridiculous but thats only my opinion others may like these elementsbr br still apart from its faults its a very very good film much better than most of the product churned out today the dancing and singing is sublime the production values are excellent and its mood is infectiousbr br 810,1

a lawyer is drawn into a deadly game of cat and mouse when he becomes involved with a femme fatale in this adaptation of a grisham novel altman creates a suspenseful gothic atmosphere but the script is weak sporting a southern drawl branagh is convincing as the lawyer and davidtz is alluring as the object of his desire downey is likable as a private detective duvall has a small role which does not allow him to do much with his weird character hannah and berenger round out the impressive cast after an interesting setup the film bogs down and does not really deliver on its initial promise but altman is always worth a look,1
i have to agree with the other two comments i waited over a month to see this great new show ae had been hyping what a disappointment the show is pretty much all about ryan buell his voiceovers are campy not creepy it sounds as if he is talking into a can as of the second episode which is roughly 30 minutes or so if you take out the commercials he is being chased or followed by something that he knows is demonic he cant say the name anytime someone needs to convey that name they write it on a piece of paper and hand it to someone else not particularly informative or entertaining or believable for the rest of us why cant he say the namesupposedly it would give the demon more power funny i always thought demons wanted to hide their true identities if you know the exact name of the demon doesnt it make it easier for you to cast them out now the next episode which airs in just a little while is titled exorcism so is ryan in need of an exorcism already not to say that it couldnt happen but the show so far has not given any evidence or proof of anything i can tell ryan that if i were a small child hell if i was an adult and someone gave me a little bottle of holy water to chase away something that was terrifying me i would look elsewhere for help besides which if you dont use holy water blessings etc in the right way dont you risk just further infuriating whatever is already mad at you i will probably watch tonight but if these episodes are as ridiculous as the first it will probably be the last time i watch it,0
this was a excellent movie i deal with a child who i am raising that has fae and watching this movie was more than word can explain i also purchased the book and it was great i would like to have a copy for my own use and so i can have my sons teachers watch it alsoi would like to know if anyone could sell me a copy of this movie let me use it for a time or refer me to someone where i could purchase it thank you myra i would recommend this movie to anyone who deal with childrenadults with special abilitys this movie should be shown again on tv the team of doctors that have been tracking my son would also like to have a copy his special ed teacher has also asked me to try to locate a copy that he can have or that he can borrowbr br thank you,1
it may or may not be considered interesting that the only reason i really checked out this movie in the first place was because i wanted to see the performance of the man who beat out humphrey bogart in his casablanca 1010 role for the best actor oscar i still would have given the oscar to bogie but paul lukas did do a great job and deserved the nomination at least well im glad i did check this movie out because i enjoyed it immensely i think the movie did preach a little but not only did i not mind i enjoyed the speeches and was never bored with thembr br the acting was outstanding in this movie i especially enjoyed paul lukas lucile watson rightfully nominated for an oscar bette davis wrongfully not nominated george coulouris and oddly eric roberts who plays the middle child i really enjoyed his character an oddlooking boy who talks like some sort of philosopher he just cracks me up even the characters name bodo is funny br br the ending in which lukass character was forced to do something he considered wrong even though he was doing it for all the right reasons worked for me as well i agreed with why he felt he had to what he did and i understood why he couldnt quite explain it the message this movie makes is a good and noble one the scenery meaning the house is beautiful and the acting is the excellent watch this movie if you ever get a chancebr br 910,1
the movie opens with a meteor crashing into a lake unbeknownst to the locals a dinosaur egg is also at the bottom of the lake the meteor heats the lake turning it into a giant incubator you guessed it the egg hatches releasing a dinosaur that proceeds to terrorize the communitybr br what utter garbage its not that i mind the stopmotion clay dinosaur its everything else about the movie that bothers me the acting is atrocious the dialogue is utterly ridiculous the comic relief is anything but comic logic is nonexistent any similarity between the scientists in this movie and an actual scientist is purely coincidental i could go on for an eternity on the bad aspects of this movie but you get the idea i feel its fairly safe to call this disaster mst3k worthy,0

it was almost worth sitting through this entire godawful film just to know that i can never experience anything as bad as this again acting 0 script 0 fight scenes 0 male lead 0 cheddar bob from eight mile as a suave war hero who gets the girl nadia bjorlin 10 she is gorgeous and not a terrible actress this is the criteria i used to average it out to a two i lost count but i believe ever movie cliché ever is in this movie when the driver that supposedly killed her father miraculously shows up at the end to race against her from out of nowhere it cemented the previous statement plus he just shows up for no reason he was never even mentioned before i dont know what else to say here just watch it when it comes out on tv in a couple years at least that way some of it will be edited out for commercials,0
the only time i ever actually laugh while watching this show is when im making fun of it jamie lynn spears only got the acting job because of her big sister and i dont think anyone could argue with me on that there is no expression in her face ever even when she smiles just watch the show and youll see what i mean now lets talk about the show zoey 101 is one of the most unrealistic shows ive ever seen as a lot of people have already said zoey brooks is absolutely perfect everyone loves her shes a straight a student and all the boys think that shes hot pca is a boarding school full of rich kids that gives all their students flatscreen tvs and laptop computers serving kids sushi from the sushi bar in one of the newest episodes zoey is completely clueless and thinks that chase is not in love with her and acts as if she doesnt even want chase to love her then when she barges into chases dorm room to prove her friends wrong she finds chase kissing this girl named rebecca zoey of course freaks out probably because she likes the attention from chase anyway only watch this show if you have nothing else to do and the only thing on television is zoey 101 you can at least have fun laughing at how unrealistic it is,0
i was raised watching the original batman animated series and am an avid batman graphic novel collector with a comic book hero as iconic as batman there are certain traits that cannot be changed creative liberties are all well and good but when it completely changes the character then it is too far i purchased one of the seasons of the batman in the hopes that an extra bonus feature could shed some light on the creators reasoning for making this show such an atrocity in an interview on the making of the batman one of the artists or writers im unsure which said that we felt we shouldnt mess with batman but we could mess with the villains so they proceeded to make the joker into an immature little kid begging for attention the penguin into some anime knockoff mr freeze into a superpowered jewel thief poison ivy into a teenage hippie and countless other shameful acts which are making bob kane roll over in his grave br br to sum it all up i wish i had more hands so i could give this show four thumbs down it squeezes by my rating with a 2 out of 10 simply because it uses the batman name warner brosrethink this please,0

im sure that operations dames was a favorite at the driveins back in the day theres absolutely nothing in the way of a plot that you might miss if you were otherwise preoccupied and if you needed to get in the mood for other activities you did have some curvaceous cuties on screen to get you in the moodbr br otherwise there aint a whole lot that operations dames has going for it its set in the korean war where a platoon of gis together with a british tommy gets a little too far forward and has to get back to the un lines bad enough already but these guys also come across a stranded bunch of uso girls and their choreographer in the same predicamentbr br you know whats sad about this film is that it took women generations to finally get accepted in the army and in combat situations these bimbos from the uso set womens liberation back light years in fact not even the hard bitten professional soldier who is the sergeant in charge of these men can keep it in his pantsbr br but that was probably the better to remind some what they were at the drivein for this no name cast is better off with me not recognizing any of them for any individual effortbr br operations dames is definitely a team flop,0
well then what is it i found nicholsons character shallow and most unfortunately uninteresting angelica hustons character drained my power and kathleen turner is a filthy no good slut its not that i dont get it its not that i dont think that some of the ideas couldve lead to something more this is a film with nothing but the notion that were supposed to accept these ideas and thats what the movie has going for it that nicholson falls for turner is absurd but then again it is intended to be so this however does not strike me as afunny or beven remotely interesting this was a waste of my time so dont let the hype get the best of youit is a waste of your time with all that being said the opening church sequence is quite beautiful,0
i had to register for imdb just to post a comment on just how awful this movie ismy cats and a ball of string have a better storyline than this not the worst acting ive ever seen but when you wipe out almost the entire cast of the movie within 5 minutes it leaves a bit to be desired there wasnt a single scare moment in the movie with the exception of when they were watching the movie halloween on the tv all around it seems like it couldve been a good story rolling the credits and saying that chasey lain was in it was a bit of a loss as i didnt recognize her right away and her scene was already over before i couldve said oh yeah there she is im so glad i saw this in a hotel and didnt pay for it as id be real ticked if i had payed a cent to see this i normally like or can at least find a redeeming factor in a movie but this one is an exception its so bad that its not even that amusing sogooditsbadits just plain bad,0
hubert selby jr gave us the book requiem for a dream and cowrote the screenplay to aronofskys movie of it that movie succeeded on every level by delivering an intimate and unbiased portrait of the horrors of the characters lives and the vices that destroyed them last exit to brooklyn still has the vice and the multiple characters living sad lives but it hardly does them the same justice aronofsky didbr br the film seems laughably antigay at times especially when in the film homosexuality equals death one gay character gets stoned is launched skyward by a speeding car and lands dead on the pavement another is crucified and still more are simply beat up another exaggerated piece of shock value that might actually have been compelling if it were done well are scenes of the union workers literally doing battle with the strikebreakers whod have thought a drama about brooklyners would feature action sequences and truck explosionsbr br the director uli edel has a skill level like that of a tv director but he is far below the cut for real movies the film is clunky that cant even seem to settle on a genre lake is given a useless role that any mannequin could have filled and baldwin only seems to know how to look stupid in his equally meager part and then comes jennifer jason leigh as our lead a loathsome hooker named tralala believe it or not im not joking her performance is nothing great and the fate of her character is dirty to say the least poor use of color and composition make it look cheaper than it is and also takes the real edge off the more provocative bits a failure,0
three russian aristocrats soak up the decadence of monte carlo despite the fact they are down to their last franc in order to support their lavish lifestyle the three use the services of a counterfeiter and use the notes at the casinos hoping to exchange the bogus currency for a jackpot andrew hughes a us envoy arrives at monaco with his wife helen and the three decide to make pals with the visitors hoping for financial assistance one of the three russians count sergius karamzin plans to go further with continuous advance towards helen while disappointing the counts maid who loves sergius eventually circumstances play their hand against the three aristocrats its obvious that von stroheim was trying to convey a message with the foolishness of american women and the improper behaviors of the aristocrats rather than tell a story and the film really can bore modern audiences like me easily by doing that even the acting which is great in later evs like greed and the wedding march is just run of the mill here the film could have used improvements on various levels rating 3,0
power play starts off interesting but it goes down hill fast the only good actor is tobin bell and he has a very small part beyond bell power play has no redeeming value or interest power play has more earthquakes in a few days than california has in a year the earthquake scene in the mall is so contrived and completely unbelievable and all the action scenes look like a bunch of third graders putting on a play its awful simply awfulbr br bottom line if power play was made in the 60s or 70s it would be considered a poor b class movie the fact that power play was made in 2001 is really sad is there such a thing as a d class movie if so power play casts the mold,0
les visiteurs the first movie about the medieval time travelers was actually funny i like jean reno as an actor but there was more there were unexpected twists funny situations and of course plain absurdness that would remind you a little bit of louis de funesbr br now this sequel has the same characters the same actors in great part and the same time traveling the plot changes a little since the characters now are supposed to be experienced time travelers so they jump up and down in history without paying any attention to the fact that it keeps getting absurder as you advance in the movie the duke jean reno tries to keep the whole thing together with his playing but his character has been emptied so theres not a lot he can do to save the filmbr br now the dukes slavehelper he has really all the attention the movie is merely about him and his being clumsy annoying stupid or whatever he was supposed to be fact is this character tries to produce the laughter from the audience but he does not succeed it is as if someone was telling you a really very very bad joke you already know but he insists on telling that joke till the end adding details to make your suffering a little longerbr br if you liked les visiteurs do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel if you didnt like les visiteurs you would never consider seeing the sequel if you liked this sequel well i suppose you still need to see a lot of movies,0
if you want scream or anything like the bigstudio horror product that we get forced on us these days dont bother this wellwritten film kept me up thinking about all it had to say importance of myth in our lives to make it make sense how children interpret the world and the violence in it our ransacking of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends all here but not flatly on the surface you could technically call it a monster movie even though the wendigo does not take physical form until the end and then its even up to you and your beliefs as to whats happening with the legendary spiritbeast some standard thriller elements for those looking just for the basics and the film never bores though in fact the less you see of the creature the better fessenden successfully continues george romeros tradition of using the genre as parable and as a discussion forum while still keeping us creeped out,1
i really enjoyed this movie i have probably watched it 2 dozen times or more and still enjoy it being an old navy guy im still stirred by the rousing rendition of anchors away i also love the mchales navy pirate atmosphere i could have done without the female dive officer but im just old fashioned i guess she was still good to look at lol espesially after the crew got done with her laundry the cook sonarman and electrician made the movie loved the salty old engineer and his first class po too and grammer actually did a very commendable job of being a misfit officer i loved the driving scene as they passed the golf course on the way into port lol pure navy and i swear i had an xo that was just like that little weasel im am so glad this is out on dvd about bloody time 0,1

i just cant see what everyone sees in this movie the acting is just awful the choice of music is mildly putting it peculiar there arent enough fighting scenes the plot is nonexistent and whatever small entertainment one could get from this film is ruined by the annoying way some of the movie is filmed and gives you a splitting headace,0
haggard the movie is well written well directed and well acted there are many laugh out loud moments and some terrific skateboarding scenes featuring margera the scenes of west chester pa are filmed beautifully and the script is just downright funny what i like about the movie is that instead of being another sappy love story or another version of jackass it takes a darkly funny look at breakups from a different perspective most breakup films feature a naive woman jilted by a cheating man she then goes on to find mr right and gets to tell her cheating ex to get lost this movie takes a look at the emotional rollercoaster of a jilted man without taking itself too seriously ryan dunn does an excellent job as the jilted man and with bam margera and brandon dicamillo as your best friends trying to help you through this rough time how can you take anything too seriously it is obvious that margera and co are incredibly talented both behind and in front of the camera i look forward to their future films and endeavors,1

i think this is a pretty good movie but one thing makes it very interesting to me it is blatantly obvious once you look out for it the main characters in this movie are the inspiration for the bullies on the simpsons layne is jimbo john is kearney and tony is dolph there is even an episode of the simpsons where jimbo uses the line i poked her with a stickbr br the jimbolayne connection is the most obvious with the knit hat and long hair and the voice kearney has the shaved head unlike john but is the big dumb one the tonydolph connection is pretty obvious with the long parted haircut and even the secondtier status,1
this is the worst film i have ever seen so bad it is astonishing i am glad that i have never seen that black sidekick in any other film ok it wasnt his fault that someone gave him those lines but he could have refused the role and tried to learn how to act instead how did anyone get the money to put this film together is there some corporation in hollywood that deals with trash for male college students with no brain oh yeah they will love this one its got no believable plot some kungfu movements chuck norris a black sidekick with bad corny lines a sweet little israeli or is he an arab or does anyone care boy pickpocket and the devil brilliant and many thanks to all concerned for enriching the human race,0

this is a great film if this is any indication than hong sangsoo really is asian cinemas best kept secret its very similar in style to tsai mingliang and hou hsiaohsien and covers a lot of the same ground as them thematically but i think i actually enjoy this more as a whole than any single one of their films the overt minimalism is slightly less pronounced here than in their work although it still completely fits that style the camera never moves even once and somehow i found the film less selfconsciously slow than tsai mingliang or hou hsiaohsien which i think is part of the reason i enjoyed it more plus it doesnt keep its subjects quite as detached as hou does i felt like the film was also somehow more complete and less openended just barely than some of their work although thats not to say it had much of anything resembling a forwardmoving plot i would have a hard time believing that sophia coppola wasnt directly influenced by this film for lost in translation scenes of a young woman wandering around by herself and languishing in her hotel room wearing punk panties cant help but seem familiar,1
at the start this one is from england so of course i had 98 chances that it will be intelligent and very good cinema i never heard of this film before from the minute i saw helena bonhamcarter i said to myself oh heres comes the feminine version of my left foot i was right but i was also wrong wrong because the two movies are very differents my left foot was a john ford alike movie and this one is a chaplin alike movie not because this is funny but chaplin at that great sense of melodrama that brings tears to your eyes i was right because in 1990 handsome daniel daylewis turn a little bit ugly by playing an crippled person and he did it with a great sense of reality here very beautiful bonhamcarter did exactly the same thing but with very feminine emotions the story is well written and its very intelligent for me miss bonhamcarter gives one of the greatest womans part of the 1990s with emily lloyd in breaking the waves gee and look at her eyes she had the most beautiful eyes of cinema since jobyna ralston louise brooks michele morgan and ava gardner shes also a true talent as seen on many other movies see this one you wont regret it and a very fine job by branagh too,1
unwatchable you cant even make it past the first three minutes and this is coming from a huge adam sandler fan1,0
i have seen the trailer for this movie several times over and i have to say that ned kelly looks like it is going to be a wonderful film when i saw the trailer for the first time i could not take my eyes away from it it got my attention for sure heath ledger sticks to what he knows and what works for him period pieces not to mention orlando bloom who is seen for a split second looks fantastic i think that this movie will be a hit and will be seen over and over again my many people,1
first let me say that i am not a dukes fan but after this movie the series looked like law and order the worst thing was the casting of roscoe and boss hogg burt reynolds is not boss hogg and even worse was mc gainey as roscoe if they ever watched the show roscoe was not a hard ass cop he was more a barney fife than the role he played in this moviebr br the movie is loaded with the usual errors cars getting torn up and continues like nothing happened the worst example of this is when the the general gets together with billy prickett and the general is ran into a dirt hill obviously slowing to a near stop but goes on to win the race,0
ok first of all i am a huge zombie movie fan i loved all of romeros flicks and thoroughly enjoyed the remake of dawn of the dead so when i had heard every single critic railing this movie i was still optimistic i mean critics hated resident evil and while it may not be a particularly great film i enjoyed it if not for the fact that it was just a fun zombie shootem up with a half decent plot this however is pure crap terrible dialogue halfassed plot and video game scenes inserted into the film who in their right mind thought that was a good idea the only thing about this movie i use the term loosely that i enjoyed was jurgen prochnow as captain kirk ugh while his name throws originality out the window you can see in his performance that he knows hes in a god awful film and he might as well make the best of it everyone else acts as if theyre doing shakespeare and very badly i might add basically the only reason anyone should see this monstrosity is if you a are a huge zombie buff and must see every zombie flick made or b like to play mst3k the home game see it with friends and be prepared for tons of unintentional laughsbr br,0
as perhaps one of the few canadians who did not read the book in high school i thought i would add my comments seeing the movie without knowing the story beforehand in no way detracted from the film the characters have so many complexities everyone can relate to them in their own way the brilliance of the adaptation is that everyone is allowed to project their own perceptions onto the lives of the characters rather than being spoonfed an opinion you can love them or dislike them and still feel the emotional impact of the movie wonderful performances by ellen burstyn and christine horne really bring the characters to life id highly recommend it,1
honestly i dont really understand why there has been so much controversy about this show it embraces the elements of the original while expanding on them the storytelling has been updated and while some of the episodes seem to be a bit fast that is a good thingbr br christopher eccleston is perfect in the role easily as good as tom bakerbr br rose is one of the best companions on par with sarah jane smith or leelabr br i like the concept that the timelords have been destroyed no more politicking with the doctor acting as president emeritus and it adds something to the character to be the only one leftbr br the sfx are outstanding especially in comparison to the originalbr br take it from me and i was a huge dr who geek i actually took notes while watching the show all the way from dr number 1 to dr number 8 i tossed the horrible movie out of cannon personally this is the best sci fi show on tv right now possibly ever watch it and buy the dvd,1
ned akelly is such an important story to australians but this movie is awful its an australian story yet it seems like it was set in america also ned was an australian yet he has an irish accentit is the worst film i have seen in a long time,0
well the artyfartyrati of cannes may have liked this film but not me i am afraid if you like the type of film where shots linger for so long that you wonder whether the actor has fallen asleep or the cameraman gone for lunch then it may be for you a large part of it is like this with short sojourns into the realm of unpleasantness i did not find it shocking nor disturbing as some other reviewers have simply a little distasteful and pointless the only reason i did not give this one star is that the acting is commendable ans the film is fairly well shot the plot however has little to recommend a large part of the film just shows a grumpy woman teaching or listening to piano which might appeal to some people but lest you think this is harmless enough be prepared for some snatches of pornography and sexual violence just to wake you up with a bad taste in your mouth not recommended,0
donald pleasance and peter cushing united in one horror film that always sounds like a terrific plan two of the most versatile cult actors of their generation who previously already starred together in terrific genre outings like the flesh and the fiends and from beyond the grave pairing up in a mid70s satanic themed exploitation flick how can this possibly go wrong well unfortunately it can to my deepest regret land of the minotaur can hardly even be called mediocre and that in spite of the cast the exotic setting the appealing title and the potentially great sounding premise in a remote little area in greece more particularly near an archaeological site multiple tourists vanish because baron peter cushing and his docile followers keep feeding them to a firebreathing minotaur statue cushing who never looked more bored and uninterested in any role he played before owns a giant medieval castle and apparently in greek this means you also own the complementary archaeological ruins and an underground network of caverns that is of course quite handy if your hobby is the kidnapping of random campers and amateur archaeologists when three of his young friends also mysteriously disappear in the same area father roch the priest of a couple of towns before decides to investigate land of the minotaur is a boring and extremely slowpaced horror effort that never really undertakes any major attempts to generate a satanic atmosphere and doesnt bother to elaborate on all the potentially fascinating elements and pagan trivia details the titular minotaur for example is an intriguing creature of greek mythology with the head of a bull and the body of a person but for some inexplicable reason the script never deepens out the significance instead the film focuses on tedious and overly talkative sequences and loud inappropriate music altered with experimental noises the only reason to even consider giving this major disappointment of a film a chance is because of donald pleasance his portrayal of rude bossy and oldfashioned priest who criticizes everything that represents modern youth is powerful and reliable as always,0
jimmy stewart was a real life pilot wwii flier and a onestar general in the air force and therefore a natural for how real pilots react when they fly when you see the faithful recreation of the actual plane you begin to understand the reallife bravery and courage of lucky lindy when he flew the atlantic solo in 1927,1
the nest is really just another nature run amock horror flick that fails because of the low budget the acting is ok and the setting is great but somehow the whole film just seemed a bit dull to me the gore effects are not the best ive seen but are fun in a cheesy sort of way the roaches themselves are just regular cockroaches that bite people the nest reminded me of a much better film called slugs if you liked the nest then slugs is a mustsee as its ten times better also worth noting is that lisa langlois who plays elizabeth was in another nature run amock type film called deadly eyes aka the rats which is about killer rats as you may have guessed br br if you enjoy these types of horror films then you may want to give this a watch but youd be far better off seeing slugs which is far more interesting and gory,0

first of all i do not look down on americans i know lots of people that are intelligent people from the usa but this movie is so utterly bad that i just had to comment on itbr br first of allmovies are mostly far from the truth this movie is no exception lots of scenes are so incredibly false for example the departure of the 2 space ships you see them drop off the full tanks in space just a small distance from each other remember what caused the space shuttle to explode in the past just a tinsy winsy part that came off in here it is just common to drop fuel tanks that are as big if not bigger then the whole ship what idiot would let 2 spaceships lift up and do that at the same time second of it is that the russian station is a piece of scrap i hate to bring this up to you but astronauts nowadays go to russia since their equipment is much more reliable then nasas the space shuttle is retired and nasa uses it just to pay off the bills and there is no better alternative for it and the list of whoppers goes on and on this is truly an insult to people that do take space travel serious and i know half as much as these guys do but the most annoying part read the whole movie is the propaganda and patriot crap that u get choked with my god i thought i was looking at a cnn business commercial for like an hour the actors solve their petty problems by shooting at each other giving the middle finger to everyone they come face to face with start up fights ignore the police etc etc but when it comes to their love for their country and sacrificing their lives suddenly everyone stands in line to commit suicide for it bomb detonator maybe i lack the feeling of being a true patriot that can sing the national anthem backwards in swahili whilst riding with george bush behind the steering wheel of a golf cart driving in circles until the battery is empty but this movie was too much for me too handle and when i finally got hold and pulled the flag pole and fabric of the american flag out of my hiney i realised that i was glad this movie was finally done i do not know why so much good actors participated in this narrow minded stereotyping propaganda movie but i pity them this represents a country where you can get away with murder if you have money or power as long as uncle sam thinks you are a good patriot where everyone is happy as long as it is another country that has been devastated no one cares,0

where do i start do i say how great the cinematography is do i praise certain scenes which show the directors creativity do i tell how realistic the scenes on ellis island are should i mention that for a change we do not have the cliché scene of viewing statue of liberty by now immigrants viewing the statue from the ships railing is a clichébr br now whats not likable two major things one being a modern song score not even a good one to bootbr br second nearly deadly the film is boring it moves so slow that watching paint dry would be an improvementbr br the 118 minute running time is to long yet the film seems unfinished we see no scenes of this family in the us our hero mentions he wants to find his twin brother i would have enjoyed scenes of his futile of maybe lucky search instead of other drawn out scenesbr br the film is a near missbr br ratings out of 4 81 points out of 100 imdb 7 out of 10,1
one imdb reviewer calls eaten alive a passable film for the cannibal connoisseur are there such people i didnt know but if you are one of them hey have a ball the rest of you might find this tripe a bit hard to swallow pun intended even if like me you consider yourself a horror film connoisseur i have been an avid horror fan for about 15 years now although i never got around to the cannibal subgenre until a few weeks ago and i guess i owe my shortlived interest in these groaninducing movies strangely enough to chinas total disregard for copyright laws you see i bought a twodisc dvd collection of all of wesley snipes films for 20 yuan about 275 which turned out to include last cannibal world mountain of the cannibal god eaten alive cannibal holocaust next with nicholas cage and something called voodoo lagoon along with blade 13 in chinese nicebr br being a second sequel i immediately got a sinking feeling when the movie opened with a cannibal in street clothes wandering around major american cities shooting unsuspecting americans with poison darts and then scrambling away at full speed having run out of ways to keep movie cannibals scary it seems that now they have made their way to the mainland later you may be shocked to learn that this guy is on a training exercise lock up your daughters br br before long the movie settles into the old missing sister routine as a young blonde woman named sheila begins her own investigation of the disappearance of her sister who looks nothing like her in any way but shes willing to spend most of the movie naked so i guess that doesnt matter it seems that after shooting one of his victims the hapless cannibal we met early in the movie not used to big city life ran into the road and was struck dead by a moving van br br the brilliant police force find a mysterious bit of film on him showing sheilas sister involved in some bizarre ritual behavior but other than the film the guy is a complete mystery as the piteous police chief laments we know nothing about him except that hes dead poor guy he must be getting a headache from all this i recommend a nap luckily sheila is the kind of girl who can throw around tens of thousands of dollars like its nothing in the search for her sister perfect for hiring a plucky backwoods guide caricature since the police are clearly going to be no helpbr br obviously nothing new is added to this miniscule subgenre quite the contrary cannibalism almost seems like a background to a completely different kind of bad movie about the rescue of a missing person from the dangerous elements thickening the plot of that clothesline is not difficult all you have to do is add in a cartoonish jungle cult of people who follow some guy who calls himself jonas who believes in using pain as a way to reunite,0

after being off the air for a while columbo returned with some new madefortv mysteries that while not being as good as the original series are better than the shows that were done in the later 90sbr br murder can be hazardous to your health used the then and i guess now if you think about it true crime shows as the situation for a murder the murder is committed by a very successful egomaniacal true crime show host george hamilton in a nice bit of casting his chainsmoking nemesis who lost the job to him played by peter haskell attempts to blackmail hamilton when he discovers a porno video hamilton made with an underage actress in his salad days hamilton uses haskells cigarettes to deliver the death blow via poison giving himself an alibi as wellbr br columbo is brought in to find out what happened you know the rest highly entertaining,1
this crime thriller is sort of like a film noir though changes the context from postwar to cold war and has something relatively decent to say about humanity in pickup on south street policemen are good guys criminals are genuine guys and the only enemies are the commies who are ultimately differentiated from the goodguys in that they are emotionally personable driven by an actual care for their own worth as shown in the constant trackedin closeups that speckle the moviebr br this movie revolves around characters the personalities in this film are rather unique and detailed skip the pickpocket who is able to stare down any danger and sometimes while going through their personal possessions moe the informer who is just trying to save up for a spectacular funeral but who manages to capture the hearts and respect of nearly all the other characters and the audience candy the illnamed innocent girl who only thinks shes doing government work and doesnt fully comprehend the conspiracy shes involved with and joey the exboyfriend evil commie baddie who is trying to hide everything from everybody and ironically is the worst person at doing it throw in a bunch of very colorful supporting characters such as the guy with the chopsticks and the policemen and pickup on south street treats you to a splendor of personalities as they hunt down the mysterious and accidentally stolen microfilm framesbr br polarisdib,1

when originally screened in america in 1972 the night stalker became the highest rated madefortv movie in history based on jeff rices unpublished novel it told how a fearless investigative reporter named carl kolchak the late darren mcgavin discovered the existence of a vampire in modernday las vegas when it arrived on british television four years later it did not quite have the same impact but my friends were talking about it at school on monday morning as indeed was i we all agreed that it was one of the most exciting things we had seen br br i did not know of the existence of the night strangler until it turned up nearly a decade later itv who screened the kolchak movies had apparently decided to pass on the spinoff series they felt barnaby jones starring buddy ebsen to be more of a draw and anyway viewers might confuse kolchak with kojak for years my only source of information concerning the show was an article in fangoria magazine i could not even purchase the jeff rice novelsbr br then something wonderful happened in 1990 bbc2 put out the show as part of a latenight friday series devoted to the supernatural called mystery train hosted by richard obrian kolchak found himself rubbing shoulders with the likes of the brain eaters and earth vsthe spider the opening titles were trimmed removing kolchaks whistling and the closing creditswell there were nonebr br the first episode screened was werewolf i cannot say i was overly impressed but stuck with it and am i glad that i didbr br i really wish id seen it in 1974 my twelve year old self would have adored it creepy humorous exciting no wonder it fired chris carters imagination br br the shows biggest asset was of course mcgavin unlike the recent kolchak the original was an everyman figure eccentrically dressed rather conservative he was to the supernatural what columbo was to crime the late simon oakland was great too as kolchaks badtempered boss tony vincenzo the scripts overflowed with wonderful dry wit i found myself enjoying the programme more for the humour content than the horror when the twenty episodes ended i felt bereftbr br the xfiles came along a few years later and filled the void but only to an extent i wanted kolchak and vincenzo back i am glad that the show was never revived though without oakland it would not have been the samebr br i have the rice books now and have read them several times i was very surprised when stephen king slated the first in his book danse macabre as it is as good as anything he has written br br alright so some of the monsters were hardly stateoftheart but so what the new kolchak totally missed the point of the original what you dont see is sometimes more frightening than what you dobr br best episode horror in the heights worst episode the sentry,1
a group of friends break down in the middle of nowhere one had a flat tire the others jeep mysteriously wont start one of them takes the tire to a run down service station and that is the last anyone sees of him when the remaining foursome go in search of their friend they come across nice mr slaussen who offers to help fix the jeep and offers cool drinks and refuge from the heat in his equally run down hermitlike house which happens to be occupied by very realistic looking mannequins he goes with the one guy in the bunch out to work on the car and leaves the 3 girls in the house before he goes he warns them not to leave and go up to the house behind his shack he warns them about davy his brother who is lurking about and isnt all there of course one of them decides to venture out in search of a working phone and is never seen again is it slaussen is it davy the mannequins tourist trap has the usual horror requirements jiggly big boobed girl goody two shoes girl curiosity getting the better of people and never working out but it stands apart from the rest of the 70s genre in its twist of an ending i started to feel sorry for slaussen chuck conners is a terrific creepy overthetop performanceat a point in the film and you almost see the character of molly doing the same this is a gem if you can find it i had taped it off of cable when i was younger and walking through a used video store i spotted a vhs copy that was totally overpriced but well worth it fans of tanya roberts wont be disappointed either best part of the film for me was the scene with the soup and crackersbr br i gave it a 7 because some of the movie was and still is hard to explain,1
this proves just how awful the wb network was in the last few years of its existence as a homeschooler i of course deplore this show for its ridiculous fantasy land obscure unfunny stereotypes about the kids being weird hippies who are so smart theyre alienated from the supercool high school students sorry tv writers the world as viewed from inside your ass containing your heads apparently when you wrote this showis not the world we talented people see with our eyes as we live in a little thing called reality as for those who actually liked this showplease dear sweet jesus please rethink the statement that you actually liked this crap over a very long walk the acting is even more hollow phony and wooden than the stereotypes the whole show was built around thank you wb for doing the right thing and putting this horse out of its beginningtoend misery this show never ever shouldve even had the privilege of being made no less having so much as eight awful episodes i really hope that these actors eventually got a clue and stopped playing roles in garbage tv shows like this as soon as this show ended,0
this movie was so heart warming a true testament to an actors real life everyday ups and downsit was truly a wonderful experience to share the passion of the actor on film and respect for what it must have taken off screen this film is a reminder to everyone to go for there dreamsnever give uphurray for the stand in,1
before seeing this i was merely expecting another mediocre soft core copy of the much imitated emmanuelle series starring sylvia kristel it was really surprising how good this one turned out to be it actually has a story and it is very romantic indeed what makes yellow emanuelle so good is its leading heroine the beautiful and exotic chai lee she plays her character emy wong so sweetly that the viewer just has to feel something for her when her dreams crash down around her emy wong is a muchrespected doctor statuesque with a regal quality she comes from an important old family where ancient customs are still practiced emy will remain a virgin until she is married to a man she has never met the beautiful doctor seems ok with this arranged marriage it is simply how it is done in her world however she does not plan on meeting and falling in love with the british pilot who ends up under her care in the hospital where she works emy decides to do away with custom and she gives herself to her western man but only after a very long courtship as doctor wong is anything but an easy woman her pilot george is a good guy and promises to marry emy so that she doesnt lose her respectability and place in her rigid society neither one counts on a third party one ilona staller who destroys their relationship through a series of vicious games emy is made to believe that she has been abandoned by her man that he only played a game with her in order to sleep with her her place in society is gone she has been debased the film takes a surprisingly dramatic and depressing turn as this proud elegant woman gives up her career as well as a sweet relationship with her caring father and succumbs to a life of drinking and prostitution i was surprised to find myself so engrossed in this operatically tragic tale i was on the edge of my seat when george blows back into town and unknowingly walks into a hotel where his beautiful emy is working as a prostitute classic drama i imagine many viewers were a bit frustrated by all this drama one would expect lots of sex and nudity here but there is not much and when there is it is totally nonexploitative and very artsy and softcore if you are a fan of the first emmanuelle with sylvia kristel than you most likely will appreciate this lesser known classic i was especially impressed by the extra attention to details the whole segment where emy takes george to her fathers house on the island is really nice her father shows george and the viewer his impressive collection of bonzai trees he has a whole miniature forest built out of these amazing trees totally unexpected after catching it on late night cable tv years ago i spent much time searching the internet for a copy of the film when i finally got it i found that the,1
this show is painful to watch br br it is obvious that the creators had no clue what to do with this show from the ever changing jobs boyfriends and cast it appears that they wanted to cast amanda bynes in something but had no idea what and came up with this crappy show they cast her as a teen surrounded by twenty and thirty somethings and put her in mostly adult situations at repeatedly failed attempts at comedy soon they realize that she needs a clique and cast people in their late 20s to try to pass as teenagersbr br how this show survived 4 seasons is beyond me somehow abc has now decided that it is a family show and thrown it into its afternoon lineup on abc family,0
nothing to spoil here at all but this could be a spoiler so bewarebr br special effects were on the level of a video game about five years ago or perhaps of the original star trek the acting was just pathetic some cheesy looking blonde treking across the desert while a voice in the background droned on and on and on this was the trek and drone half that i actually made it through progress is interrupted by a few fights ships blow each other up for no real reason that is apparent episodically again its not that there is a real fight that you would expect from a movie more like a cheap video game boiing boiing ship explodes next ship apparently some of the ships are looking for the blonde here in the far future ships must be nearsighted and astigmatic because many of them pass directly overhead of the stylishly dressed futuristic babe in black but never see her br br then there are a couple of choreographed fights that look like something put on by high school kids again the crude video game mentality is prominent the combatants shift to fight mode by flipping something on their wrists and a loud computerized voice echoes and flashes fight mode that must be a dandy design if you are trying to sneak up on somebody then you go to a big power station which looks just like a current day power line tower and plug in to charge back up lol im not kidding you cant make this stuff up its like watching a freaking video game from about 2000 only the acting is better in the gamebr br more trekking then she shows up at the city lame sound trek gets even lamer here she gets into a fight with a mech robot of the future who cannot hit her with his big gun even though she runs right in front of him about five feet in front of him obviously robots of the far future are about as useful as toaster ovens in a fight she throws sand in its eyes and beats it to death by throwing rocks at it rofl i was at about 95 of tolerance by that point my nausea circuits flashing redbr br in the next scene she ends up strapped to a rocket with some rope i kid you not tied right to the outside of a rocket this is supposed to be an advanced form of transportation at that point i bailed br br this movie is an utter disgrace for a movie made at the present time just a freaking disgrace there was a drippy story but the movie distracted from it somebody droning on about mother constantly br br i gave it a two because there were a few scenes which displayed some pretty nice artwork of a science fiction nature as background unfortunately the plot acting action cinematography and narrative distracted from this artwork and degraded it no kidding,0
i happened to love the show growing up along with millions of others so i tuned in to this movie thinking if not good it might be at least a bit dazzling and funbr br wrong i just have to wonder at the end of this was charlies angels really that boring i dont seem to remember it as such but this movie as bad as movies of this type can be bore little resemblance to the excitement of that time period and show i did see it all in spite of the negatives it wasnt unwatchable but it was very bland which i do not fault the performers for at all particularly the women who played the angels as they really did look like them the movie just wasnt that interesting it tried to make each angel a character one angel is to feisty one is the good girl one is to into her husbandall characters were portrayed with one major characteristic defining them and little depth beyond stereotypes the excitement of the show was missing and the dialog wasdialog thats pretty much itbr br not awful not the worst of tv movies but missable,0
this film was embarrassing in its clichés poor acting and generally low production values it starts out badly with the long haired 3 star general calling the hero masters major when he is obviously wearing the silver oak leaves of lieutenant colonel but what was most distressing was the crew of soldiers on neptune atoll how out of touch with any kind of reality can you get they were all experts on flying a 747 and the scenes of the soldiers digging the ditch were beyond comicalbr br warning this film is dangerous to your intellectual health watch at your own peril,0
this is a solid underrated little thriller that has thrillsa plenty with a cool story sandra bullock is terrific all the characters are great and i was surprised by how unpredictable it was as there were only a few predictable moments plus sandra bullock is simply amazing in this jeremy northam played an awesome villain and i know what bullocks character in this is all about because im kind of the same type of personi hardly ever go out plus this is pretty well made and written for the most part this should be higher then 55 in my opinion plus denis miller was surprisingly better then expected in his small role the scene where northam terrorizes bullock on his boat was quite suspenseful and was one of my favorite moments and i also liked the chase scene in the carnival plus i liked the ending too as it was quite well done even if i did think northam was defeated too quickly there are lots of other good chase scenes as well and its also clever at times too plus there are quite a few shocking moments as well this is a solid underrated little thriller that has thrills aplenty with a cool story sandra bullock is terrific i highly recommend this one the direction is great irwin winkler does a great job here with excellent camera work adding good atmosphere good angles and keeping the film at a very fast pace the acting is fantastic sandra bullock is amazing as always and is amazing here she is extremely likable tough as nails yet quite vulnerable and i was able to feel for her because as i said im sort of like angelai hardly ever go out i really enjoyed her work in this movie bullock rules jeremy northam is excellent as the villain he was sneaky unpredictable and very menacing he was great dennis miller is surprisingly ok and non annoying in his small role and managed to bring some comic relief rest of the cast are fine overall i highly recommend this one 12 out of 5,1
when i was growing up voyage into space was my most favorite movie i remember the time when ktla channel 5 ran the movie for the whole week and me and my sisters watched it every single day i still remember every part of that movie the ending was so sad when giant robot got blown up along with guillotine and then watching johnny sokko with all the tears running down his face calling for giant robot there should have been a sequel to the movie in which giant robot somehow survived the explosion i cant believe that there are so many other voyage into space fans still out there i really want to buy the movie when it comes out on dvd but my sister said that the ones out there now are bootlegged and probably bad quality copies of the movie i dont know why they havent released it yet since its been over 40 years now i think voyage into space was made back in 1968 only now my second favorite japanese monster movie of all time the war of the gargantuas is finally coming to dvd and being released on sept 9th and i cant wait now if only they would do the same with voyage into space giant robot johnny sokko and voyage into space will never be forgotten in my eyes and probably many others too it will always be a childhood classic to me,1
film critics of the world i apologize it is your job to give advice to the moviegoing public so that they can wisely choose what to spend money on but i ignored your advice and i have been deeply hurt however my decision to see the cat in the hat wasnt made haphazardly you see three years ago all of you critics said that we should all avoid the calamity known as how the grinch stole christmas then some friends of mine took me to see it and it turned out to be a colorful funny and almost hypnotic yuletide treat so when the critics unleashed their fury against the cat in the hat another big budget seuss update with a big name star in the title role i thought that it must be the same old song how wrong i wasbr br for five whole minutes i thought i was in the clear the opening credits are clever the kids are charming and the production values are top notch then the cat showed up there are many problems from this point on but the biggest one was the woeful miscasting of mike myers where the grinch was saved by the inspired casting of jim carrey the cat was destroyed by myers he can be very funny when his energies are applied where they belong comic sketches every movie hes made that was truly funny was really just a feature length comedy sketch from waynes world to austin powers so he tries to do the same thing here its just that these comedy sketches are more like the stuff that they stick at the end of snl not funny just painful not that the writers helped him out any after the charming prologue the movie turns into an hour of repulsive bodily humor gags poorly timed pratfalls and insultingly stunted attempts at hip humor this movie was the most disheartening cinematic experience i have ever had period so much talent and work went into something so vile i know that the adult stars of this movie will be relatively unscathed by this mess i just hope that the wonderful spencer breslin and dakota fanning will get more chances to show their charms in far better movies if you are a parent please avoid this like the plague with movies like elf and brother bear currently in theaters you have far better choices,0
i was about 11 years old i found out i live 048 miles from the uncle house the uncle house is on westway dr deer park tx they have added homes since the movie was made i dont know the house number but you can go look it up i am now 21 and i enjoy watching this movie the bar on spencer is no longer their pasadena isd wants to build a school their i drove by the house last week the house still looks great my dad and uncle would go to the street where the house is and watch the actors come in and out of the house trying to make the movie where john cross over the railroad cracks they have made 225 higher when i hear about john loesing his son i start thinking about when he made urban cowboy he was 26 or 25 at the time,1
peter sellers plays dick scratcher haha a cook for a pirate ship who takes over as captain after he murders the previous one although hes witnessed a treasure being buried he begins losing his memory and the treasure map he obtains becomes blank thus dick is forced to find someone who can see and communicate with ghosts do you place an ad for that and help lead a path to the treasure its mind boggling how anyone could have bankrolled this pointless film former goon spike milligan replaced medak as director and given medaks talents in the film the ruling class you can probably guess which of the grainy poorly lit scenes had milligan in the directors chair peter boyle makes a brief appearance in the films first 10 minutes as the doomed pirate captain hes probably quite thankful that young frankenstein was released the same year this was filmed and canned so that he can keep this off his resume franciosa looks dashing as the handsome powerbehindscratcher but he and seller both look pretty desperate with even sellers makeup and hair looking quite terrible they had to know this movie was bombing even as they were filming it with lines like these i can understand any possible uneasebr br pierre about to be hanged youll pay for thisbr br scratcher no i wont ill do it for freebr br and thats one of the good jokes its amazing to me that much of sellers prolific material is still in the vaults but this was made available on vhs more than 15 years ago how about someone stepping up to the plate and releasing in the us the wellreceived british tv program a show called fred starring sellers milligan and directed by the great richard lester,0
one of the best horrorsuspense movies i have seen in a long time wow it was a big surprise and stunning at how good this movie was sometimes a gem like this will surface but is rare i expected a popcorn monster flick and a mildly diverting way to spend a late night but instead a very well made and directed movie with great acting and made with passion and heart br br this is a movie that makes you feel for the characters and what happens to them and it is filmed like you are there and it is really happening i know some people in other reviews compare it to open water but i disagree because i thought open water was quite boring and mediocre while this movie was the opposite although superficially they are filmed in the same realistic stylebr br the actors are unknowns at least to me but they all are very effective and convey the dire situation with frightening intensity and realism the story is well done and flows smoothly the plot is logical and appears to be something that could happen all the actions and thoughts of the characters are quite what a person would do and think about very believable and this makes the movie more real because of itbr br i had tears in my eyes at the end i must say a movie seldom has this effect on me this is how powerful and emotional this movie was done and i am suitably impressed by the director and actors of this great movie,1
i found this to be a soso romancedrama that has a nice ending and a generally nice feel to it its not a hallmark hall of fametype family film with sleepingbeforemarriage considered normal behavior but considering it stars jane fonda and robert de niro i would have expected a lot rougher movie at least languagewise br br the most memorable part of the film is the portrayal of how difficult it must be to learn how to read and write when you are already an adult thats the big theme of the movie and it involves some touching scenes but to be honest the film isnt that memorablebr br its still a fairly mild nice tale that i would be happy to recommend,1
i dont expect a lot from ghost stories but i do expect a story to make a bit of sense is that asking too much from the screenwriters and filmmakers when the bad guy all of the sudden becomes a homicidal maniac solely because a bunch of crows start pecking him then i have a problem spending 900 for a ticket alfred hitchcock would be spinning in his grave didnt anyone learn anything in their college film 101 class a good movie has at its roots an interesting storybr br here are some of the ridiculous messages in this movie if you have desperate financial problems move from chicago to the middle of nowhere in north dakota to grow sunflowers i kid you not if your toddler has serious neurological problems from a car accident move away from some of the best hospitals and speech therapists in the country to an isolated small town which at best has a community hospital hire a drifter to live work with you out of the blue without checking any references when you have a teenage vixen daughter a wife and toddler im glad theyre not my parents br br a town where everyone knows everything would have no problem missing a triple homicide just outside of town and of course blame the mans lunacy on a bad crop of sunflowers doesnt anything else grow in north dakota a couple of days after you buy your rundown house with huge vines growing everywhere that it reminds you of jack and the beanstalk a guy from the xfiles ala smoking man im glad to see the cigarettes didnt get him i guess he doesnt inhale will just suddenly sneak up on you while youre working to offer you the sale price of your home plus 15 more for absolutely no reasonbr br i think you get the picture i have seen so many godforsaken awful movies in the past month it just blows my mind is it that difficult to make a movie that doesnt treat the audience like an idiot im glad at least the crows in this sorry film turned out to have the some brains i wish i could say the same for whomever thinks they are going to make money off this celluloid piece of trash,0
i enjoyed every moment of this beautiful film and was intrigued about this female painter i had never heard of before so i set out exploring her life and work afterwards as could be expected i found out that the film was not exactly historically accurate i was a little astounded however by the very negative comments on the film because of this inaccuracy come on guys a film isnt and shouldnt be a biography nor a novel any historical film distorts reality because it should be a work of art in its own right a film director is fully entitled to use elements from reality and history to create a world of his own artemisia is a wonderful film and i think it brought many people including some that now give negative comments to explore the life and work of this fascinating artist,1
this tv film tells the story of extrovert frannie suddenly returning to silk hope to visit friends and family but unaware of her mothers death her sister runs the family home but is intending to sell it and move away with her new husband frannie strongly objects to the idea and vows to keep the family heirloom as it were by getting a job and maintaining responsibilitybr br in comes handsome ruben and the two soon fall in love as you do and its from this point that i sort of lost interestbr br there is more to farrah fawcett than just the blonde hair and looks she can portray a character extremely convincingly when she puts her mind to it and it is certainly proved here as well as some of her previous efforts like extremities and small sacrificies a great performance from the legendary charlies angelbr br silk hope is the type of film that never shies away from its cheap and cheerful tv image and you know there was a limit to the budget but its not the worst film ever made the positive aspects are there you just have to find them,0
i was one chosen to see this movie in a sneak previewbr br first you should know that this film is based on the video game far cry a for its time really good game 2004 second you should know that the regisseur of this flick is the great uwe boll this is a man who takes video games dungeon siege bloodrayne postal etc and makes movies out of them very horrible onesbr br i still remember when i saw bolls the kings swords a dungeon siege tail there were so horrible mistakes in this film like 3 scenes playing at the same time 2 at daytime and one somehow at nightbr br so lets come to far cry if you expect cool action forget it really cheap tricks and a plastic helicopter are far away from real action if you expect a cool story forget it orientating by the notsobad story of the game this movie is a laugh the actors playing makes the movie in a lot of moments funny but in a nogood waybr br i had the chance to see this movie for free so do not do the mistake and pay for this trash its one of my favorised flicks for the bottom 100,0
yes the cameras were in the right place at the right time its so interesting to see how a world leader like chavez who supports the poor people in his country can be held in such low esteem in the us his worst sin in my opinion is caring about those who are at the bottom of the barrel what can be so bad about that i have always been fascinated by the us governmentmedia reaction to fidel castro at first castro was a good guy around 1959 when he supplanted batista soon however castro started turning the corporations in cuba toward the needs of the poor instead of the fat cats were a decent country but why does our media and government have such a problem with sharing with the poor if these guys are dictators then we could use more dictatorships especially where the poorest of the poor live in the world,1
it seems whenever a mainstream film company wants to make a movies for teens it concentrates on only one thing sex dont get me wrong im no prude but the fact that these people seem to think getting my rocks off is all im interested in is highly offensive take the convenant a film that relies so heavily on you finding the main characters attractive it thinks it can get away without a plot andor a script that wasnt written by a six year old this is essentially the craft with supposedly hot guys and yeah thats it it bored me to tears even my friend who usually laps us crap films hated it it is really stunningly bad to the extent where it can actually be funny i would have laughed if it wasnt for the fact that several other females in cinema attendance seemed to be enjoying it they were accompanied by several shifty looking guys who positively curled up and died when the really cliché boy on boy kiss happened towards the end watching them squirm really was the highlight of the film i dont think mainstream hollywood cinema will ever put out good films for teenagers or indeed for anyone so i think ill give up unless youre a teen who likes the pussycat dolls thinks paris hilton is hot and watches mtv its like some sort of wasteland lifes hard when youre a fifteen year old who likes art house ps someone should have told the director that not all teenage girls find would be boy band members totally hawt lol111,0
this movie is 1 in the list of worst movies i have ever seen with lessons for an assassin on the 2 spotbr br the acting is lousy sorry sandra bullock but even your performance was horrible the music score could have come from a bad xrated movie and the story was downright ridiculous it had this in common with a typical action movie the dialogues were short and consisted mainly of onesyllable words but contrary to the average action movie there was no real action in this one boringbr br the only reason i continued watching it was in the hopes that at one point there would be at least one interesting scene in this movie br br thumbs down on this one,0
out of the 600 or so spaghetti westerns made this has got to be in the top twenty somewhere can not believe this hasnt received any reviews gemma is excellent in this van johnson is good too though his dubbed voice is a little off killter but thats the charm of the italian style beautiful photography and some excellently staged action all the supporting characters are well played the severity of the racist streak in the bad guys is pretty tough even by todays standards which creates an emotional depth to gemmas character in some of the situations that take place absolutely fantastic score by luis bacalov see this is in the wonderful wide screen dvd from japan a spaghetti must have,1
i watched this over the christmas period i dont know why but it reminds me of christmas so i watched it so there we are br br arthur is a film i watch all the way through with a big dumb smile on my face and its a mixture of special performances great jolly music and a script crackling with wit and charm that causes it br br dudley moore makes a character that could well be hated very easily spoiled rich lazy drunk who feels sorry for himself but turns him into someone you love liza minelli is great as linda morolla a queens waitress who manages to pull off the toughsoft on the inside lady arthur nearly gives up his world for john gielgud gets all the juicy lines and polishes them off with relish br br i can watch arthur again and again and it always makes me feel good check it out if you need a lift its a lovely film,1

i felt it necessary to respond to the comments posted on the front page of this films page because some of it was slightly misinformativebr br originally i posted quotes from the original poster but i wasnt sure if it was proper given that this is the comments index and not a message board though we used to use em that way back before imdb added the film message boards so i will edit this to make it unnecessarybr br well first of all you may not be aware of this but gene kelly first became famous for playing pal joey on broadway in the original production when vincente minnelli decided to make a gershwin panorama film he wanted kellys character to be more sophisticated than the goody two shoes roles he had been playing in most his films with the exception of for me and my gal alan jay lerner was instructed to construct a new story set in paris based on the story of pal joey this gave kelly a chance to play his famous role from broadway even though warners had outbid mgm for the rights to pal joey in my opinion the wb film pal joey is a wreck though sinatra was suitable for the role but other problems sunk the film script changes and poor direction br br you complain that kellys pictures are not well done even citing your art education to prove the point but you miss the fact that kellys bad art was clearly designed to be bad and it is necessary for the storycharacters the pictures are so bad the audience knows that kelly isnt ready for an exhibition even he knows it though milo has sort of sugared him up to the point where he almost believes her but its important that the audience not be sitting there saying but hes a great artist if he only had the chance you want the audience to be fully aware of his deficienciesbr br then you complain that he sabotages his interest in the show again you are not understanding the structure of the story he refuses because he doesnt want to feel like a gigolo and because he knows hes not really ready for the exhibition his enthusiasm for the exhibition is certainly not as great as joeys enthusiasm to start a nightclub but it serves the same function in the plot remember its essential in pal joey the play that joey gives up his nightclub after he realizes that he doesnt deserve it same with the art show if kellys paintings were actually good it would undermine this whole point br br then you complain that caron and kelly have no chemistry i guess its in the eye of the beholder i agree the chemistry between them is not as strong as it should be but for me it was fine compare it to even worse forced romances like the one between cary grant and sophia loren in the pride and the passion br br when you say that the big dance,1
fever pitch isnt a bad film its a terrible filmbr br is it possible american movie audiences and critics are so numbed and lobotomized by the excrement that hollywood churns out that theyll praise to the skies even a mediocre film with barely any laughs thats the only reason i can think of why this horrible romantic comedy and i use that term loosely because theres nothing funny in this film is getting good reviewsbr br i sat through this film stunned that screenwriters lowell ganz and babaloo mandel would even for an instant think their script was funnybr br the brilliant nick hornby usually translates well to film he adapted fever pitch for a british film starring colin firth and ruth gemmell in 1997 peter hedges found hornbys voice for about a boy 2002 and when high fidelity was americanized for a movie in 2000 writers dv devincentis steve pink john cusack and scott rosenberg didnt go wrong because they kept the essence of hornbys wit and humor they made one of the best films of that yearbr br so why does the american version of fever pitch go so painfully awry the british version wasnt a masterpiece but it was charming funny unexpected and gave us two characters we could like respect and understandbr br but ganz and mandel have excised everything funny in hornbys work in americanizing the story theyve butchered it removing all that was good and unique about hornbys work and replacing it with conventional drivelbr br theyve transformed a funny story into a formulaic romantic comedy never once veering from the wretched formula lindsey drew barrymore has three girlfriends each of whom has a distinct function ones overweight the seconds cynical and ambitious and the thirds a romantic want to guess how many male friends ben jimmy fallon hasbr br what made high fidelity such fun was not only a good leading man and lady but engaging supporting characters in this fever pitch the six supporting friends do or say nothing especially funny theyre so insignificant theyre not even decorative the only reason theyre in the film is because the formula demands it poor ione skye winds up as one lindseys pals in a thankless role the lovely skye must have been wishing lloyd dobler would swoop in and take her away come to think of it cusack wouldve made an excellent ben of course cusack is too smart to attach himself to such an utterly tedious scriptbr br there isnt a single solitary moment in this film that seems original or unforced every plot turn is predictable every lame joke telegraphed ganz and mandel labor for laughs the first 45 minutes are so excruciatingly slow you wonder if these chaps realized they were writing a comedy you can mark the plot turns in this film by your watch its almost as if ganz and mandel penned this with some screen writing gurus formula pasted on the wall when they got to a certain page they looked up at the formula and said ok the guru,0
slow but beautifullymounted story of the american revolution griffiths storytelling seems a lot less heavyhanded than in his earlier historical epics and his tableaux work is fully integrated into the action lionel barrymore is an utter swine neil hamilton is poor but dashing and carol dempster is well carol dempster is most of what is wrong with griffith in this period but she doesnt show up often enough to slow the pace and dramabr br note that the trivia for this movie says it came in originally at slightly more than 2 hours when first released but that no cut exists that runs longer than 90 minutes however the dvd release has been presented at a slower fps rate that increases the tension and brings it back to a bit over two hoursbr br far better in terms of storytelling than sound versions such as the patriot while not quite in the league of griffiths best such as way down east and broken blossoms an excellent way to spend a couple of hours,1
even sophie marceaus presence and the few very few good french gags are unable to save this otherwise slow and boring movie a disappointment the story is weak and so is acting this movie was advertised as the french version of the mummy but the mummy has at least spectacular and enjoyable effects,0
br br robot jox is a great little film ok some of the sets are bad and the acting is not that great but the special effects are very good for a film of this size and age you have to remember that this film is over 10 years old now and was made very cheaply in the 1st place so you cant moan to much about the bad parts so just sit back and watch a cool film with great big robots in it,1
i really enjoyed doctor mordrid this is a lowbudget film which may be offputting to some but i have no problem with it i admire it even more for that considering its way more entertaining than the drivel that hollywood churns out every year too bad this didnt get a theatrical release i dont know about anyone else but i would have went to see it in theatres doctor mordrid is a very entertaining science fiction film that just about anyone can enjoy especially if theyre into scifi like i am i dont see why this is a rrated film only one fword is said and there are no gruesome death scenes nor is there any blood at all the timeless rivalry between sorcerers anton and kabal anton wanted the use his powers to save the human race while kabal wanted to enslave them gave the story a sense of enchantment while the mythical plotline added charm to the story itself basically this a film thats just plain fun to watch there is one unintentionally funny thing in this movie though seeing jeffrey combs keeping a straight face while wearing that silly blue cape and suit that makes me laugh every time i see it but i digress anyway the acting is great the main protagonists anton and his lady friend samantha are very likable anton is sympathetic and hospitable and samantha is friendly plus the settings were wonderful the floating island in the other dimension was very cool setting were only given a glimpse of it twice though it would have been great to see more scenes take place here the main setting was also very neat antons apartment is very roomy and he has some cool devices especially the monitoring system he uses to keep track of the worlds occurrences he even has a pet raven that he keeps in his apartment named edgar overall this a great film it was fun to watch and the main actors put a lot of feeling into their roles if you can find anywhere that rents doctor mordrid you should rent it or in my case buy it it was definitely money wellspentbr br my rating 8 stars out of tenbr br,1

i just viewed this great goodnatured parody of night of the living dead and i have to say it was so awful and so corny it was excellent this movie incorporated all the antics and scenery shots that the original had including the cemetery the supposable abandoned house the basement and the front lawn what i especially love about this movie is the comical use of bread and all the common household enemies bread has a grudge against cmon we know that toasters toaster ovens and ziplocks have done bread in a dozen times and now we must call for their help in order to defeat the reanimated bread aside from the cheap acting and voiceovers this short horror film is my personal favorite parody of night of the living dead even better than night of the living dead of 1990br br i think what makes this movie worth watching is how the writers and directors utilized all the dialogue from the original movie and revolved it around bread including how the bread became reanimated and to avoid leftovers because they are especially dangerous another great reason why i love this movie is that there is no exception as to what bread is evil bagels are evil and even communions are evil which is demonstrated by a hilarious scene involving a newscaster and a rather monotone priest i think that the actors are especially humorous performing the deed of being viscously attacked by slices of bread ie the car scene i think the end is very worth sticking aroundbr br even though this is a short and that night of the day of the dawn of the son of the bride of the return of the revenge of the terror of the attack of the evil mutant alien flesh eating hellbound zombified living dead part 2 in shocking 2d is debatably another great parody its still recommend as a great horror parody done by what seems to be college filmmakers i highly recommend this movie to anybody who is able to make fun of night of the living dead and still have respect for the filmmakers i would also like to recommend this movie to anybody who loves dmovies and horror parodys its just a wonderful little short horror film thats fun to watch and learn,1
for those that might send me nasty emails shove it there is a trend in hollywood where those that create overlyquirky movies are instantly impervious to criticism garden state tends to be one of those movies br br sure zach braff star of a rather overrated sitcom surprises people with some talent behind the camera but that doesnt warrant the kind of praise that a film like this has been receiving the story is often times too thin and shallow to provide any real insight people have compared this film to the graduate but those type of people are the types that try to oversell independent cinema indie films are subject to the same hit and miss mentality that typically hits the studio films but people seemed to have forgotten that there are far more bad indie films than good ones garden state isnt atrocious but its isnt greatbr br first off the film is too quick resulting in a rather fast reemergence of large into his former life after ten years people tend to act like he never left wheres the awkwardness of course the situation is always solved by a quick drug tasting scene which i will say was portrayed rather accurately the film seem to present a lot of emotional inequities giving us the idea that the emotion will come up later in a more deeper and more well thought out way however it fails to deliver on those fronts leaving us wondering why the journey to some of his decisions and moments were quickly resolved like peter saarsgards grave robbing tendencies it wasnt completely abysmal but maybe we should stop praising the film as something it isnt,0
when i first saw this movie in the theater i was so angry it completely blew in my opinion i didnt see it for a decade then decided what the hell lets see im watching all hellraiser movies now to see where it went wrong my guess is it was with sequel 5 that was the first to implement the whole i am in a dream omg i see weird stuff oh noes what is happening oh its a dream oh its not a dream oh wait i see something spooky oh never mindsucky storyline those sequels dont even require the box to be opened or stick to the rules from the first 4 movies that if you saw pinhead you are pretty much screwed and dead the first 3 hellraisers sticked to this storyline which made it so scary in the first place nothing fantasy nothing weird the box got opened boom they came kirstey was the only one that could bargain her way out of it first because of uncle frank then because she had information about the cenobites this movie at least attempts to stick to all that even though it was a bad story it was still somewhat hellraiser no im pretty sure part 5 was the first part to completely and utterly destroy the hellraiser series now they are remaking 1 and i dont even think i will watch it oh who am i kidding i probably will and probably will be disappointed again,0
first let me review the movie this movie creeps me out and i dont even believe in aliens however the movie has its flawsbr br there are three acts to this movie act one is perfect it sets up the movie and really builds up the creep factor i must say the score is great everything is set up and its set up perfectlybr br act two begins when jillian playing sherry burton goes to the shrink they hypnotize her and she recalls the abduction act two ruins the film when the aliens show up screaming mad george did the effects for the aliens i must say they did a good job except with their depiction of the gray aliens no offense but the grays looked like inflatable door prizesbr br on a side note i liked how they treated hypnosis in acts one and two if you paid attention you would notice that the husband and wife had two different memories in the husbands version of events the blue light zaps them and his wife says somebodys here or something like it it makes sense the husband is concerned for his wife someone may hurt her thats his issue however in her version of events she says help me she does not say somebodys here this also makes sense the aliens are after her wanting her husband to help and save her is her issue now back to the filmbr br act three turns the film into a gore fest it begins with a strange ultrasound procedure its a typical gore fest but it does have a surprise ending i wont ruin it because its actually an interesting development br br the dvd and commentaries takes itself too seriously but if you think wilford brimley saying horsesh is funny you might want to check it out in the cast interviews section now on to my praise of jillian mcwhirterbr br i could only hope jillian will read this i had never seen her before but wow what a performance let me tell the rest of you this first of all this is supposed to be a serious film the details i will now describe may sound campy and fun like humanoids from the deep 1980 but it really isnt got that okaybr br jillian is hot naturally goodlooking she is naked for a lot of the film a good thing unfortunately she is usually being assaulted terrorized and raped a very bad thing however she must act in a lot of this film naked she gets points for overcoming that she has to act happy sad horny afraid and physically hurt all in the span of a few moments the turnaround of emotion is astounding she has to cheer for joy when she learns shes pregnant she has to scream in terror when the aliens take out her guts she has to act very angry when her husband suggests that the baby isnt his she has to act like shes in denial saying nothing is wrong with her baby when her,1
though for a film that seems to be trying to market itself as a horror there was a distinct lack of bloodbr br there was also a distinct lack of skilled directing acting editing and scriptwritingbr br jeremy london put in one of most appalling performances ive ever seen his descent into the maelström of madness is achingly selfaware and clumsy oh look at him twitch oh look at him drink strong spirits oh look at him raise his brow and cock his head at a jaunty angle oh look at his unwashed greasy dark hair oh listen to his affectedly husky voice he must be a tortured artistwritergenius oh yes out comes the poetshirt its another boy who thinks hes byron or poe oh for the love of did someone give this guy a manual on how to act good or did they just pull him out of a cardboard box somewhere the defunct little plastic toyprize in a discontinued brand of bargainbin cereal okay that was a stupid line but thats only because londons performance has melted my brain with its awfulnessbr br katherine heigl is cute and very briar rose but has yet to grow into her acting shoes in this film she delivered her lines like she was being held up in fact her whole performance was very wooden her poses as stiff as her lines who knows perhaps she was just reacting to and trying to neutralise jeremy londons flailing excesses but if thats the case she takes it too farbr br notable is arie verveen as poe while his characters role is confused he delivers the best performance of the piece he quite simply looks right but its more than that he has some sort of depth i believed that he had a life beyond the dismal twodimensional quality of the rest of the characters huh maybe its just because i like poe and could thus just let my mind wander and invent while he was on screen whatever he had an interest factor otherwise missingbr br the rest of the characters are a faceless blur there are all the usual caricatures the perky blonde bestfriend whos a bit of a floozy the smitten local cop whos a bit of a dork the protective older man who perhaps has too much unfatherly interest in our heroine the scheming old witch etc etc yawn yawn br br as with the distinct lack of blood for a horror movie issue none of the themes that they mention and that londons character mentions so scathingly in his attack on poes writing are followed through on as another reviewer said there was potential here murder incest genuinely shocking stuff but instead they skirt away from the issues and cut away from the violence a raised candlestick swinging through the air closing in on its victim thencut to black this is fine in a noirish traditional horror indeed its expected and is fondly received when it happens its a dear convention especially when accompanied by fake lightning bolts and intense siouxie,0
this show has come so far at first everyone in the cast from eric to fez they were all new actors and actresses fresh faces and just look what they accomplished they stuck with the show and it was a success its one of the best shows ever made and its probably the funniest sitcom ive ever seen in my life it will be sad to see it end but if they end this show i hope to god that the series finale goes out with one of the biggest bangs that any season finale has ever had i dont care if the whole season sucks because they save all the fuel for the final episode go down swinging get one last punch in the show deserves it the fans deserve it if they go let everyone know its going to end like on friends and let the finale be huge i say get donna and eric married i say have hyde and kelso fight and become friends again i say have something interesting happen between fez and jackie because fez has been trying for so long but of course it wont work out for him just close out the series big time guysbr br that 70s show will always be the best in my eyes eric kelso donna jackie fez hyde i wish i had you guys as friends you are the bestbr br 1010,1
i live and work in lexington kentucky the town where zombie planet was filmed id heard about the film forever ago from various people who claimed to be a critical part of the production then for several years i heard absolutely nothing imagine my surprise when i found it sitting all by itself at the local video store just itching for a rental so being the cinephile that i am i decided to give these local filmmakers a shotbr br bad ideabr br zombie planet is overlong boring poorly acted miserably shot and thats just the good stuff i tried my hardest to enjoy it which included removing my brain and setting it on the table so that it wouldnt get in the way of the horrible storyline alas nothing worked zombie planet is so bad its pathetic and the very idea that theyre planning a sequel leads me to believe that the director and his henchmen have listened to none of the criticisms im sure theyve heard move on you guys please in fact refrain from filmmaking altogether or attend a few classes on pacing storytelling and well basic directionbr br otherwise for the love of god hang it up,0
while the soundtrack is a bit dated this story is more relevant in the us now more than ever with not only blue collar jobs but everyones jobs being outsourced by us corporations while the government profits and american sufferbr br peter strauss is emory a steel worker who works the same job his father did for 35 years his wife is wellportrayed by pamela reed who is very realistic trying to support the family with two children when emory loses his job the mill is closed under the pretext of mismanagement but there is also embezzlement and cheaper wages where they can pay one steelworker in one month outsourcing what they would have to pay straussemory in a day never mind that these men are all good loyal workers who have values and try the best for their familybr br john goodman gary cole as strauss brother and a few other coworkers are also affected it is very disturbing and realistic some scenes between emory and his father are moving emory hopes his local union will be able to reopen the mill as they promise to do sobr br emorys brother lee already sees the writing on the wall there are no jobs left in the rustbelt ohio and they must move on however where in the us can they move to where will it be better for a bluecollar steel workerbr br there is a triumphant scene at the end where emory and his crew fill the loading dock with steel products the guard allows them to do this as a final gesture one of the men committed suicide and he has empathybr br overall a good message film about hard times right here in america something that few care to face until personally affected 810,1
about 4 years ago i liked this movie i would watch it over and over and over but now i dont actually i think this movie would have been great for mystery science theater 3000 it has a bunch of commentheavy actors macaulay culkin christopher lloyd patrick stewart whoopi goldberg and a pretty cheesy plot my favorite part is when culkin is riding his bike and he comes across a gang and a gang member says hey tyler where ya goin the moon also look out for the classic line do you have feeling in your toesbr br on the other hand its better than the good son,0
youd think the first landing on the moon would be dramatic enough without needing to make up stuff about it however this documentary seems to need to cast everything in the scariest possible light it talks about the risks associated with the lunar module and mentions armstrongs nearly fatal accident with the training vehicle as if the trainer and the spacecraft had anything to do with each other it makes the computer overload problem the 1202 and 1201 alarms encountered during the final landing sequence sound like a nearcatastrophe when it was just an annoyance and not a risk to the crew at all and it takes the thirty seconds call to mean thirty seconds of fuel left before running out when its actually thirty seconds before an abort is mandatorybr br if you want to see a documentary or dramatization of apollo 11 go for from the earth to the moon or one of the pbs documentaries but skip this one,0
its a good movie maybe i like it because it was filmed here in pr the actors did a good performance and not only did the girls be girlish but they were good in fighting so it was awsome the guy is cute too so its a good match if you want to the guy or the girls,1
i first saw this masterpiece on vhs 10 years ago and the powerful interpretation on angrykidpainfullyagainstestablishedsociety it carried stayed in my heart since then director hector babenco is such a good humanity who finds a delicate angle to tell the story of how urbanity kills the childhood of the kids from poverty class even the outcast kids have their innocent beautiful dreams but the corrupt reality never gives a chancebr br thanks to the publishers for the recent dvd release i now can keep this great movie to my favorite collection,1
this is a surprisingly great low budget horrorcomedy its funny and pretty well made with good performances and a really cool twist ending all the characters are pretty cool and the story while unoriginal is very good plus eric jungmannadam and justin urichharley had fantastic chemistry together one of the funniest moments in the film for me is when adam is trapped in the bathroom and harley wakes up to find that monster truck sitting there and decides to take a pss in the truck and aimee brooks is just plain sexy plus this is one of the best low budget horror films i have seen in a long time its very gory but in a comical way and i thought it was very well written as well plus michael bailey smith is fantastic as the monster man and had some wicked makeup its similar to films like joy ride duel jeepers creepers etc etc and it has some suspenseful moments here and there plus the gore effects are really well done for the most part this is a surprisingly great low budget horrorcomedy its funny and pretty well made with good performances and a really cool twist ending i highly recommend this one the direction is very good michael davis does a very good job here with great camera work good anglesgood use of colors and using a great setting plus he kept the film funny and at a very fast pacebr br there is a lot of gore we get extremely bloody nose bleedsgory impalings bloody stabbingsguy is cut in half by a monster truck human remains in a cooked stew guts all over the placeguys guts fall outpencil in the eyesbloody slit throatbunch of people walking around without limbsgory dead squirrelheads are squishedsevered limbsbloody and mangled corpsesdecent amount of bloodshedone very gory scene at the very end and morebr br the acting is very good for a low budget film eric jungmann is fantastic here as adam he was a nerd but a very likable one he had fantastic chemistry with justin urich had some cool linesand i just loved his character he also seemed to be enjoying himselfand he was especially good at the end justin urich is excellent as the ass of a best friend however i just couldnt help but love him as he was very funny and often stole a lot of the scenes i really dug him aimee brooks is gorgeous and did great with what she had to do she had good chemistry with jungmann and like jungmann was especially good at the end as i loved her mysterious character michael bailey smith is wonderful as the monster man he was very creepy looking had some awesome makeup and is now one of my favorite slashers rest of the cast do finebr br overall i highly recommend this one 12 out of 5,1
charles bronson has given the viewers lots of great moments on the screen but this movie lacks everything that a thrilleractionmovie should have there are a few action scenes in the movie but theyre really crappy and when the action scenes fail does the story save the film not at all is my answer to that the story is even worse than the action scenes its very straightforward and boring and even though im a big movie fan i almost fell asleep several times i dont know how they came up with a failure like this a low budget maybe regardless of that it looked like all the actors had no interest in being in the movie at all when that happens the result is really bad,0
of course the average scifi battle star gallactica fan will hate this that kind of makes me happy i dont like those cheesy scifi shows especially battlestar gallactica and that is why i like this showbr br the creators of the show got a lot of heat for making this the unconventional scifi way and it was worth it i read on wiki that they wanted to appeal to everybody including women and not just scifi nerdsbr br this is probably the most promising show since lost it has the most interesting clever and deepest script of any show in some time and it is truly uniquebr br what i love most about the show is that it kind of plays out like a great anime from young teens running around shooting guns to and extremely well balanced and complex script to robots it reminds me of something that came from japan except a little bit better most anime is too confusing,1
i had to walk out of the theater after an hour all i was seeing was people cheating on wives schtupping like dogs in a rut and using the fword like a diabetic using equalbr br no thanksbr br it was especially frustrating because the movie could have done a lot any one of the characters could have been quite interesting if they were given more to do than fornicate talk about it and swear at each otherbr br the few times that it looked as if there were about to be some sort of character development all that happened was another sex scene plot development in the 1st hour can be summarized as 1several murders occur 2 vinnie sees murder scene 3 vinnie stares moodily across atlanticeasthudson river 4 vinnie cheats on wife and 5 joey most sympathetic character in the show gets kicked out of his parents house more than that i didnt wait to seebr br the photography and the interplay between the characters were superb but there was nothing for them to do the flood of sex and vulgarity was hardly worth waiting another hour for something to happenbr br sorry spike take some lessons from notting hill or shawshank redemption either one is a better study in community and interpersonal relationships,0
its a puzzle to me how this turd of a film ever got distributionbr br sure its horror and theres a fair share of nudity but by god the production value is the lowest ive ever seen the equipment used is worse than standard home equipment everything is overlit giving everything an amateurish look bringing your thought to americas worst home videos or whatever that show was calledbr br please people is it too much to ask that you actually do an effort when you expect to waste 90 minutes of peoples lives watching this you really should have done some short projects first cause its obvious youre a bunch of amateurs 110,0
this film was really terriblebr br however its worth seeing as it features the worlds most unnecessarily extended sex scene ever i mean this thing went on for about 7 8 minutes repeating the same moves over and over thats almost 10 of the whole film i havent laughed as hard as i laughed at that for a long timebr br there were some seriously strange and pointless goings on in this film but the one that i found funniest was when for no reason whatsoever a helicopter lands and 5 or 6 guys in orange suits run in to the complex near the end 2 minutes later they run out again what the hell was that for also the tiny white forklift that magically changed into a huge yellow digger was pretty classic im led to beleive that this is because they used footage from the carnosaur trilogy to patch up this absolute donkey im gonna have to see those nowbr br the film is worth watching for a laugh or two but if you dont find bad movies funny stay away,0
i jotted down a few notes here on the first power lou lambada diamond phillips 1990 satanic serial killer yuppie hellfest br br 1 lou diamond phillips was recently indicted for beating up his wife and may serve time in prison i only hope that he can find armani prison wear to go off in style with one of the guilty pleasures of this movie is seeing his police detective clad in 4500 designer overcoats a 7300 designer silk suit and seeing his 3500month los angeles bachelor pad loft with interior design by mies van der roehbr br 2 leading lady tracey phillips has gorgeous porcelain skin flowing red hair that always seems styled even when mussed and amazing breasts that are hilighted in the 2nd half of the film by a designer silk pullover that sadly remains in place over her torso even when she was being prepared to be sacrificed to satan at least back in the 1970s our demonic killers undressed their victims before doing away with them though there is something to be said for leaving a bit to the imagination by the final 10 minutes of the movie all i could think about is what her breasts probably would look likebr br 3 professional psychics living in los angeles can afford 4 million dollar condos on mullholland drive overlooking los angeles with a view that would make brad pitt decide that he was roughing it as a matter of fact the condominium used in this film looks exactly like the same one seen in david lynchs mullholland dr which at least had the good sense to make its condo resident a successful movie director the only professional psychics i have encountered outside of this movie are all currently serving prison sentences for wire fraudbr br 4 i forget his name but the villain in this movie is wonderful and his hows it going buddy boy line could be the best overlooked movie phrase since thanks for the ride lady from creepshow 2br br 5 underneath major metropolitan cities there are huge vats of simmering acid that will explode into huge fireballs if someone throws a lit zippo lighter into them which is why major public waterworks plants all have no smoking signs plastered all over them even though the idea of smoking around water being dangerous is of course preposterous and since zippo lighters need to be manually filled with lighter fluid that can often leak out and be absorbed by ones clothing the idea of a carrying one in the pocket of your 7300 gucci silk suit strikes me as being much more dangerousbr br 6 the stunts in this movie are impressive to say the least and one of the fun things about watching it is remaining yourself that you are not viewing computer aided special effects but actual stuntpeople risking life and limb to contribute to a movie that earned nearly universal bomb ratings from critics when releasedbr br 7 movie satanists always amaze me here is a guy who has tapped into some,0
warning spoilers aheadbr br spoilersbr br ive seen movie in german so it might be that i missed some cluesbr br despite some weakness in the plot its a movie that came through to me i liked especially lexa doigs acting sometimes i got impression that she is camille but i cant stop wondering what happened at the end with bob cassie and baby i belive she after initially being set on bob eventually ended up loving him and regretting what happened with his brother and being forced to lie to him otherwise its a bit strange that she would carry his baby and love it its up to viewer to decide and i dont like such endings dean cain was as good as ever eric roberts well ive seen him better but also worsebr br i believe that the film is more an analysis of human relations and reacting in unexpected situations than a crime storybr br bottom line is i liked it very much,1
bravestarr was released in 1987 by the now defunct american animation company filmation on the back of heman masters of the universe and shera princess of power in 1983 and 87 respectively the plot of the cartoon was about a native american cowboy named marshall bravestarr who possesses the strength of the bear ears of the wolf speed of the puma and eyes of a hawk and his trusty sidekick a talking horse named thirty thirty who carried with him a gun aptly titled sarah jane and with the help of deputy fuzz and judge jb serve to protect new texas from the evil tex hex and his band of outlawsbr br set in futuristic texas this was and still is to this day one of the very few cartoons set in a particular city in the us hence in the south thousands of light years ahead in the future considering this was made in the 80s the creators did an impressive job trying to recreate the wild west look but from a scifi based outlook bravestarr didnt just evoke morality and good verses bad as well as teaching children lessons about life but it also highlighted themes of culture and community and that we shouldnt take things and life for granted and despite the fact that this was an action adventure cartoon many of the story lines themes and issues it addressed resonate with children and adults in a way that makes sense to them in addition marshall bravestarr was one of the very first major cartoon characters from a ethnicminority background to make an impact on tvbr br the sound effects were amazing the music was great the theme song equally memorable and the animation was wonderful the characters were well designed and the stories were diverse and taught kids morals and the importance of what is right and what is wrong something of which the same cannot be said about todays cartoons sadlybr br whilst bravestarr was overshadowed by the success of heman it is still a personal favourite for many 80s cartoon fanatics suffice to say i preferred bravestarr over heman because of the diversity of the story lines characters and that the depth of the situations and problems that the characters faced themselves were more what i would say realistic and identifiable in contrast for some reason they resonated more with people because like for instancein the pledge where a kid dies from a drug overdose the fact that there wasnt a happy ending was important in the sense that when kids watch that episode well in fact anyone who watches that episode will realise for themselves the devastating consequences of drug usage and that no one should underestimate the dangers of drugsbr br bold brave and at times thoughtprovoking bravestarr is definitely that bold brave and thought provoking a cult cartoon classic for many years to come it dared to take some risks but it had well and truly paid off in the end it will be remembered by many cartoon fans as one of the,1

this film is much the same as cannibal holocaust if it werent for the needless animal killing in the name of shock ooh look at us were hardcore weve added real death to our films these films would make their way onto my dusty classics shelf im a huge fan of cannibal films and zombies but as it stands its another example of shock horror clutching at the last straws of the pile in a desperate effort to make a poor film generate more hype to sum up a crusty gore flick with limited appeal a fan of 70s gore should give this a try but anyone with modern ethics and tastes should pick something a little better written for their popcornfest,0
a drama at its very core anna displays that genuine truth that all actors age and sometimes fade away anna is a character that believes america is her safety net her home and it can do her no wrong but she refuses to belittle herself to do work she doesnt believe in she is hardnosed optimistic stubborn and arrogant when it comes to her life yet not afraid to let others in yet drop them at a moments notice anna flipflops between personalities which makes this film ideal of an aging star but not idea of the viewing audience anna has been praised for its star sally kirkland and her ability to get grungy for the role but a month into 2008 anna does not remain a staple of film culture it is dated dull and formulaically chaoticbr br director yurek bogayevicz has a message hidden within anna about the falsehoods of czechoslovakia both politically and socially but kirkland refuses to let them upstage her bogayevicz is not afraid to play with the camera to use wooden frames to allow kirkland to stand out and he is not afraid to lessen the surrounding characters so that when you walk away from the film it is kirkland you remember if it isnt obvious this film didnt sit well with me from the opening of the first act and deep within the second anna felt like a high school theater production the characters were nonexistent there was no enlightening prestory and there was no definition of time or place there was sally kirkland stubbornly saying that she is better than the other actresses vying for the same lifestyle that she wants randomly she encounters a friend a young girl that has also traveled a long distance to get to america for the glitz and glamour and two of them within the span of 20 minutes build a friendship that could break all walls it is emotionally boring and unbelievable again randomly we meet annas boyfriend daniel played by the weak robert fields who brings nothing to the table in terms of definition or character only to boost the attention onto kirklands anna through the course of nearly two hours we watch as more random acts coupled with unnamed characters intertwine together to feebly create a story that is held together by loose threads and sally kirkland arg it pains me to continue to say this but anna could have been a fantastic film had bogayevicz presented equal time between anna daniel and krystina but instead we are forced into a onesided game where emotional scenes speak louder than plotbr br is this where charlize theron found inspiration for her beautyless role in monster or halle berry in monsters ball was sally kirkland one of the early actresses discover that by letting themselves go for a character oscar will shine in their direction throughout this film i was disgusted by kirklands portrayal of anna and bogayeviczs lack of excitement for anything else fluent bogayevicz gives us an anna that doesnt work hard for her parts,0
when i was 17 my high school staged bye bye birdie which is no great surprise since it is perfect high school material and reputed to be the moststaged musical in the worldbr br i was a music student and retained strong memories of the production and its songs as well as a lingering disregard for the dick van dyke movie version which had deliberately obscured the elvis references and camped it up for a swinging 60s audiencebr br so when the 1995 version starring jason alexander hit my cable tv screen i was delighted with what i saw alexander turns in an exceptional performance as albert a performance in strong contrast to his betterknown persona from a certain tv series the remainder of the cast are entertaining and convincing in their roles chynna phillips is perhaps the only one who does not look her part supposedly a naive and innocent schoolgirlbr br but best of all the musical numbers familiar from the stage show are all preserved in this movie and performed as stage musical songs should be allowing for the absence of a stagebr br so if you know the musical and few do not then check out this telemovie it does the stage show justice in a way which can probably not be bettered which is good enough for me what is better than rendering a writers work faithfully and with colour and style,1
lost is one of a kindits so enchanting and full of suspense thrill and emotions all at the same timei have never seen any tv series like this before it is full of jungle thrills and has a good screenplay the actors have emoted life on an island in such a natural way that i feel lost in the island myself while watching itit is an excellent piece of work narrated in a very intelligent formthe series is like a movie depicting the life of the survivors lost on a deserted islandi am tempted to watch one episode after the other and i highly recommend this series for all the tv show loverswatch it to see the magic of being lost in nowhere,1
people get a clue i mean the writers dont have one so i would expect you tothis show is such a pale imitation of the 60 show that you can laugh at it and the sixties show is the one with the cheap special effects and is in bw fer chrissakes yet the mood and the writing on the old show is miles ahead of this drivel get hip kids if 98 degrees or brittany told you to watch it you would you know it just bypass them and tell all your friends you were in with the scene before it became too cool,0
after seeing the batman dead end short i didnt know what to really expect from worlds finest of course superman and batman all my worlds finest comic books have them as the teamupbr br after seeing this 3andahalf minute trailer it made me wish someone would make a serialized fan film for worlds finest if not an actual fulllength filmbr br sure some of the superman stuff was cheesy but movie trailers in theaters are always teasers giving you only certain aspects of the entire product this looks like it needs a complete productbr br other than director sandy colleras relative playing an achingly poor perry white most of the actors were unknown if an actual movie was made actors would be cast to fit the bill for the film though i believe nina kaczorowski would make a good lois lane especially if given closertothecharacter dialoguebr br good to see clark bartram wearing the batman costume from dead end but it should be updated a bit more and not be like the 40s batman with the 80s90s leather cape and cowl his demeanor is batmanlike but i still wonder about the validity of white contact lenses instead of just allowing his eyes to show through the mask i believe the goal was to get it as close to the comic character than the movie personabr br michael ohearn cannot play superman period he stands around with a goofy look on his face that simply says slap me and line delivery seems to be a problem with himbr br overall though i would love to see a complete story and film based on this ingenious piece of work there was a rumor about a worlds finest movie being made and with the correct additions to the script this could be it hope more like this are made,1
of the many problems with this film the worst is continuity and reediting it on vhs for a college cable channel many years ago i tried to figure out what exactly went wrong what seems to have happened is that they actually constructed a much longer film and then chopped it down for standard theatrical viewing how much longer to fill in all the holes in the plot as we have it would require about three more hours of narrative and character development especially given the fact that the film we do have is just so slow and takes itself just so seriouslybr br thats staggering what could the halperins have possibly been trying to accomplish here their previous film white zombie was a successful low budget attempt to duplicate the early universal studios monster films the mummy dracula etc and as such stuck pretty close to the zombie mythology that those in north america would know from popular magazinesbr br revolt of the zombies to the contrary appears to have been intended as some allegory for the politics of modern war this would not only explain the opening and the change of dean jaggers character into a megalomaniac but it also explains why the zombies dont actually do much in the film besides stand around look frightening and wait for orders theyre just allegorical soldiers not the undead cannibals weve all come to love and loathe in zombie filmsbr br i am the equal to any in my dislike for modern war and its politics but i think a film ought to be entertaining first and only later maybe educational and definitely a film about zombies ought to be about zombiesbr br truly one of the most bizarre films in hollywood history but not one i can recommend even for historic value,0
this movie is all about subtlety and the difficulty of navigating the evershifting limits of mores race relations and desire granted it is not a movie for everyone there are no car chases no buildings exploding no murders the drama lies in the tension suggested by glances minimal gestures spatial boundaries lighting and things left sometimes very ostensibly unsaid its about identity memory community belonging the different parts of the movie work together to reinforce the leitmotifs of self and other identity desire limits and loss it will reward the attentive and sensitive viewer it will displease those whose palates require explosive massive spicy action it is a beautifully filmed human story that is all,1
i went to see this film last night at the national film theatre in london as a birthday treat it was the the first time ive seen it and i think it has now overtaken the dreadful twister as the worst film i have ever seen disjointed for no reason self indulgent and full of imagery that oscillates from the crass and obvious to the obscure and unintelligible not particularly beautifully or grimily shot i really dont understand why this is considered classic gay or otherwise i normally enjoy films that push boundaries or even films that are hard to watch because of their length or unusual cinematography but this was truly truly awful,0
ive seen some very terrible horror movies in my time and while this isnt the worst of the bunch its certainly in the lower half the script starts off ok a young doctor goes to a hospital as an intern hoping it will vault him to a better job for him and his future wife cute huh the movie then heads straight into the toilet when you realize that something is killing patients turns out that theres a demon on the basement thats harvesting peoples souls its the job of the 1 doctor 1 nurse and 1 security guard in the entire hospital staff to drag this mental patient downstairs do a ritual that pretty much just involves cutting the tongue out and then allowing the haunted house prop of a demon to come out and steal his soul through the magic of cheesy special effects at this point the movie gets so ridiculously stupid i was begging for it to be over there was still an hour to go it looked like a half an hour tales from the crypt episode that somehow got stretched into an hour and a half crapfest from tiny lister doing his best john coffey the green mile impersonation to tracy scoggins playing the stereotypical frigid nurse ratchet this movie fails in every possible level i gave this 2 stars for only two reason 1 his fiancé is pretty hot she eased the pain a little towards the end and 2 the movie actually looks ok a lot better than the current trend of horror movies being made with walmart quality home camerasbr br in the end avoid this turd even if you have the blockbuster movie pass which i do and i still felt cheated as a bonus drinking game you and your buddies take a shot every time matt stasi dr james bishop shakes his head while talking youll be drunk 15 minutes into the movie,0
this movie contains personalities that so deliciously are playing their parts i love the final when nobody knows what are they gonna do about their life but its completely great when you see and realize that the priest is right is jut for two so what are the other persons doing there the movie embrace you to a new life to experiences to be able of dream with the other person and reach those dreams also shows you the life itself hard like it is but gives you the option to choose what you want and what you really need hope this comment works for you the movie it did worked well for me i bought the movie by the way take care,1
this is a pale imitation of the die hard franchise that just sucks the low ambitions of the movie are clearly on display when the terrorists hold the vicepresident hostage and he has to call the white house to beg them to transfer some money in most movies of this genre the president is kidnapped or held hostage because after all he or she is the most powerful person in the country with finger on the nuclear button etc etc would most americans have really been worried if dick cheney had been kidnapped the honest answer is probably not why the terrorists would choose a stanley cup final to carry out their operation and why despite many explosions around them the audience inside the hockey stadium is oblivious to the situation are unanswerable questions lets just say this film is really hokey not hockey those who liked the film and found it to be exciting should get a life,0
i regret that ive seen this movie cant believe that the creator of best intentions and pelle the conqueror could make such a bleak and boring film what a waste,0
unbelievable i never saw something like that everything is bad really bad from photography lots of scenes without focus to the acting the young female is terrible and what can we say about those helicopters made in paint brush really amazing b i mean z filmbr br the plot are bad cliché and bad wrote basics conveniences to the screenplay seems to work i cant even think a young student of cinema making this movie nothing justify itbr br i recommend that you dont even think to see this movie sleep or play solitary are best choices br br xxx,0
spoilers the film sniper is undoubtedly based on the exploits of legendary us marine sniper carlos gunny hathcock the unassuming softspoken mister rogers lookalike who ran up a score of as much as 300 confirmed and unconfirmed vietcong and north vietnamese military kills during his two tours in namwhich shows just how deadly and effective a trained military sniper really isbr br tom berenger is cool clam and deadly as sgtthomas beckett whos at the end of his career as a top us marine sniper but who later in the movie realizes that a life as a civilian will be pointless since theres nothing outside for him to do with his skills that he learned in the us marines unless he decides to become a mob hitman backett reluctantly accepts his fate as a lifetime professional killer for his countrybr br the story of the film sniper is focused on sgtbeckett with the assistance of former sharp shooting silver medalist and us government agent richard miller billy zane being sent deep inside the panamanian jungle the two snipers are to take out rebel general miguel alveraze frederick miraglittoa and colombian drug kingpin raul ochoa carlos alveraze whos supporting him in a planned a military takeover of the country br br we see earlier in the movie sgt beckett scope and take out a rebel leader which i feel was the best scene in sniper for it shows step by step how sgt beckett with the help of his spotter cpt papich aden young does his job theres also a subplot that was later aborted in the movie about a rebel sniper desilva eward wiley who was stalking beckett and who later killed papich as they were both waiting to be lifted out of the jungle by a military helicopter you would have thought that a deadly cat and mouse was being played out between the two that would culminate when the movie ended but sgt beckett had no trouble at all in dispatching desilva early in the film by using an unsuspecting miller as baitbr br what hurt the movie the most was ironically the last fifteen or so minutes when the story went from a one shot one kill sniper movie to a rambolike ending with sgt beckett and agent miller fighting off an entire battalion of rebels with bullets flying as thick as a london fogbr br sniper is still well worth watching for the fact that it tells the story about a person who until now has not really been glamorized in war movies a solitary killer who kills with the precision and skill of a master diamond cutter or accomplished neurosurgeon and who does it in total secrecy,1

crack house 1989 was one of the few film during the 80s that falls into this genre whats supposed to be an antidrug film turns out to be nothing more than some whiteexploitation exercise in depravity theres nothing wrong with that however the video presentation even has an antidrug message from one of the stars of the show richard turncoat roundtreebr br the movie follows two young lovers in high school one of them is a quasi tough guy and the other is his girl one of them gets turned out by a mutual friend whilst the other is given a trip to the slam and is later on given a chance to get back at his exfriends jim brown appears as the movies mister big hes one bad dude who still can punkout anybody and is a very sadistic guy who likes to smack his hoes and beat the tar out of those who try to defy his word luke from general hospital makes a guest star spot as wellbr br if you like hard edge sleaze then this movies for you sadly hollywood doesnt make these any more and when they do its neither exploitative nor entertainingbr br recommended for sleaze fans,1
an excellent cast makes this movie work all of the characters are developed exceedingly well and its clear that the actors enjoyed filming this moviebr br its not quite the comedy i expected much more a lighthearted look at the attempt to reclaim youthful glory than bawdy humor for music fans there are quite a few subtle references that in themselves are intelligently funnybr br i hate drawing direct comparisons to other movies but so much of this movie reminded me of alan parker films i cant help it imagine if the commitments actually did make it big and then tried to recapture said glory 25 years later,1
i would have enjoyed this movie slightly more had not been for jason herb evers constant harping on experiment many early reviewers of the seven samurai accused toshiro mifune of overacting yet as more and more critics viewed that film they saw it as being purposefully done jason evers is obviously not toshiro mifune and his overacting is exactly thatbr br most of the actors in this b classic were rather good actors minus evers and the showgirls if you watch this movie you would have noticed evers shouting almost every line that is until he is smoking and blowing the smoke coolly out his nose br br the special effects were par for the course in a b movie such as this one in hindsight there isnt much that stands out in my mind as fantastically good or bad for this movie,0
i was at the same screenwriters conference and saw the movie i thought the writer sue smith very clearly summarised what the film was about however the movie really didnt need explanation i thought the themes were abundantly clear and inspiring a movie which deals with the the ability to dare to face fear especially fear passed down from parental figures and overcome it and in doing so embrace lifes possibilities is a film to be treasured and savoured i enjoyed it much more than the muchhyped somersault i also think mandy62 was a bit unkind to hugo weaving as a bloke about his vintage i should look so good i agree that many australian films have been lacklustre recently but peaches delivers the goods im glad i saw it,1
i had been avoiding this movie for sometimebecause i viewed it as an unneccesary installment to a series that should have only had 2 parts but after reading some fairly favorable reviewsfrom some imdb watchersi spent 150 and rented it at my local video store need i go furtherwhen i saythis was a buck50 lost this movie is one of the 10 worst movies i have ever seen first offi realize that noone wanted to see a 33 year old macchio in this filmbut why couldnt they have had miyagi read a letter or something from danielsanmaybe explaining what happened to danielhell they could have at least made a quick mention of daniel or something but noand to compund the already bad scriptthey added those stupid monksi thought monks take a vow of silenceguess these yapping monks dont take their vows seriouslyhehehe the training the girl went through in the movie was hurried and stupidand the paramilitary group of young maleswere a confusing concept to say the leastthis was far from even being a martial arts moviewith the girl only fighting briefly in the final sceneand then she didnt even come close to getting hit even onceby the male fighting hergive me a breakshe would have gotten hit at least oncei guess the writers and directors thought it would be to shocking to see a girl get punched by a male in this one i could go on and onbut basicallyill end by saying that this movie was just so badeven the girl they chose wasnt nice to even look atshe was sorta butch lookingi can only think of a handful of movies that i have sit throughthat compare to just how bad this flick wasdont waste your time on this one,0
two funeral directors in a welsh village english humour as opposed to that other stuff from over the atlantic how could i resist my wife and i saw it on march the 6th for our belated valentines day celebration and both of us enjoyed some good belly laughs we were going to see another movie later but decided not to because we wanted the experience of this movie to stay with us for the eveningbr br the mortuary scene in the last 20 minutes of the film is worth the wait it raises issues rarely talked about in the community but i know three funeral directors and the humour is right on the moneybr br highly recommended and congratulations to the writers without you all the actors directors and the others havnt a job on any monday,1

the turner classic movie channel has spent the month of january doing the films of one of my favorite actors robert montgomery his films are mostly rarely watched these days except for those that were atypical for most of his career meaning that the roles that frequently reappear on television are they were expendable the lady in the lake june bride night must fall the saxon charm ride the pink horse rage in heaven the earl of chicago in short the films he fought to get the roles in because they were not the usual comic fluff he usually appeared in its ironic that nowadays when one thinks of montgomerys career it is the films that were mostly made after 1937 that are pushed the ones that broke the original image that mgm and louis b mayer pushed the pity of this is that montgomery was a gifted comedian and saved many films from being routinebr br petticoat fever is one such film made in 1936 with picadilly jim and trouble for two it was a banner year of good performances by montgomery and helped lead to his being able to convince the powers that be at mgm to allow him to play danny in night must fall the next yearbr br petticoat fever is set in labrador and montgomery is a weather station operator there named dascom dinsmore he has been living there for five years and has not been in the company of a woman except for inuit women for most of that time he has a girlfriend of sorts named clara winifred shotter who he sort of proposed to but its been two years since he has heard from her so that he believes she has given up on himbr br dinsmores world is rocked when sir james felton and irene campton reginald owen and myrna loy show up they were flying to toronto for a business meeting that felton was to address felton is engaged to campton but dinsmore finds her enchantingand gradually she finds him equally attractive certainly the pompous selfimportant and hopelessly inept felton is no competition it is a measure of owens acting that he keeps the character entertaining even if one finds it hard to believe such a boob is a canadian captain of industrybr br there is something surreal about this film probably due to the original play while the labrador scenery is quite phony looking it does serve its purpose for the comedy witness th polar bear sequence but the height of the surrealism is the dinner dinsmore serves his guests a dinner of pemmican steaks which owen eats with real gusto owen a minor noble as a baronet is dressed in normal clothing a winter suit for the climate but montgomery is dressed in his suit of evening dress as though attending a ball at the embassy loy seeing him dress up likewise puts on a gown they are being served by dinsmores servant assistant the inuit kimo otto yamaoka who is wearing a suit of evening dress too it turns,1
the acting is good the women are beautiful and the men are handsome so if youre looking for wellacted soft porn this movie is for you otherwise you are wasting your time the motivation of the main characters in particular the eponymous lead is often a mystery she could have just told the truth the truth as presented in the film not necessarily the historical truth and her lover would have been spared time in jail for a rape he did not commit was she protecting her father who went off halfcocked as it were when he impetuously instigated a malicious lawsuit was she protecting herself with her reputation suddenly of concern when heretofore only her art seemed to matter during the trial this strongwilled woman turns to mush before our eyes conversely her lover who starts off as a narcissistic jerk becomes a selfless hero during the trial at least his motivation is clearer he sacrifices himself for love naturally since no good deed must go unpunished we are told that she never sees him again,0
after reading the book heart of darkness the movie did not do it justice the movie puts the book to shame and anyone who has not experienced the book would frown upon the story and plot because it was portrayed so poorly by the movie in the film the characters and set were just some of the let downs that occurred in the movie the director left out so many important and interesting aspects of the book that made it one of the best literary works ever madebr br of course any book is better than the movie but these werent even comparable joseph conrad as a writer was brilliant in vocabulary and the cleverness of the written word the movie doesnt even start to show any of this some of the very important and influential scenes from the book were completely left out like how kurtz was not in the boat when he died also when marlow went to deliver the news to kurtzs intended she reacted differently in the movie rather than the book another major difference was that marlow saw the picture of the lady that was blindfolded at the end of the movie not at the beginning like the book this was influential on how the audience perceived marlow and the movie totally messed that upbr br the book was so fine tuned on what every location looked like but the scenery in the movie was a let down there was a bunch of cheesy fake backgrounds and to compliment a bunch of bad actors to go along with it there was one exception to the awful actors and that would be isaach de bankolé who played mfumu his character was depicted the best though the movie wasnt that great i still would recommend it only if you have read and understood the book very well that way you can see what the differences are in the movie and book and contemplate them if you have not read the book i do not recommend the movie because it is a boring lifeless mess i loved the book so you should definitely read it and enjoy it,0
you know before seeing this film i had little sympathy for those caught up in criminal cases i mean if they were arrested and charged they must have been guilty i reasonedbr br i formed this opinion over some years you see a good friend of mine once worked as a detective in some of the more seedy areas of sydney he frequently complained that his policing efforts were wasted due to bleeding heart lawyers and magistrates he would bang the crooks up in the morning and they would be back on the street by noon it took its toll they wore him down he quitbr br he has argued since not unreasonably i thought that creative evidence gathering to keep the baddies where they belong was well acceptable br br my arguments about the rights of innocent people werent valid he claimed what are the chances that you will ever be arrested and charged with a serious crime he would argue and being a law abiding citizen the weight of his argument convinced me he was right the chances of me or any of my family or friends being charged with murder or a serious offense were zero to none i thought br br hmmmmm well as mentioned earlier seeing this wonderfully enlightening documentary changed all that br br im sending him a copy,1
i may not have the longest of attentionspans but this is the second movie i have refused to see all the way through and i even bought it on dvd because of its classic status br br at first i thought that the director was playing a big joke so i kept waiting for a resolution something to laugh at something to keep my interest but this resolution never came rather the writing was laughably amateurish the movie dragged on and felt disjointed like someone cut a tv series to featurelength the academy must have been on drugs when they nominated this movie for no less than eight oscarsbr br once again i repeat myself this is the second movie i have refused to watch all the way through the first was exterminator i hope this gives you an indication of how bad it really is 110,0
i wanted to see this movie because i liked kavkazskij plennik prisoner of the mountains and brat brother with sergey bodrov jr and vor the thief with vladimir mashkov well unlike the other movies the quickie was a total waste of time the story that makes little sense very uneven acting lesley ann warren was especially bad really awful dialogs poor cinematography what else could go wrong i find it amusing that in practically every americanmade movie when the samelanguagespeaking foreigners russians in this case are left alone they prefer to communicate with each other mostly in broken english and when they happen to speak russian for some reason translators feel obligated to add a lot of fks in the sentences which have no profanity literal or nonliteral at the same time nativeenglishspeaking actors choose to speak in broken russian why is that getting back to the story most of the subplots of the movie eg betting the house inviting latin american paramilitaries etc either make no sense or do nothing more than confusing the viewers it is too bad that bodrov mashkov and leigh all good actors in my humble opinion got themselves involved in this disaster,0
this film is absolute gold if you havent seen it do mani ratnam outdoes himself once again this film introduced me to nandita das as well though everyone shines in this movie my only regret is ive never found a copy with subtitles to the lyrics of the songs we are led from the jungle of northern sri lanka to the serene beaches of southern india as well as from the terror of war to the ultimate conquest by love of the human heart beautiful subtle witty with a few hidden surprises waiting for the viewer this movie stands up to being seen again and again and the story within the story the umbrella is done so well as we watch the scene unfold from drawings in a book lovely watch it,1
the couch trip is one of those silly comedies that they cranked out in the 80s in this case dan aykroyd plays a mental patient who poses as a psychiatrist and he goes to beverly hills to sub for charles grodin most of the movies humor springs from their satirical look at beverly hills and peoples empty lives there a woman has a power struggle with her maidbr br its the sort of movie that you just watch to have a good time dont expect any kind of religious experience but youll most likely laugh a lot at how the beverly hills people flaunt their wealth also starring walter matthau donna dixon arye gross and victoria jackson of uhf,1

zane and beringer will keep you on the edge of your seats i dont typically go for militarywar movies but this was worth my timebr br it was serious but it was also humorous beringers character proved to be heroic and honest no matter what you know that hes got your backbr br zanes character developed throughout the film he wasnt just a suit he definitely proved that he could be a hero and handle a gunbr br the ending through me a little though it didnt really go with the action throughout the film but im glad that i saw it nonethelessbr br its worth checking out,1
i hadnt seen this film in probably 35 years so when i recently noticed that it was going to be on television cable again for the first time in a very long time it is not available on video i made sure i didnt miss it and unlike so many other films that seem to lose their luster when finally viewed again i found the visual images from the pride of the marines were as vivid and effective as i first remembered what makes this movie so special anywaybr br everything based on the true story of al schmid and his fellow marine machine gun crews ordeal at the battle of the tenaru river on guadalcanal in november 1942 the screenplay stays 95 true to the book upon which it was based al schmid marine by roger butterfield varying only enough to meet the time constrains of a motion picture this is not a typical war movie where the action is central and indeed the war scene is a brief 10 minutes or so in the middle of the film but it is a memorable 10 minutes filmed in the lowest light possible to depict a night battle and is devoid of the mock heroics or falseness that usually plagues the genre in a way probably ahead of its time the natural drama of what happened there was more than sufficient to convey to the audience the stark ugly brutal nature of battle and probably shocked audiences when it was seen right after the war this film isnt about glorifying war i cant imagine anyone seeing that battle scene and wanting to enlist in the service not right away anywaybr br what this film really concerns is the aftermath of battle and how damaged men can learn to reclaim their lives theres an excellent hospital scene where a dozen men discuss this and i feel thats another reason why the film was so so well receivedit was exceptionally wellwritten theres a dream sequence done in inverse negative film that seems almost experimental and the acting is strong too led by john garfield garfield was perfect for the role because his natural temperament and schmids were nearly the same and garfield met schmid and even lived with him for a while to learn as much as he could about the man and his role actors dont do that much anymore but added to the equation its just another reason why this movie succeeds in telling such a difficult unattractive story,1
i thought that the nadir of horror film making had been reached with book of shadows i was wrong this film makes that look like the magnficiant ambersons compared to this piece of shameless unexpurgated fecal matter that has the audacity to call itself a movie id write more but im still to angry that i was idiot enough to spend 3 renting it bobbinsbr br and were these people english and where is the forest i have lived in the uk two thirds of my life and as far as i know there are no dark uncharted woodlands in the midlands the whole bally thing looked like a national trust conifer plantation those angels looked like anorexic pornstars turned most of them were did my research i did however like the bit when judd got ripped in piecesbr br ps i love and admire tom savini but he cannot act,0
i kept waiting for this film to improve but alack this is the worst kind of escapist movie a spunsugar confection that sinks under the weight of its own ponderous selfimportance the pace stumbles on like a legionnaire stranded in the sahara the absence of good dialogue leaves the appealing stars with little to do other than look good in white linen irons plays yet another moneyed charmer whos had a touch of the sun kaas is a pleasing singer but not much of an actress luckily the script does not often call on her to emote away from the jazz club microphone all the enviably relaxed pretty unnecessary characters take turns masticating the scenery with an air of weary sophistication the whole exercise comes across like an interminably long ralph lauren ad br br if youre past forty and believe francophilia is the key to sophistication you may well mistake this piece of cardboard for a baguette well if you liked this movie you probably felt smart for appreciating godards leaden éloge de lamour and you may even have sat through le divorce without cringing,0
this is the movie that finally pushed me over the line into registering with imdb so that i could vote for and comment on it ive only recently come to appreciate wellproduced war movies and this is one of the most thoughtful ive seenbr br stunning is the word that comes to mind when i think of this viewing experience my husband and i watched this film last night for the first time it is gently moving yet exciting at the same time not a contradiction this story in the hands of hollywood could have become just another smarmy actionpacked top gun timewasterbr br the two lead actors playing frantisek and karel played off of each other marvelously well and krystof hadek is a very pretty boy without seeming to exaggerate or exploit that fact in terms of hadeks acting ability and appearance my husband said tongueincheek well hes no tom cruise i replied thank god if you appreciate beautiful and understated acting see this one,1

pet sematary though a nice 80s horror movie with a nice director and atmosphere is a copy of the italian movie zeder by pupi avati its clear that stephen king has copied almost all the ideas from this director the movie zeder was made before king wrote the bookbr br the cat the ground everything was copied this is a case of plagiary but being stephen kind a famous american writer its totally normal that he can get away with this its obviously due to the huge difference between this kind of italians movies with no budget and in part its crap itself but the original idea i repeat it its italian director avatibr br let the world know,0
twenty years after watching this i still find myself quoting things from this movie like look between the two giant melons or ill start to sing the pabst blue ribbon theme on the other hand 20 years later i can now make sense of the meat machine as theres still a lot of the stereotypes like this out there that they used for this movie those are signs of a good movie to me i could say this movie stands the test of time which i cant really say for a lot of 80s movies i continue that this movie is still on a list of a lot of peoples favorite movie as a kid growing up in the 80s if you like games and have dreams of becoming a game master or find yourself dorking out over these 80s movies to relive your childhood you need to watch this also its sometimes sarcastic and funny but one things for certain about this movie if someone ever invites you to a great allnighter they dont mean an x or acid trip party they mean get ready for some midnight madness oh youll see everyone will be dying to play hehehehheh,1
this is not a very good telling of the tarzan epic there was only one reason for this movie john derek wanted to show off his beautiful wife in the buff bo derek in 10 was at least a humorous movie and there was a reason for nudity and sex this movie is nothing more than soft porn if youre into that well then fast forward to it and skip the rest this movie like bolero was again a vehicle for bo derek to show off her terrible acting she is undoubtedly a beautiful woman but a poster of her is more exciting than this movie richard harris was a better actor than this this was one of his few mistakes dont waste your time on this moviego buy the book instead,0
every episode i saw when i was an innocent child was stupid there were some funny looking puppets called the mitts who would always discuss childhood things they would play this song before the mitts part of the show that goes like this lets join the mitts there was a groucho marx puppet that told jokes before the session this man would sing hot fudge right on there was a green puppet with teeth that was called seymore we would always see more seymore he would crack jokes and sing every episode there was always a moral in every episode one episode a man sang liars are losers another episode he was singing about sharing and caring seymore said tell me about those two little girls sharon and karen the hot fudge holey moley part has this man doing weird stuff and they played weird music,1
this film by the wellknown czech director and writer collaborator petr jarchovský is remarkable for its particularity but annoying and distracting in its details taking its theme and title from a robert graves poem it deals with a woman with several men and some obnoxious relatives in her life whos trying to survive and protect her two children 15yearold lucina michaela mrvikova and little blond asthmatic kuba adam misikthe poem is much in evidence but the themeit gets a little lostbr br marcela anna geislerová the beauty and jarda roman luknár have lost everything in the prague floods of 2002 and have nothing left it seems but good sex which they go at with such a vengeance in their tiny apartment that lucina and kuba in front of the telly must hold their ears against the noise hrebejek relishes such explicitness and skates on the edge of embarrassment or shock theres no good explanation precisely why but financial desperation has led jarda to processing stolen cars in the big garage that adjoins his flatlet his carthief cohort drives off a posh volvo the easygoing benes josef abrham has left with the keys in the ignition while visiting a large property he owns benes is a supernice guy but no fool his volvo is wired for tracking by satellite in cases like this and that leads the cops straight to jardas garage and he and his cohort are off to jailbr br beauty in trouble flees to the good angelon whom she can rely begins the graves poem but actually this fracas leads benes to marcela when he meets her at the police station he introduces her to sushi and how to drink wine and plies her with a picture book about tuscany where he though pragueborn owns a lovely villa and has lived most of his life hes here to reclaim the house in prague now occupied by a couple with an ancient and infirm mother whom he allows to remain benes every gesture is benevolent even though he doesnt prevent jarda from going off to jailbr br in the circumstances marcela must retreat with lucina and kuba to depend on the charity of her mother zdena jana brejchova and the far less tender mercies of zdenas present husband the scrawny diabetic richard hrstka jiri schmitzerwho for the kids starting when they commit the cardinal sin of consuming his dietetic cookies proves to be the uncle from hell jiri schmitzer hijacks the film at this point and never quite lets it go even in the final scene he is a figure of leering menace it is surprising that the obnoxious richard doesnt sexually abuse one or both of the children he is insistent that marcela needs to get out on her own and when benes offers to take her under his wing he and richard become improbable allies improbableperhaps implausible why should benes like him but then what is beness whole story about some things the film gives too much information and about others not enough br br clearly the good angel,1
some spoilers if you are a big horror movie fan then you will know that halloween paved the way for many slasher films often imitated never duplicated this movie is a true horror classic and is definitely one of the scariest movies ever made if not the scariestbr br i actually saw this movie after seeing the rest of the series dont ask me why i honestly saw the other 7 movies before seeing this one thats just how it worked out but i would have to say this one blows all the others away it is genuinely frightening and seeing michael pop out from behind a bush or walk around in the dark sends a chill down your spine my favorite part of the movie was when michael stabs a guy and leans his head to one side it is one of the eeriest images in movie historybr br later slashers such as the friday the 13th films were more fun and less intense than this movie i do like the f13 series better than the halloween series but this movie alone is better than all the f13 movies michael myers is such a scary villain because he is realistic you could imagine a crazed guy like him going around killing people i admit this movie gave me nightmares after watching it for a few nightsbr br whats great about this movie is that it doesnt rely on gore or humor to entertain the audience it is just pure terror its too bad the later films of the series swayed from this one because this is as good of an example of a spectacular slasher movie as they come,1
i voted 3 for this movie because it looks great as does all of greenaways output however it was his usual mix of art sex and pretentious crapi know lots of people like this film but i grew tired of it very quickly it is definitely not for everyone the ubiquitous mcgregor obviously took the part for crediblitys sake i guess but he really should not have wasted his time i hate to consign anyone to pseuds corner but please on the plus side it is visually very attractive and i enjoyed the music but could not see it through to the end and i cannot say that for many movies i usually watch the whole thing but this is unbearable,0
an apt description by spock of an allpowerful fop into whose clutches fall the crew of the enterprise this was one sector of space our starship should have avoided first sulu kirk simply disappear off the bridge a landing party follows them to the surface of an unknown planet and encounter trelane a seemingly aristocratic man dressed in attire from an earth of many centuries past but he demonstrates abilities of someone or something far beyond human and doesnt register on mccoys medical tricorder the officers manage to escape back to the ship but like some bad cosmic penny trelane keeps popping up he brings them all back including some female companionship to continue his games the dilemma now takes on elements of the most dangerous game out in space and theres an exasperating even infuriating aspect to the crews utter helplessness before such unbridled powerbr br what really makes this a great episode is the memorable performance by guest star campbell as the overpowering but not allknowing alien his character is obviously an early version of q who was introduced 20 years later in the pilot for the tng series trelanes confrontation scene with spock stands out among all the strange drama which unfolds as usual kirk quickly begins to look for possible weaknesses in his new nemesis despite being quite outmatched the answers to exactly what or who trelane is are right in front of us the whole time so when we do learn the truth it makes complete sense in view of campbells pitchperfect acting he indulges himself constantly preening before some unknown audience remarking on things with a flair which is infectious but not quite right we cant quite pin it down at first but theres something missing here every few minutes his tone becomes sinister and the crew now appears to be in serious danger in a way you cant take your eyes off him always waiting to see what he does next actor john de lancie captured that similar tone as q on the next generation series,1
in 1974 the teenager martha moxley maggie grace moves to the highclass area of belle haven greenwich connecticut on the mischief night eve of halloween she was murdered in the backyard of her house and her murder remained unsolved twentytwo years later the writer mark fuhrman christopher meloni who is a former la detective that has fallen in disgrace for perjury in oj simpson trial and moved to idaho decides to investigate the case with his partner stephen weeks andrew mitchell with the purpose of writing a book the locals squirm and do not welcome them but with the support of the retired detective steve carroll robert forster that was in charge of the investigation in the 70s they discover the criminal and a net of power and money to cover the murderbr br murder in greenwich is a good tv movie with the true story of a murder of a fifteen years old girl that was committed by a wealthy teenager whose mother was a kennedy the powerful and rich family used their influence to cover the murder for more than twenty years however a snoopy detective and convicted perjurer in disgrace was able to disclose how the hideous crime was committed the screenplay shows the investigation of mark and the last days of martha in parallel but there is a lack of the emotion in the dramatization my vote is sevenbr br title brazil not available,1
i thoroughly enjoyed carmen better than original sin angelina jolie antonio bandaras which share some thematic similarities and which i also enjoyed very much i felt the acting was stronger here paz vega displayed a wider range has more fire and sbaraglia was also great overall their acting was more gritty more believable less dreamy than original sin and both actors here had less celebrity status and pretty face to depend on to make the movie work vega definitely sizzles as to be expectedbr br director vincente aranda has also built a detailed world again better than original sin that lets you feel the grime and the daily goingson of archaic spain for example people unloading goods from a cart on the street workers changing the candles of the street lamps all in the background of the action br br whilst i greatly sympathize with the recent idea of redeeming our femme fatals like brian de palmas femme fatale carmen is a poignant modern take in the tradition of the noir classic double indemnity and is a delightful pleasure to watch this is another fine example of the triumph of daring european cinema over glitzy and safe hollywood fare,1
its funny your worst nightmare always seems so far away br br dark habours characters a married couple alan rickman polly hunter and a vagabond norman reedus are slipping into a game full of hidden sexual energy and treason nowandthen tantalizing breaks increase the tensions and give much space for interpretations good acting and a story which if not using the brain will leave you in confusion you have to watch it twice at least the very strength lies in its unconventionality and in alan rickman of course those who love him will love this moviebr br conclusion it is not a typical prime time movie but well done,1
i cant believe i am so angry after seeing this that i am about to write my first ever review on imdbbr br this disney documentary is nothing but a rehashed planet earth lite now i knew going into this that it was advertised as from the people who brought you planet earth but i had no idea they were going to blatantly use the exact same cuts as the groundbreaking documentary miniseries i just paid 875 to see something i already own on dvd shame on disney for not warning people that there is absolutely nothing original here save a james earl jones voiceover and 90 seconds of sailfish that i dont believe were in planet earthbr br but the biggest crime of all is that while planet earth uses the tragic story of the polar bear as evidence that we are killing this planet and a catalyst for ecologic change disney took that story and turned it into family friendly tripe after the male polar bears demise they show his cubs grown significantly a year later and spew some garbage about how they are ready to carry on his memory and that the earth really is a beautiful place after all no mention of the grown cubs impending deaths due to the same plight their father endured no warning of trouble for future generations if we dont get our act together nothing just a montage of stuff we have already seen throughout the movie and many times more if you are one of the billion people who have already seen planet earthbr br i have never left the theater feeling so ashamed and cheated in my life,0
i nominate this and babylon 5 as the best television scifi series made both stand out in my mind because unlike early star trek series there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters if you look at the original star trek and star trektng they were fine shows but there was no overall theme or plot that connected all the episodes in many ways you could usually watch the shows totally out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what is occurring this was less the case with deep space 9 with its giant battles that took up all of the final season and the other trek shows as there was more of a larger story that unified them this coherence seems to have developed as a concept with babylon 5 and saw this to an even greater extent with sg1 the bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form sure there were a few throwaway episodes that were not connected to the rest but these were very few and far between and were also usually pretty funnybr br and speaking of funny i loved that sg1 kept the mood light from time to time and wasnt so dreadfully serious in this way i actually enjoyed it more than babylon 5 jack oneill was a great character with his sarcasm and love of homer simpsonits really too bad he slowly faded from the series in later seasonsbr br to truly appreciate sg1 you should watch it from the beginning and see how intricately the plots work this coherence gives the show exceptional staying power and if you dont like sg1 after giving it a fair chance then scifi is probably not the genre for you,1
if you like bad movies this is the one to see its incredibly lowbudget special effects youll see what i mean and use of nonactors was what gave this film its charm if youre bored with a group of friends i highly recommend renting this b movie gem its mulletrific,0
based on tom wolfes satirical novel that was praised by all i have not read it yet tom hanks stars as a wall streeter who accidentally kills a black boy while lost in a bad part of nyc willis stars as the reporter who starts hanks on his downward spiral the characters are very thin and there seems to be no empathy for anyone in this movie and for a comedy or a satire there arent a lot of laughs eithermelanie griffith had her breasts done during filming so a fun thing to do is to see if her boobs change size during different parts of the filmthis will keep your mind off other things like the lack of script or humor on a scale of one to ten3,0
rois et reine is a sprawling mess of a movie which will probably irritate as many viewers as it delights it focuses by turns on exlovers nora emanuelle devosand ismael mathieu amalric as they each confront a major crisis in their now separate lives while noras story is played straight and is sombre in tone ismaels is played mainly for laughs although its not particularly funny noras crisis is triggered by the terminal illness of her father louis maurice garrel and ismaels by his sudden incarceration in a mental hospital at the instigation of a mysterious third party ismael and louis are just two of the males who have shaped noras life and in turn have been shaped by her the most notable others being her now deceased first lover pierre and their young son elias as events past and present are played out for the audience and the exlovers become involved in each others lives once more it gradually emerges that noras personal take on her life story may be less reliable than first meets the eyebr br cult director arnaud desplechin has fashioned a considerable oddity here one which has garnered major plaudits in france he wilfully eschews established narrative convention and develops the movie via a series of dramatic shifts in mood and tone had this approach been founded on a coherent unifying core idea or theme it might have worked but its not clear in the end what exactly desplechins film is actually about heavyhanded allusions to greek mythology and freudian theory are evidently freighted with meaning but at least for this unschooled moviegoer remain less than helpful in illuminating and interpreting the lives of the characters at other times the treatment lapses into kitsch but the use of the anodyne moon river as the films theme tune suggests this is probably deliberatebr br spoiler alert i suspect a major theme of the movie is the not very original observation that how we see ourselves can differ radically from how others see us or even how we think others see us this idea is most obviously represented in the film by the violent death of pierre and the revelation contained in louis secret diary but unfortunately both events seem entirely disconnected from what has otherwise been revealed to the audience of pierre and louis respective relationships with nora this seems a cheat on desplechins part as if he is thrusting the idea upon us in unmediated form rather than illustrating it more subtly in the natural course of the narrative one or two darkly surreal touches imply the presence of an alternative but largely unconscious world of persons stripped frighteningly bare but again these are felt more as pretentious intrusions of filmmaking technique rather than eruptions from a deeper reservoir of truth inherent in the story in fact for all its heavyhanded hints at depth the characters are curiously undeveloped and unnuanced as if they function more as ciphers for their creators many ideas about people rather than as real people in their own right much of the,0

i find this movie very enjoyable the plot is simple and easily digestible the humour is light and clean and because the storyline involving mistaken identity is quite common i find myself looking forward to how this movie flesh this story out turns out to be very nice the performance of the female lead is admirable her portrayal of an innocent naive girl trying to fabricate some white lies to davids sophisticated role was very charming i also find veras dancing very very well done i find myself drawn to her toes as she pranced about the stage effortlessly and flawlesslybr br for those who have had enough of profanityfilled movies of today you will enjoy this movie thoroughly,1
just a dumb old movie first stanwycks son gets his foot trapped in a really dumb way and then her husband gets his foot trapped in another really dumb way in an effort to save him stanwyck gets unlucky yet again and comes across an escaped convict she has a chance to kill him but fails in a very dumb way in the end her husband is saved and stanwyck tells us through narration what the dumb message of the movie is alls well than ends dumbbr br i could never figure out how an unattractive woman like stanwyck ever made it as a leading lady in hollywoods glamouroriented golden era that nose is so beautiful so photogenic the film is mercifully short running a little over an hour its as though the director sensed that he was making crap so he thought it best to keep the crap short,0
as ive hopped from film to film at the sxsw film festival this film from the opening night has stayed with me curious because it is a dark comedy with quite an absurdist premisebr br a family of hyperstressed fundamentalists in a small community of like minds is changed by an auto accident three of the four have the same neardeath experience in which they are fully opened as each receives a reversal of the concept of original sin i wont spoil this scene with the specifics the fourth a middle school cheerleader is not just the only one physically hurt but also is unchanged and is now witness to what has become her crazy apparently spiritually bankrupt family every new moment brings a new outrageousness as they have become innocently naked and frank in every way horrifying her and then the communitybr br forgiving the franklins has the most beautiful sexual awaking scene between a husband and wife that i have ever seen to the sarah brightman song deliver me a song that can now bring tears to my eyesbr br the cast is terrific robertson dean as the dad vince pavia as the son and aviva as the cheerleader daughter are excellent mari blackwell plays peggy the moms questioning neighbor and best friend perfectly a much more nuanced fleshed out real character than what might have been everyone in middle america knows a peggy and theresa willis positively glows as betty the mom there are lots of risks taken by the actors playing the three changed characters and these risks pay offbr br i hope this film gets a wide release if so i plan to see it againbr br very accurate review at httpwwwfosteronfilmcomphilforgivinghtm,1
as is frequently the case when manga is translated into live action there is quite a bit lost in the translation however this remains a highly entertaining film the premise is unusual and it is presented in the quiet understated style so prevalent in japanese films ha the special effects are a little 70s camp but it adds to the comic book feel of the film i wouldnt recommend this film to everyone but if you are familiar with and enjoyed other japanese horror films like evil deads trap this film will appeal to you,1
what a night perry mason then have gun will travel followed by gunsmoke when it was a half hour and finally at 1030pm came sea hunt with its wonderful opening theme music and mikes boat sailing off to a new adventure terrific regardless of the story it was the lead character played by lloyd bridges strong honest sincere a mans man and a boys man this brought on an interest in boats that lasted for years why they dont show on cable or make it available on video no idea too bad,1
zero stars out of br br endless descent has absolutely no redeeming values whether its the ridiculously bad acting the laughably awful special effects the incompetent direction the stupid script or the gratingly annoying musical score its the kind of pitiful production that makes me wonder how a movie like this could even have the slightest consideration for being greenlighted by a studio in the first placebr br i dont think im going to delve into the plot other than to say its about a bunch of people who are trapped under the water and have to kill a lot of fakelooking creaturesbr br let me go more into detail as to what is so awful about this flick first of all the acting is simply horrendous jack scalia is ten times worse than sylvester stallone a feat that is hard enough to accomplish as it is the supporting performances arent really any better and what is with actor luis lorenzo the guy who plays the cook francisco he has a highpitched voice and an accent that sounds appropriate for a comedy not a scifi horror filmbr br the special effects are even worse the creatures range from weirdlooking eels to giant starfish and mostquitoes the effects look like something you would see in a muppet movie and i dont believe i need to delve further in this issuebr br director jp simon has slight cult status because of all the terrible films hes made im sure some will enjoy endless descent in an ed wood type of way but i dont even think its that good everything he does is shoddy especially the camerawork the man cannot direct a movie thats all there is to itbr br this was the last of four films that took place underwater and it sure does make leviathan and deep star six both bad films in their own right start to look masterful in comparison either way just stick with the abyss,0
flatland is one of my favorite books thus i was looking forward to this film unfortunately the film is absolutely horrible the dialog is so bad it sounds like improv half the time the new storyline makes me think they took the book and a couple of newspapers threw them in a blender and used what came out for the screenplay its a disgrace to the book and independent film making the only reason i even managed to get all the way through the film was my hopes that itd get better unfortunately it only got worse climaxing in a really retarded endingbr br thats not to say everything about the movie is bad the cg is acceptable in a 1990s reboot sort of way which i assume is what they were going for and i suppose you cant go wrong with people getting chopped in half and gushing blood all over the place,0
a story about love and hate tragedy and happiness and most of all friendship set in the very interesting time of the american civil warbr br gets you interested in history gets you emotionally involved and makes you feverishly wait for the next episodebr br moreover the casting was splendid many superstars appear in short cameos the leading roles are played by a big array of talented mimes kirstie alley and terri garber should be mentioned here this is simply a superb example for a tv production as it should bebr br not to forget the sheer loveliness of wendy kilbourne portraying constance,1
a nice shirely temple short child actors screaming their lines seemed to be the norm for that day and time perhaps being seen and not heard needed to be made up for aside from that this is fun given the films era there are certain aspects of the thing from a social viewpoint that strike me as both very progressive and liberal i wont go into those here id rather not spoil it for you but let you watch it for yourself and see if you spot those elements as early on as it was its easy to see from this short the fascination that was already developing for temple that makes it worth watching if youre a temple fan for others its a cool way to kill ten minutes while youre waiting for your good night glass of milk to warm up on the stove,1
dear me where do i start the dad isnt anywhere near old enough to be the girls dad he corpses on camera in the first 5 minutes of the film the favoured exclamation in this film is jesus christ zombies are agile stupid and few and far between motives are utterly incomprehensible and a narrative does not exist people rush to their destination in jeeps driven at 3 mph the world seems to be carrying on as normal yet these are supposed to be the end days breasts appear for the sake of breasts normally such an approach would provide some redemption but the rest of the film actually made me uninterested in breasts or the future of humanity theres a dog for no reason and thin orange blood that turns the stomach the general and his catchphrase of shut the fk up is the only redeeming feature as for the rest i sincerely hope to hear that they had done the decent thing and killed themselves,0
this is the final episode we deserved at the end of the last season things were left in a life goes on mood which was hardly the wrapup that this realistic series deserved while not a happy show this series was always one that made you think a rare thing on television and this is no exception is death justified by reasoning are morals reflective of society or is society shaped by the morals that are selected by the few in power what is a just death and can it exist all of these questions and more are posed by the writers of this show every week and this is their final thesis fine acting great writing wonderful camerawork brilliant editing clean direction if you have seen the series and you missed this when it first ran then get a hold on a copy somehow if you never watched the series when it ran then this will stand up on its own but it may be heavy going trying to keep up with who all the characters are and what they are alluding to in their varied pasts for those of us who were avid viewers of the series in the last two seasons this is very satisfying viewing,1
this is probably the only movie i have ever not been able to make it all the way through not only was it annoying and boring but the low production values made it hard to make out the action and in some cases the dialogue avoid this one like the plague,0
1st watched 10292006 4 out of 10dirjohn stephenson mildly entertaining story of a group of five kids who are forced to live with their eccentric uncle while their father and mother fight work in world war i as england entered the war they are told not to go in the greenhouse of the uncles mansion which of course they do over and over and they discover a sand fairy who them daily wishes that only last until the sun goes down this is the it referred to in the title created by the jim henson group and voiced by eddie izzard the problem is their wishes usually bring about other problems that they are supposed to learn from this part of the movie is not done very well because its obvious the children primarily the freddie highmore character do not learn from them but instead keep going back to it to solve their next big problem it is not nearly as funny as it could have been with the comedian eddie izzard really not given much opportunity to improvise and kenneth branagh is wasted as the eccentric uncle although he is the best character the children are fine as far as their acting abilities but the story probably would have been much better going into the fantasy realm but they did have a human story to tell as well which probably caused the confusion with the filmmakers so all in all this was an ok film but could have been much better,0
i rented this movie because i hoped it would be one the whole family would enjoy although the movie is family friendly my family did not enjoy it because it gives a false view of god if you obey god and follow him you are not guaranteed success your football team wont always win you wont magically get better grades infertility isnt always cured you wont always get a raise sometimes youll be stuck with the old carbr br god does not exist to meet our every whim rather we were created to glorify him sometimes we glorify him most when things seem to be going bad for us to live is christ to die is gain,0
warningi advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this commentbr br when i first started to watch this movie my expectations were it was a vampire movie that is going to be awesome considering how rodriguez and tarantino both helped make the film i began about 15 minutes into it and already my hopes for this movie were down the drain which shocked me first the story it was going with was not at all appealing in anyway possible and just flat out boring and uncompelling to the point where i just wanted to turn it off i was getting more frustrated with this movie as it dragged on but i guess i had hopes that it would get better then when it finally showed vampires it blew my mind in a very bad way i thoughtokay this movie started with some backwash horrible story about these two criminals then very slowly turned into some vampire movie which i thought it was going to be from the beginning in like the last 30 minutes to add on to that they try to make the main characters all cool and awesome and mean around the end when theyre just not a bunny wouldve been more intimidating than these characters this movie is a horrible piece of crap from dusk till dawn disgraced me and left a terrible taste in my mouth disheartening thoughts in my head and left my body unable to move from the horrible shock that i just wasted 108 minutes of my life away on a horrendous film i do not understand how george clooney quentin tarintino cheech marin and danny trejo all being the good and honorable actors that they are could take part in this useless filth in my opinion from dusk till dawn is one of the worst movies ever made that i have suffered my eyes on do not see it youll be doing yourelf a great favor,0
i have yet to see a film with nolte in it that i did not like however this being said hes made a lot of films and ive seen just a few in my minds eye i am keeping the images of his performance here and the one in the thin red line nolte has a a full range of acting talents when its necessary to shout he roars like a wounded lion his best moments are the ones i treasure in actors when he just emotes through facial hand and body gestures without saying anything having come to the conclusion that our present generation of actors by and large have no appreciation of what an actor can do without speaking having no conscious appreciation of the mastery of keaton and chaplin this generation of actors relies far too much on the mechanical wizardry of computers of course it is also just a sign of the times we live in had chaplin lived in our timeswho knows he just might as well have become an aficionado of cgi toolsbr br i have not read the vonnegut novel from which this film comes to the screen however the plot is not so far fetched or convoluted that we cannot follow the path laid even with all its surprises of course on the outset it appears preposterous however it is also not impossiblebr br consider these for starters a spy at the heart of the third reich he extraordinary life of fritz kolbe americas most important spy in world war ii by delattre and prichard look at amazon for more details consider history undercover piercing the reich american spies inside nazi germany dvd i saw this here httpstoreaetvcomhtmlproductindexjhtmlid75054 seems to be a history channel productionbr br so is the story ridiculous far fetched yes impossible no back to the plot noltes character is recruited and accepts an impossibly dangerous mission and unfortunately the script does not give us an adequate reason why he accepts was it a type of passivity that he got sucked into this role as it says because it was the best story he had ever written and he got to play the part thats a hard thing to imagine any of us would grasp but it was an unusual time and people did extraordinary thingsbr br the acting throughout the film by the entire cast is excellent and as people have pointed out alan arkin always fantastic is very good in a small rolebr br i was really shocked by the ending of the film no i wont spoil it and it made me feel terrible about the choice did this person feel that the road was finally over and that he had spoken all that was necessary and that any more would be chapters added to a life already filled with many burnt pages hard to say but it really joltsbr br nolte gives one of the finest performances you can expectthe premises of the film make you wonder about a lot of things its very entertaining and provoking,1
this flick is strange but i liked it a lot its about a good girl who loves her bad boy and their messed up honeymoon he doesnt love her back and hes a mean son of a bitch he starts to love her after some really whacked stuff happens on their honeymoon i wont give it away its weird yeah but different than other movies in a good way i think i dont know what to compare it to but its a love story but has lots of funny stuff too like get to see james franco in a wig i liked the notebook a lot and it kinda felt like that because of the love story but the rest is way different nothing like that sienna miller is really good i saw this movie at a test screener because i like her a lot and her fashion i liked her in factory girl but this is a better movie than that was her and james franco look really in love in this movie and i hope they are together in real life but dont knowbr br see it,1
there seems to be only two types of reviews of this film on the net those who hate it and curse ralph bakshis name and those love it and call it work of genious im inclined to be in the middle iam forced to agree with most of the criticisms of this film egthe cruel cutting of the story badly rotoscoped charecters over acting etc but dispite this i still love this film the rotoscoping when done properlyadds an eerie lifelike dimension to the charecters and the final battle scene at the end of the film is fantastic the surrealistic scenes when the nineriders chase frodo are stylish and well executed and the musical score magic sadly the bad points outweight film but if you can bring yourself to ignore them it is a great filmbr br no doubt ill be lynched by an angry mob of people who hate this film after writing this review ah well such is life,1
father of the pride is a pleasant surprise it is funny witty and features some great voice acting the show is about the family of a lion who is acting as the attraction of siegfried roy shows indeed all of them are stereotypes but thats what makes them so funny fotp is not a kiddiecartoon it includes some crude adult humor but in a very mild way it is full of popculture references and celebrity cameos and most of them are very well executed id say ill give the show a 7 out of ten because it is nice fairly well executed but not very original ive seen most of those stereotypes many times before even in that particular order,1
what a lousy movie took me 3 times to finish it the thing i disliked the most was the infantile sense of humor jokes made by a 10 years old child not funny pretty annoying actually for example when the detective cant get a place at the bar he yells shes taking it all off and then they all run fast foreward slapstick kinda rush so stupid and also a guy sitting at the bar smashing fruit to work out his post traumatic stress disorder on the bar and the bartender is supplying him with more and more fresh fruit thats supposed to be funny and i mean i love good ol exploitation gore flicks and saw a lot of terrible movies but his one is plain bad and also the gore is not that exciting dont bother i wouldnt recommend it,0
its great to see jorja fox in a role where she gets to smile a lot also loved hearing her sing nice change to see her out of her csiwest winger roles the movie itself was entertaining but it seemed skip some explanation in a lot of parts several of the characters seemed to be miserable one minute and happy the next and it was left up to your imagination to figure out why each character was quirky though and in some cases i couldnt wait to see what they would do next or hear what they would say next this movie wasnt full of squeaky clean people but rather complicated realistic people who could make mistakes feel bad about them and then find a way to fix them,1
this film is the best film jim carrey has ever made carrey did not have his usual face making stuff in this film he was both funny and sad carrey played a reporter named bruce nolan nolan blames godmorgan freeman for everything that goes wrong in his life then god comes down from heaven and gives bruce his powers as i said before carrey did an excellent job i also thought that morgan freeman and jennifer aniston were great as supporting actoractress the plot was good because it had many subpoints in the main point this movie can be funnybruces dog as well as sadthe breakup the script worked well too i am glad they made a sequel to this film i rate this film a 910,1
people please dont bother to watch this movie this movie is bad its totally waste of time i dont see any point here its a stupid film with lousy plot and the acting is poor i rather get myself beaten than watch this movie ever again,0
it is so sad even though this was shot with film i think it stinks a little bit more than flicks like blood lake theres nothing out there the music they play in this is the funniest stuff ive ever heard i like the brother and sister in this movie they both dont try very hard to sound sarcastic when theyre saying stuff like my friends are going to be so jealous hey whats with the killer only wearing his mask in the beginning thats retarded i practically ignored the second half of this my favorite part about this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer is using the axe the same exact sound for every chop,0
everything in this film is bad the story the acting the effects but its funny funny funny scott valentine with the army uniform thats ten sizes too big is so bad with the permanent attempt at a scowl on his face as the leader of a special ops group its hilarious the terrorists are as scary and realistic as the raptors this is so phoney and bad at everything it tries you have to laugh the part where the giant trex who somehow snuck on board a ship and then somehow got below is blown up and you see the metal pole sticking up where its head was is the perfect ending if your into bad films this is the pot of gold the mona lisa of bbbad,0
this is one amazing movie you have to realize that chinese folklore is complicated and philosophical there are always stories behind stories i myself did not understand everything but knowing chinese folklore i studied them in schoolit is very complicated you just have to take what it gives youenjoy the movie and enjoy the ridehooray,1
a cryptozoologist captures a mythical chupacabra on a caribbean islandto get it back to civilization he bribes his way onto the cargo bay of a large luxury cruise ship with funny and i think the script intended disastrous resultsbr br lets start with the one thing i really did not like about this movie the monster really just looked like a guy in a rubber suitthe cgi scenes looked like a different movie ok thats off my chest now onto all the enjoyable bits about this b moviebr br the best thing was john rhysdavieshis daughter the eye candy a close secondjohn was intermittently funny and suave and no matter what the writers made him say he said it wellgood job given what he had to work withthe cyptozoologist was over the top and fun to watch toohe had some funny bitsthe marines all were ok and make good cannon fodder for the monster as did some of the crew and gueststhere are a few pretty funny lines in this movieand a pretty amusing sub plot involving a thiefbr br the special effects are generally med to low and i swear they reused the same blood spray on the wall scene in about four different parts of the movie i did like the gore of the legless manreally since this movie was not scary at all i feel a bit more gore would have gone along way in improving the watch ability of this moviebr br all in all if you like b monsters this one is worth a visit,0
when you make a film with a killerkids premise there are two effective ways to approach it you can either make it as realistic as possible creating believable characters and situations or you can make it as fun as possible by playing it for laughs something which the makers of silent night deadly night did for example on an equally controversial subject a killer santa the people who made bloody birthday however do neither of those things they simply rely on the shock value of the image of a kid with a gun or a knife or a noose or an arrow in hisher hand the result is both offensive and stupid the whole film looks like a bad idea that was rushed through production and then kept from release for several years its redeemed a tiny bit by good performances from the kids but its very sloppily made 12,0
i think the romance of this movie helps couples develop a deeper appreciation for each other although i saw one goof in the early part of the movie it was fairly well done the plot can make you cry if you think about the situation enough i loved itwatched it twice already and highly recommend it,1
how could anyone who liked the previous jp movies even stand to sit through this 1 hour of drivel there are so many stupid things about this film its mind boggling i remember when i went to see jp as a kid it was my favorite movie and franchise the acting the sfx the music the direction all fantastic jp2 in my opinion was ok pretty much the same apart from some really stupid moments like the gymnast girl kicking a raptorplease but on a whole a watchable and reasonable cinematic experiencebr br but the the third one has no point its supposed to be a sequel that carrys on from jp2 and yet it magically includes brand new things to the franchise that would have been impossible to miss on the previous 2 films for example 1 the new mega spinosaurus seriously what the hell this thing follows them everywhere they go they cannot escape its presence and yet in the lost world the same island do you see it once do you hear it does anyone even mention it no its ridiculous the star character in the previous 2 movies was and always will be the trex so what does the durrirector joe johnston go and do kill it off as soon as you see the huge trex in all its awesome roaring glory it gets killed and you never see it again a new dino on the town is the excuse where did it come from not a single explanation and dont get me started on the whole satellitephoneinthedinobelly thing 2just when you start to get over how stupid the spinosaurus is you see the raptors aside from their new punk haircuts they seem pretty credible phew they will make this movie watchable right wrong now they speak to each other and the excuse for them speaking in this film and not in the first and second arewait for it evolution yes the process of millions of years in just a few months from when the second movie ended amazing surly they should have grown opposable thumbs and created tools by now ok i am not going to say anymore about the plot because its getting up my nose so i will close on this jurassic park is a classic jp3 is a lousy sucker punch to any of the original fans of the series my favorite franchise was well and truly dead after watching this monstrosity no pun intended avoid this movie like the plague,0
to begin with i really love lucy her tv show still makes me laugh she was one of the greatest comedians who ever lived right up there with chaplin and keaton but her performance in this movie is disappointing she was too old and the gauze filters on the lens make her look like a london fog refugee she couldnt sing and her voice was so froggy that she croaked through every song her dancing days were long in the past just because you are a lucy fan dont gloss over this mistaken sad performance and sing its praises i prefer to remember lucy in her wonderful tv seriesi love lucy and to draw the curtain of charity over the terrible mess of a movie called mame,0
this is one of the unusual cases in which a movie and the novel on which it is based are both great maybe this is because gorris takes nabokovs initial ideas and gives them a different interpretation the final consequence is a point of view over luzhin which dignifies him more than the nabokovs onebr br the only thing in the movie which i dont like is the influence of valentinovs on luzhins destiny i cant imagine nabokov creating a person like valentinov and giving him so great influence on novels argument,1
when i first watched the show the first few episodes seemed promising bill compton introduced himself as the stereotypical mysterious vampire and sookie presented herself as an independent woman however the show went downhill from here and the once interesting characters are as entertaining as a cardboard boxbr br as the story progresses the main characters lose their original personalities along with their acting abilities by episode 5 bills furrowed eyebrows are so low that his face just consists of a forehead sookie or rather the actress is even more dead than her vampire lover all these tragic events are surrounding her and she only reacts to how enjoyable it was losing her virginity personally i think they made the main characters sleep with each other too early in the show the way they teased each other was something that had me hooked and could easily be toyed with a bit more as soon as sookie loses it she struts around like a total ditz only thinking of bills libido and the size of his appendage bill also loses his debonair attitude and well he just gets plain silly his actions are never really explained except he does it for sookie why their love for each other is never delved into if there is any love so far it just seems to be sex that is the core of their relationshipbr br yeah yeah vampires usually equal sex but come on every five seconds i see some sort of humping going on it wasnt that much of a surprise since hbo always tries to pass of a soft core porno as a decent tv show bill popping out of the dirt and just getting it on with sookie with no reason whats so ever i laughed so hard i almost peed myselfbr br the plot is just a stream of consciousness the characters never go into detail about anything all the events that happen are usually left unexplained the only thing that is constant is the sexbr br the only thing i can say that i do like are the minor characters tara and her drunk mother are far more interesting than the major characters the only reason why i continue to watch the show is for the development of the minor characters br br minus the sex and the main characters the show would be much more worthwhile,0
one of my favorite lines in shakespearebr br ie were not finished with you by a long shot so not only does shylock not get his pound of flesh or the 3000 or the 6000 or the 36000 each of the 6 parts were a ducat ducats in a matter of minutes he is ruined by having to forfeit all his possessions and his daughter has long abandoned him alreadybr br vengeance is a dish best served cold but shylocks attempt at revenge totally backfires br br i suspect this play was and is popular because it caters to the wish we have for justice but the hard reality is the world is engulfed in injustice and most of it stands a few big names get tossed in jail sme gang punks lose their turf to the good guys but in reality most of the time its the other way aroundbr br but not in this play the long howls of racism and antisemitism forgets that it could well have been any other social outcast group that gets the comeuppance its just that the money lenders of the time were jews and therefore the needs of the story line puts shylock the jew into the role of villainbr br merchant of venice is my 3rd favorite work by shakespeare 1 and 2 being hamlet and macbeth this production gives excellent treatment of the moral of the story the scenes with the suitors alone is worth watching also the awkwardness of the new husbands squirming and minimizing the fact they let the rings so easily slip away that they had sworn to keep forever in real life this trick is the thing that spouses coyly use to remind their better half that promises must mean something and not be made frivolously there is far deeper significance to this play than just the comedydramatic aspect it is about loyalty commitment and lovebr br well worth watching over and over,1
yes the votes are in this film may very well be the plan 9 from outer space for our generation but whereas ed woods film for all its flaws retains a certain charm despite it all this film defines the word charmless to the nth degree in fact id suggest to the editors of the oxford english dictionary to cite this movie as a key example defining the that word in the next update to the dictionarybr br carrot top is a performer of such abysmal ability that normally rational people that i know once they hear his name become homicidal maniacs dedicated to wanting to kill mr top as soon as possible indeed if one goes to amazoncom and look at customer reviews for carrot tops movie and other performance dvd one will find several that could be construed as death threats to mr topbr br one other curious fact about this film i recall that mike nelson the head writer for mst 3000 in his book mikes mega cheese about movies good and bad said he saw this film and shortly afterwords couldnt recall a thing about it including the title obviously mike was suffering a classic reaction to trauma viewing this atrocity was so soul numbing mike nelson had to block it from his mind evidently in a later chapter in his book mike nelson had recovered his memeory of this film from the review he offers mike nelson was definitely not grateful for the recovered memorybr br the only comment i offer about the film and it is not a spoiler its simply gods honest truth its not funny none of it is not even a nanosecond of it is funny,0
obviously written for the stage lightweight but worthwhile how can you go wrong with ralph richardson olivier and merle oberon,1
the title suggests that this movie is a sequel to an american werewolf in london none of the characters from the previous movie return and arent even mentioned in this movie by name so as a sequel aawip fails one would saybr br i dare to say the oppositebr br an american werewolf in paris is a charming effective horror movie its one of the better werewolf films i have seen in a long time too and i have seen quite my share such as an american werewolf in london the howling wolfen the wolfman and the underworld trilogybr br the story tells of three americans visiting paris on a vacation at the top of the eifel tower one of them saves a woman trying to commit suicide what starts out as a romantic relationship slowly turns into a nightmare when the dark secrets that lurk in the city are revealedbr br i really liked the acting in this film especially the two stars of the movie the woman who tried to commit suicide and the guy who saves her they have good chemistry together but the other two americans also play their roles nicely i didnt really find anything annoying about the acting so thumbs up for that br br the effects on the werewolves are nice it doesnt look too cheap or fake to me of course the opinions are divided about this subject but lets just say that i wasnt disappointedbr br theres also a good amount of humor in this movie there are some really funny scenes you will probably remember for a long timebr br so to sum it up an american werewolf in paris might not be a direct sequel to its predecessor but its still an enjoyable movie perfect for fans of werewolves 7 out of 10 stars,1
ted danson was a great choice to play gulliver even though his background was mostly comedy he shows here that he can do drama just as well or perhaps even better though there is a lot of humour in this hard to turn a blind eye to his american accent especially since his character is supposed to be english but thats just a minor thingbr br all the villains are equally well cast james fox edward fox peter otoole warwick davis john standing etc despite the fact that most of them are either tiny people or giants they are 100 believable in everything they do and their motivations are very clear eg the lilliputians unremitting suspicion of gulliver grildrig the giant dwarfs hatred of him for usurping his position as court jester dr bates attempt to have gulliver proved insane so he can marry marybr br mary steenburgen is great as mary gulliver another 17th century english character with an american accent but never mind she is a deeply tormented character because she has been waiting nine years for her husband to return home and when he finally does he is talking about tiny people giants a flying island and talking horses mary despite the strong fantasy element in the story is a very believable characterbr br the special effects are breathtaking especially when you consider that it was filmed on a television scale at a time when cgi was in its infancy it looks very realistic when we see a 6 foot tall man walking through a city filled with people who are 6 inches tallbr br the cameos are great as well omar sharif richard wilson sir john gielgud kristin scott thomas ned beatty all great actors who create a strong supporting cast that complement dansons superb acting abilitybr br the houynhnhms and the yahoos are probably the most effective element of the story on the satire side of things a society of talking horses who do not possess any of the vices that humans have while the yahoos are primitive disgusting humans who mate forcefully and appoint their leader depending on how disgusting he is gulliver and mistress study of them is also very well done and displays the differences and similarities between humans and yahoosbr br the best version of gullivers travels by far and one of the best miniseries ever,1
i really liked the idea of traveling between dimensions and i even liked the wadequinn tension in early episodes some of the worlds they created gave the main characters extremely interesting backdrops for their stories however as the show went on there were more silly disputes among the friends and less of a true bond there was less wonder and excitement when they were involved in other worlds and more condescension and every world had one of the characters falling in love the writing just got boring and everything was way too over the top too bad it wouldve been nice to have a closely knit band of friends a la star wars traveling to different dimensions on tv for several years rather than a tired band of knit pickers,0
an excellent series masterfully acted and directed but unloved i am told by mr deighton and withdrawn by him after a single presentation it is now only viewable in private collections and via the british film institute at special request very unfortunate as ian holms nuanced portrayal of the wearybutdetermined bernard samson is superb one of his very best performances the supporting cast including the young amanda donohoe and hugh fraser are superb with mel martin playing the conflicted and traitorous wife and michael degen as the mercurial werner the story positively simmers with the tragic and fateful personal consequences of the great game,1
this movie made me so angry here i am thinking that heres a new horror movie one wa sense of intelligence then the movie starts the scenery the delivery of lines the costumes the fake gore must i go on there are porno movies out with better dialog than this i understand the concept behind indie movies but my goodness this wasnt just indie this was a high school book report shot wa camcorder the cast are all friends relatives this is 1 movie that was doomed from its beginning maybe if it was 1982 instead of the new millennium this movie could fly but it seems to me that someone hung a rock around this albatrosss neck it was sinking at a constant rate of speed,0
ok i would not normally watch a farrelly brothers movie i cant recall ever watching one i also dont recall watching a jimmy fallon movie alright i did watch taxi but i said penance and was forgiven for that mistake but this movie had drew barrymore and i just think she is the cutest thing i dont know what it is about her but i just smile the whole time i am watch her she just captivates me that way i mean i even watched adam sandler just to see her in 50 first dates how sad is that this wasnt the greatest baseball movie it wasnt supposed to be it was a love story about a sad puppy that hung on to the only thing that never let him down until he found something worth giving that up for it had a predictable ending but there was so much on the way there that made it worthwhile,1
the costumes the dialog historical accuracy are terrible for instance stacey dash and the hanging scene the noose was accurate as for as i could tell but that type of noose broke the persons neck ms dash is left hanging at the end of the rope with no ill effects until the rope was shot this type of not did not strangle the person it killed them at the end of the dropbr br and right before they go in to rob a bank in a flashback they pause on the street for a group hug with their bandannas hiding their faces that would have been obvious to people on the streetbr br the poor editing that is a battery pack under that shirt and it is obvious the clip of the long ride shows them riding along then reverses the filmbr br i did like the fact that they kept the scene with the horse taking a crap it seemed symbolic the entire movie was crap,0
the comic strip featured actors from the young ones a student based sitcom from the 80s comic strip features included parodies of westerns the famous 5 and the professionals all a lot funnier than this having said that alexei sayle puts in a good turn as a traffic cop with ambition and the soundtrack features great music from the era 510,0
i have to say that i used to be a huge fan of the series the first 3 were great and the others had their moments but this new beta house is one of the worst movies i have ever seen it is a shame since this was a great series and it just keeps getting worse i know they are made for dvd films but some effort would be nicebr br there are no laughs just a couple of good oneliners that will bring a smile if that there is pretty of nudity and very hot chicks but neither the sexy stuff nor the jokes really workbr br to add to all that this is a racist film too or as racist of a film one can make without asking to be called racist i am not one of those people who think everything should be politically correct but the portrayal of minorities is very offensivebr br i wouldnt waste any time on this garbage see the previous versions they will make you laugh not sick,0
latest attempt to revive the series actually based on a pretty good idea but without the required gore fxviolence for this type of thriller and thus boring good special fx sets costumes etc but the film comes of just plain silly and a nearwaste of time hopefully the next installment will correct this problem,0
two hands is a highly enjoyable aussie crime caper which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines tense dramatic moments with very funny characters and situations to give the film the right balance and feel the comedy of the film occurs naturally and the laughs havent been set up too elaborately havent been too worked at it really is very funny thanks to the fact that each character in the movie is excellently cast and that each actoractress recognises and can relate to the aussie humor they portray it very well and very realistically of course theyre helped out immensely by a fantastic script by writerdirector gregor jordan i was reading another review of this film by an american who had seen it and he heavily criticised it basically passing it off as a pulp fiction clone i think that thats just rubbish this film isnt trying to be pulp fiction the feel and style of each of this excellent films are totally opposite without wanting to sound superior or arrogant i think to fully understand this film the humor the sincerity the characters etcyou have to be australian or at least understand the culture which the other guy obviously didnt have the faintest clue about some americans whose reviews of certain nonamerican films seem ignorant to and have trouble comprehending anything that isnt an american product its a real shame because this is a really great film the love story featured between the main character and the girl is also portrayed in a very real sincere and sweet way im very proud to have this film in my collection 45 out of 5,1
stuey unger was a card playing legend he was quoted in an interview as saying some day i suppose its possible for someone to be a better no limit holdem player than me i doubt it but it could happen but i swear to you i dont see how anyone could ever play gin better than me theres a gin rummy scene in this movie that is so amazing you could have plopped it in xmen as a showcase for a superheros mutant power thats how incredible this man wasbr br i have a few minor problems with this movie as dark as this movie was stueys real life was darker poker pro todd brunson said during the last world series of poker bob stupak mike sexton and i had a drink and talked about stu mike told us how he could barely talk hadnt showered in weeks and how his fingers were burned black by a crack pipe in the film michael imperioli looked far too healthy to be stu unger in the final years of his life when stuey won his last wsop he looked like a skeleton but lets face it this production lacked both the time and the deniro to make that kind of transformation my other problem was that i wish there was more poker playing with actual hands and situations sure it might have bored the average non poker enthusiast but it would have been nice for the hardcores too bad the movie wasnt 6 hours or so longerbr br i watched the movie with 3 non poker players and they all thoroughly enjoyed it just like you dont have to be a former member of the colonial army to enjoy gibsons the patriot you dont have to be a poker player to see this gem cant wait for the dvd 8 out of 10,1
my dad had this movie as an 8mm reel i loved it when he would pull out the projector tape a sheet to the wall and play gerald mcboing boing the thought of a child who communicated through sounds fascinated mebr br nine years ago my son was diagnosised as autistic the doctors would ask me questions about my son such as how does he communicate with you i would respond have you ever seen the cartoon gerald mcboing boing i would love to have a copy of this cartoon to show my son and his educators this is how my son see hes worldbr br recently i spoke with a digital transfer specialist who indicated most personal 8mm films did not contain sound until the mid 1970s i guess i was pretty lucky to have experienced the sights and sounds of gerald mcboing boing in 1972,1
i question anyone saying they dont care for this movie some reviewers have said it didnt have enough action some said it was too long etc dont listen to them if you like shawshank redemption andor braveheart you will definitely love this moviebr br the acting performances are superb tim roth john hurt and jessica lang are allsuperb and liam neeson does an admarible job and is a very imposing character because of his size the cinemaphotography was brilliant and breathtaking it is onw of the few movies i have seen in my life along with shawshank that was virtually flawless from casting directing writing acting etcbr br i was amazed this wasnt in the top 50 or 100 movies reviewed i felt so passionately about it that i just registered with imdb so i could let everyone know the real scoop i have seen this movie about 10 times each time with a different person and everyone has loved it you must be awake and pay attention carefully for the first 30 minutes because they introduce quite a few characters in the beginning if you have the attention span longer than most of these juvenille kids writing reviews for the movies on this site than you will love this movie come onall 3 lord of the rings movies in the top 9 and the matrix at 32 that should show you the age range of most reviewers herebr br this is a top 50 movie,1
the book while not particularly great was decent but this movie completely changes it a lot of the elements of the story are consistent between the book and the movie but dr ross character goes from a creatively written character who lives for money and ends up causing the volcanic eruption with her greed to a heartonhersleeve damsel in distress who wont do anything if she even catches the slightest hint that it might be less than noble when movies change the book that much but keep the same name it should be a crime,0
i am actually outraged at the comment i read stating that this movie was boring and the beautiful scenery was marred by the black and white footage it was made in 1925 i think it absolutely incredible for its time br br the journey that these people had to go through is utterly remarkable it took them a week just to cross a river the women carried their children in heavy wooden cradles on their backs climbing up a solid sheet of rock sometimes barefoot in the snow i would like to see anybody do that now br br i thought it was a wonderful film with some truly amazing shots and an incredible story,1
ok i really dont have too much to say about this film other than this i have seen over 4000 films in my life and more than 2300 of those were horror films while i have some difficulty deciding which is the best as opposed to my favourite which i can tell you is george a romeros dawn of the dead i can tell you without the slightest hesitation that todd sheets zombie bloodbath is the absolute worst horror film i have ever seenbr br there is simply nothing positive i can say about this film the acting the dialogue the directing the makeup the music every aspect of this film is simply so far below what is acceptable that it boggles my mind that this was ever even releasedbr br even if you are a horror or zombie movie completist please heed my warning and do not waste your time on this garbage there is no pleasure to be gotten from viewing this you wont even get any laughs out of the utter ineptitude on display trust me please,0
being a science fiction fan from my early childhood long time since i always hated implausible plots its a pity that most authors of science fiction stories for children do not show this kind of respect for their audience i always suspected them of thinking children are to dumb to realise so we dont have to strive the writer of science fiction 2002 is no exception the story is about a boy who is instigated by his new friends to spy after his parents because they think that the parents are aliens as intriguing the idea sounded to me as much was i bored by its realisation it seemed to me that the filmmakers had exactly this one idea and tried to stretch it over the ninety minutes by dunking it into a dark stylish and painstakingly slow atmosphere the only thing that kept me in my seat was the question how do they manage to get out of this implausible rubbish and then bang they did not even try so if you are looking for good entertainment for both children and parents go and watch klatretøsen 2002 instead,0
this movie was extremely poorly conceived from every angle except technological i stood and watched everyone waddle out of the theater their faces drained like their lives flashed before their eyes eyes wandering at their neighbor wondering if it was just them i mean how could the movie really be bad nobodyll admit it its a classic case of the emperor wears no clothes who am i to question a movie containing a guy who stops a jet liner but the fact remains every member of the audience is thinking what im writing right now i actually plagiarized their facesbr br obviously lois is only aroused by power she wont even have a cup of coffee with the superman with glasses who doesnt stop jet liners it cant be the look in his eyes to the depths of his soul or anything like that in the old supermans she had some level of connection with him he wasnt priority number 1 obviously but it strengthened her character that she was torn i bet henry kissinger would have even won this lois over before clark kentbr br and now its official kryptonite does to superman what eating at mcdonalds does to the avg personbr br superman one he loses his earth dad then finds his real super dad the story is captivating every step of the way hes human he relates to people and he feels love for people he relates to highschool students he relates to people who feel different he relates the superman returns superman seems to relate only to superpeople and it seems hes just doing a job when hes saving peoplebr br theres something about clark that lois likes shes really internally in love with him but cant admit it and when he comes into the picture as superman it throws a kink in the ontherocks love without superman she wouldve fallen in love with clark at least thats what the movie points to whether it was the intention or not superman returns is a love story between a woman and superman clark is like a pile of horse maneur to lois literallybr br superman two i just watched it again as a kid i thought i enjoyed the action but now i know it was the story that held me then too watching it over and over again if i saw superman returns as a child i wouldve hated it then too i thinkbr br there is so much heart and soul and superpower going around in this movie its sick superman gives up his powers for love as a world plot is going on and meanwhile meanwhile lex luthers got something fantastic up his sleevebr br superman three now theres a threeway love story between superman and lana and clark only humanity wins and clarks inner nature beats supermans power because when his supermoral nature is gone and hes superhuman who does human things with his superpowers she sees its not the power of superman that shes in love with its not superpowerman but supermortalman that she,0
i bought dark angel seasons 1 2 two weeks ago after catching a couple of season 1 episodes on channel 5 nothing prepared me for how brilliant the show is i havent enjoyed anything as much since firefly also and amazing show ill admit season 2 wqasnt quite as good but there are still some amazing episodes see designate this bag em the berrisford agenda harbor lights freak nation etc and alec is great ive heard some of the plans for the wouldbe season 3 and i have to say i cant believe it was cancelled i wont spoil it for you but it would have rocked i also think it has a lot of potential as a movie although at the moment it seems highly unlikely as proof of my obsessiveness maxs barcode number is 332960073452 and in the two weeks ive had it i am 3 episodes away from having watched both seasons twice its just too good,1
its hard to tell if this hambrained bmovie adventure is a spoof a homage or just plain bungled but it doesnt work whichever way you look at it based on michael crichtons soso novel its a nutty mixture of lost cities giant hippos monster monkeys naff visual effects and corny dialogue the first thing that scuppers this tosh is the gorilla that can communicate in sign language and needless to say the film doesnt get any better from that point on making all this old rope somewhat worthwhile are tim curry turning in a feverish slice of ham and sporting a bizarre accent that defies identification and ernie hudson who also seems to know that this is all a load of old rubbish,0
well i suppose the good news concerning william wincklers 2001 opus the doubled avenger is that it manages to unite three of russ meyers mammarian marvelskitten natividad haji and raven de la croixin one picture i can only assume that lorna maitland tura satana and babette bardot were busy the week they shot this thingor else managed to see a copy of the script in advance the bad news though and theres plenty of it is that this filmif it can even be called that having been shot straight to videois a complete misfire a total abortion an outandout atrocity an absolute abomination and truly one of the worst pictures that i have ever seen look no further for the lamest superhero movie ever made the plot here such as it is deals with kitten gaining superpowers after fellating the rare cockazilla plant in south america to cure her breast cancer oy and later battling a trio of megalunged bikini dancers back in la too bad that every lame boob joke trotted out falls completely you should pardon the expression flat that there is zero actual nudity in the film at all other than some old photos of kitten in her heyday and that some shaving cream and a papiermache boulder are the sum total of the special fx the meyer gals here are a bit long in the toothsaggy in the chest to put it kindly although sheri dawn thomas as bikini girl ooga boobies does manage to uh stand out nicely so why have i given this juvenile unfunny failed embarrassment of a movie 2 stars instead of 1 to be succinct joe bob briggs his voiceover commentary in the special features of the dvd i just watched is absolutely hilarious especially when he pulls out around 100 synonyms for the word breast from the 1000 on his web sites canonical hooters list the man is a national treasure and he manages to upgrade this skeet of a disc to coaster status,0
may contain spoilers a few weeks after i had originally wrote my review for hood of the living dead i realized that i may have been a bit too harsh on this movie which is why i decided i would do something i had never done before review the same movie again dont get me wrong i still dont like the movie i still think its dreck and i still think the zombies dont look all that zombieish the story in the movie is still in my opinion weak and rather lame the story is about a guy named rick who works as a scientist that just happens to be working on a serum thing that heals sick cells in animals and his brother germaine the two arent exactly on the best of terms my my an original plot point and argue a lot one day germaine is shot in a driveby shooting and rick calls up his scientist buddy to bring the serum to try to resuscitate germainewhereas most people wouldve called 911 but whatever naturally the serum fails and germaine dies if that didnt happen thered have been no movie after the police and the coroner until the end of time i will still think that maybe the paramedics shouldve shown up leave the scene shows the coroner van which i still believe was just someones van with a coroner decal thrown on the side and germaine returning to life to attack and kill the paramedics i would talk more about the plot but i feel that if i reveal more about the story you wouldnt want to watch it and we wouldnt want that now would we but suffice to say that the story in my opinion at least meanders and is rather slow moving pun not intended as ive previously said in my review the zombies dont look all that much like zombies i still think they look like theyve been in a bar fight thats not to say that they should all be decaying and whatnot but still there should at least be bite marks on the victims also i still dont like the fact that the directors continually switch up the pace at which the zombies move they couldnt really seem to decide on whether or not to have the zombies run or shamble as most zombie movies do dont get me wrong im all for running zombies but make up your minds people in one scene the zombie runs toward the living and in the other he just shambles to them and sometimes they just dont seem believable yes i know their fictitious creatures but still i am of course referring to the zombie that runs his hand on the wall as though he were walking through a dark living room and i still dont like the zombie who is lying on the ground gets shot then jerks like he was just shot the sound in the movie also bothered me mainly the music which while it may have just been my copy of the,0
slaughter high is perhaps the most underrated slasher flick of the 1980s it is one of the few films in the genre that is enthralling throughout that being said it also relies heavily on the standard slasher formula a group of young men and women get killed one by one gruesomely until the final showdownbr br the reason why slaughter high stands above most movies in its genre is that it goes more overthetop marty the killer has good reason to hold a grudge against his former classmates they electrocuted him as he stood naked in a girls locker room shower jabbed at his crotch with a javelin and to top it off rigged his science lab experiment so it could disfigure himbr br so the victims in this movie are about as unlikeable as you get when they reunite years later at a high school reunion put on by marty himself you realize they havent matured all that much theyre a bunch of sociopathsbr br it is mindboggling why they would not wonder why they were the only ones to show up to the reunion which by the way is held at a school that has since fell into disrepair and who would think its a good idea to drink beer and liquor found in the abandoned building in a room that happens to have their old lockers as well as martys on display there are many leaps of faith the viewer needs to take to enjoy this film the ending makes little or no sense and the screenwriters have a strange understanding of how april fools day works the movie claims that pranks are no longer allowed after noonbr br in all the movie is one of the best examples of the slasher genre despite all of its flaws it is hard to understand why it hasnt yet found its way to dvd when so many other runofthemill slasher flicks are graced with special editions,1
valley girl is the definitive 1980s movie with catch phrases filtered throughout this wonderfully acted movie the characters are so convincing that you forget it is a movie and not a video of an actual dayinthelife of any high school usa this flick is to the 1980s what the brady bunch tv series is to the 1970s if you dont like it well then gag me with a spoon,1

deepa mehtas fire is groundbreaking bold and artistic a masterful social commentary on the plight of the women from conservative upper middle class indian households this is a film no one should miss shabana azmi and nandita das give stellar performances by underplaying their characters as much as possible ar rahmans music is the work of the genius and almost plays the role of another character in the film mehta uses rahmans score and together they create such amazing sound montages that effectively portray the views of the world around radha and sita whenever they look to each other for support this film is not about lesbianism as many have branded it lesbianism is just a part of the film it is unfortunate that most people tend to write the film off calling it taboo instead of giving it a chance and looking at its real meaning,1
they all laughed is a superb peter bogdanovich that is finally getting the recognition it deserves and why their are many reasons the fact that its set in new york which truly sets the tone the fantastic soundtrack the appealing star turns from ben gazzara and the late john ritter who is superb and of course no classic is complete without audrey hepburn the film is a light and breezy romantic comedy that is very much in the vein of screwball comedy from the thirties film is essentially about the odyssey detective agency which is run by gazzara who with his fellow detectives pot smoking and roller skating eccentric blaine novakthe films coproducer and john ritter basically the gazzara falls for a rich tycoon magnates wifehepburn and ritter falls for beautiful dorothy stratten who sadly murdered infamously after production they all laughed is essential viewing for bogdanovich fans,1
this was the very first movie i ever saw in the theatre by myself i was 7 years old and to this day it is one of my favorite movies its pure smarmy cheese the cartoon was marketed towards young girls selling dolls with soft bodies and big plastic heads one for every colour of the rainbow with their own special animals sprites and even a talking rainbow horse typical of the time period each show was about how hope togetherness and magic can make everything all betterbr br the movie concerns the coming of spring when all the light and colour returns to the world but this time it just isnt happening for our lovely hero a spoiled princess plots to overtake the soul lightgiver and implied life giverof the universe which happens to be a giant diamond for her own devious purposes with no regard for reality and now rainbow and her newly found friends orin onyx and chris must save the universe as i said before its cheesy but its cute and its exactly like all of the other cartoons from that time period like the carebear movies strawberry shortcake rose petal and the smurfs all movies created to sell dolls to kids and it works,1

really its a dreadful cheat of a film its 70minute running time is very well padded with stock footage the rest are non descript exteriors and drab interiors scenes the plot exposition is very poorly rendered they are all just perfunctory scenes sort of strung together there is no attempt at drama in scene selection but rather drama is communicated by the intensity of the actors please dont askbr br the plot concerns a rocket radiating a million degree heat orbiting earth five miles up threatening to destroy the earth its a real time menace that must be diverted if a custom built hbomb can be fashioned and placed in an experimental rocket within an hour nothing very much here to report except for a mad speech by a scientist against the project because there might be some sort of life aboard and think of the scientific possibilities but this speech made by the obligatory idiot liberal was pretty much passé by thenbr br what saves this film somewhat uniquely is the stock footage ive never seen a larger selection of fifties jet fighter aircraft in any other film this is by no means a complete list but just some of the aircraft i managed to see theres a brief interception by a pilot flying in alternate shots an f89 scorpion and an f86 first to scramble interceptors is the royal canadian air force in hawker hunters and f86 sabre jets or canadian built cf13s and even a pair of cf100 clunksbr br then for some reason there are b52s b47s and even b36s are seen taking off more paddingbr br these canadian jets are moving at 1200 miles an hour i dont think so since one of them appears to be a ww2 era gloster meteor the rest f80s the meteors press the attack and one turns into a late f84f with a flight of early straight wing f84s attacking in formationbr br theres a strange tandem cockpit version of the f80 that doesnt seem to be the t33 training type but some sort of interim allweather interceptor variant with radar in the nose these are scrambled in a snowstormbr br an angled deck aircraft carrier is seen from about 500 meters it launches f8u crusaders f11f tigers a5 vigilantes and a3 skywarriors the air force scrambles f86s and f84s and more f89s then youve ever seen in your life as well as f100 super sabres and f102 delta daggersbr br the f100s press their attack with sooooo much padding the f89s unload their rockets in their wingtip pods in slo mo the f86s fire an f102 lets loose a falcon even some f80s f94s with midwing rocket pods let loose there is a very strange shot of a late model f84 prototype with a straight wing early model f85 above it in a turn obviously a manufacturers republic aviation advertising film showing the differences between the old and the new improved models of the f84 thunderjet how it strayed into here is anybodies guessbr br there is other great stock,0
the worlds largest inside joke the worlds largest most exclusive inside jokebr br emulating the brash and everyman humor of office space this film drives the appeal of this film into the ground by making the humor such that it would only be properly appreciated by legal secretaries writing books the audience is asked to assume the unfamiliar role of a legal secretary and then empathize with the excruciatingly dumb protagonistbr br the entire film is centered on the legal secretary finding free time listening to music and writing a novel while working these are his goals you cant imagine the slap in the face it is to the audience when around halfway through they find out he has had a job which fit all three of those criteria but then gives it up the director and screenwriter jacob kornbluth and josh kornbluth completely remove the audiences motivation to empathize or even find entertaining a protagonist that has previously thrown away that which he is complaining about the lack thereofbr br apart from that major stumbling block the legal secretary insider humor fails because they must be explained explicitly to the audience each time they happen without these asides the audience wouldnt have noticed anything particularly strange humor is only effective if it doesnt need to be thoroughly explained to the audience what is funny,0
the headline describes it exactly this dribble of a film was nothing more than the typical group of teens killed someone accidentally now that someone is hauntingkilling them off 20 years later crap that has been shoved down our throats for decades the only twist is instead of an angry exclassmate or lovable psycholoser it was a nun nun wants to eliminate the sin from the girls blah blah girls accidentallypurposely drown the nun blah blah nun haunts the girls people die movie ends the only thing that made this watchable were the death scenes which were pretty cool especially the one with the elevator door ripping off this fat ladys arms but even they couldnt make this a great movie brian yuzna should hang his head for attaching himself to this refuse im sure glad i rented it and didnt buy it or id be furious beyond belief if you want a nunsploitation flick to please the senses go watch demonia or something stay away from this garbage,0

i read all the reviews here after watching this piece of cinematic garbage and it took me at least 2 pages to find out that somebody else didnt think that this appallingly unfunny montage wasnt the acme of humour in the 70s or indeed in any other era if this isnt the least funny set of sketch comedy ive ever seen itll do till it comes along half of the skits had already been done and infinitely better by acts such as monty python and woody allen if i was to say that a nice piece of animation that lasts about 90 seconds is the highlight of this film it would still not get close to summing up just how mindless and drivelridden this waste of 75 minutes is seminal comedy only in the world where seminal really does mean semen scatological humour only in a world where scat is actually feces precursor jokes only if by that we mean that this is a handbook of how not to do comedy tits and bums and the odd beaver niceif you are a pubescent boy with at least one hand free and havent found out that playboy exists give it a break because it was the early 70s no way there had been sketch comedy going back at least ten years prior the only way i could even forgive this film even being made is if it was at gunpoint retro hardly sketches about clowns subtly perverting children may be cutting edge in some circles and it could actually have been funny but it just comes off as really quite sad what kept me going throughout the entire 75 minutes sheer belief that they may have saved a genuinely funny skit for the end i gave the film a 1 because there was no lower scoreand i can only recommend it to insomniacs or coma patientsor perhaps people suffering from lockjawtheir jaws would finally drop open in disbelief,0
well maybe im just having a bad run with hindi movies lately i asked the video store guy for apharan prakash jha but being a new release wasnt available yet so i had to settle for this one it turned out to be the stupidest hindi movie ive seen and ive seen quite a few no wonder bollywood is the laughing stock of the whole world if imdb had negative ratings i would give garam masala a 10br br i remember seeing a tv show about the jazzy premiere they had for its release in mumbai all the usual celebs and their sideys showed up for some strange reason people expect good stuff from piyadarashan i did not like hulchul hungama or his other films hulchul probably dubbed from tamil or telugu came across as very loud inyourface fare that again didnt make much sense except in a bollywood flick this latest piece of utter cxxp proved that this guy has no brains who made him a director even a bollywood director at that br br anyhow to the film now what starts off as a romantic escapade turns into a nonsensical womanhunt two fashion photographers working for a magazine share an apartment isnt it similar to no entry where the 2 dudes work for a gossip magazine and share an office jezuz christ now theyre copying their own stories well anyways theres some cook or chef that tries to help one of the dodos in his quest for multilateral love aka multitasking multitiming what happened in the end ive no idea i switched off midway what ridiculous junk i cant believe they even released it and how sadistic to wallow in their own filth for which audience did they make it the poor illiterate indian masses 700 mil at last count or the wellheeled nri desis staying in phoren either ways it doesnt matter neither group has any clue what makes a good movie and probably deserves such godawful stuffbr br its a short review because theres nothing to write about but the usual bag of fgrade garbage bollywood should change its name to follywood and yes this review is much better than the movie itself,0
if you like scifi monsters and ancient legends then you will love this movie br br the special effects are by far the best i have seen since juarassic park hit the big screen years ago while the acting may have been a little less than desirable the story line and effects adequately compensated for itbr br i wish now i had seen this at the movies on a theater screen instead of our 42 inch big screen tvbr br if you like nonstop action awesome visuals and taste for myth and loreyou have to see this movie,1
i had some time to kill before watching football so i saw this movie being offered on the scifi channel and it literally after watching it i thought i had encountered my version of mentally walking the bataan death march as my conscious was beaten into submission by the awful movie which ripped off the mummy series and jurassic park it was so bad that i thought the opening credits were the highlight of the movie and then it went into such a abysmal descent that it made the recent drop in the stock market seem like a hiccup the acting was so bad that i was hoping that one and all would be buried at the end the lead by casper van dien made me long for the high caliber acting of steven seagal in on deadly ground as his line reading was so wooden that woody woodpecker was thinking of making a cameo to sit on his shoulder i also noticed that his emotional range is so limited that i was under the impression my kitten was more expressive when asking for popcorn to eat the direction was so abysmal i looked back yearning to my nephews grade 3 play recital which had more pace and better vision and the fact that this movie seems to be have spliced together from afterthoughts of the aforementioned movie franchise it can not even be thought of as a homage the fx of the movie was so bad that i thought the director and producers were enviormentally friendly by recycling cheap special effects from grade z horror flicks from yesteryear what robert wagner tom bosley and geoffrey lewis were doing in this movies is beyond me and they should look at litigation against their agents for misrepresentation for getting them involved with such a dreck of a movie my warning to one and all is watch this movie at your peril as this movie may cause your iq to diminish with prolonged viewing on a side note i noticed at imdb that sometimes salaries for movies are published i was wondering if their is a way that actors that should give the salaries back for their poor performances in such movies beware and be safe avoid at all costs,0
am i the only one who thought the point of this film was the graphic violence i knew nothing about leigh scott when i rented it and would not have done so if i had known that most of his previous films were horror films i am not into that at all i was just expecting an informative docudrama of the 911 reportbr br instead i got an almost incomprehensible violent movie the only good thing about it for me was that it made me want to read the report to figure out what the heck this movie was aboutbr br i wrote this because i am shocked that we have become so immune to violence in films and on tv that it was not even worth commenting on by the bloggers whose reviews that i read,0
this was a personal favorite of mine when i was young it had everything that was great with 90s kids movies lovable dinosaurs cute kids an eccentric villain and a few great songs and not the typical little mermaidbeauty and the beast type songs but ones that are atually entertaining i ran into this movie again recently and i still love it as much as ever i recommend that everyone of every age should see this movie and i definitely think that it should be introduced to the younger generations sorry not the most informative im in kinda a rush just please trust me all who go against this movie are killing their inner child,1

by 1955 five years after this one was released james stewart and anthony mann had completed another six films together four of them westerns their rapport was obvious from the outset and what was intended as little more than a universal progrmmer became both a cult and a classic buffs of the period will revel in the fact that the first ten names on the credits were all more than well known and thats not counting ray teal or anthony curtis later to become tony perhaps ten years later the psychological western was well entrenched but in 1950 it was rare to throw ahab into the mix with cain and abel to say nothing of addressing several other issues along the way and still furnish a conventional western on the surface and full credit to all concerned one to add to the dvd collection,1
the first 10 minutes of the movie makes fun of sequels and pg13 movies these are the 2 reasons the movie is so bad they constantly reference a movie called get leo which is the movieinamovie version of get shorty every time they do this you will be really angry travolta isnt very cool neither is keitel however the rock and vince vaughn are hilarious they arent the kind of funny you would expect to see in an elmore leonard movie though if you havent seen get shorty you will probably like be cool if you liked get shorty you will leave the theater wanting to kill the director and screenwriter wait for the dvd,0
