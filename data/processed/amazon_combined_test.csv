i received these today to only return them the size was not as petite as i would have liked they are beautiful and came quickly but they take up my entire ear lobe,1
great for the price point top of the boot is more floppy than appears in the photo this is okay with me but i thought worth noting tread is good and they are very lightweight very warm as advertised and so far water proof i paid double for a totes zipper slip on and they only lasted a season i anticipate these will be more resilient,1
swimsuit is cute but missing a strap,0
these are great boots but with a major flaw the footbed and support in these boots are awesome the support from ariat not so much three of the bootlace hooks pulled out of the leather within 4 months that is completely unacceptable in a 200 pair of boots these are my first and last pair of ariat laceups,0
stitching came apart after two uses do not recomend,1
great if you b cup or smaller but i have fs and a large should accommodate a larger chest,0
shoes do not stretch so i could not get my foot in not worth the price shoes are mesh with absolutely no flexibility in the material plus not wide width at all made for someone with narrow feet,0
you get what you pay for so cheap looking and manufactured took forever to arrive luckily it was inexpensive would cost to much to send it back into the garbage for this one also wont be using this dealer again,0
the material is a bit thin see through when fully stretched out if you have larger muscular legs,2
i specifically ordered this product because it offered a silver and a gold however i only received 2 gold and its already turned to my neck green extremely disappointed,0
cutebr warmbr easy to put onbr grandson likes them,2
this is not leather the insides are wearing apart and ive only had it a week,0
great undershirt for work i have a few packs of these soft enough not to itch but stands up to wearing a vest it does have a lower neck to not choke you out,2
pretty design comfortable fit wore them all day at work,2
i loved this shirt when i got it i ordered in both black and maroon the fit is perfect whether the back is buttoned or not very flattering the reason for the one star is that the material is very cheap both tops i only wore once with the back buttoned and the buttons came off of them the shirt fits perfect so it wasnt a matter of the shirt bit fitting correctly i believe theyre just poorlycheaply made very disappointing,0
not for everyday wear it falls apart but classy looking,1
the first few times wearing them they were fine fit nice comfy but after about 34 washes they starteed pilling and the seam on the side popped open these were not tight in this area by the knee where there is extra fabric for bending and bunching up so i have no idea why it just burst open over all not really worth it for me,1
feels and looks cheap,1
theres a hole in the ear and its barely hanging on the headband the ears also stand up awkwardly and it makes it look bad on your head,0
when i received it the suit was worth 5 stars but the shirt has utterly collapsed in only one summer the front still fits but the back is a huge bag very disappointed,1
style and comfort wise these slippers are great but the soles which appear to be rubber but obviously arent absorb moisture so if you wear them on a wet floor or deck you might soon feel the water seeping through to your feet its like wearing sponges the obvious ramifications of this for mildew and fungus developing prevent me from recommending them,0
easy to use bought 2 of them awesome,2
this really small i will have to have it stretched out just a bit,1
too stretchy and no support,1
there decent leggings,1
very nice robe gave it to my mom as a christmas gift the armpit did develop a hole it fits her good with some room so it isnt due to lack of a good fit so i had to sew that already othrrwise she really likes it and its soft,2
looks pretty but the bar was not curved ill have to try to bend it but i didnt have high expectations for 3,0
one size does not fit all thats just another way of saying we make just one size they slip down below my heals they come up just above my ankles which almost justifies the description of women above ankle not any higher as the photo shows im pulling up on them a lot because these are the colors i want ill keep them and deal with the slipping my pants cover the lack of height because i had hoped to have the ones in the photo i am disappointed buyer be aware,1
my daughter loves to play with it i had gotten it for myself for a gothic wedding but chose to go another route well packaged arrived on time and is cutebr not as long as i assumed it would be and the clip came on glued on the 1st time trying it on,1
way too big even with trying to fit this correctly to my face it goes into the bottom of my eyes and leaves a huge gap open under my chin gonna return these cute designs though,0
was a favorite top till i washed it does not wash well gets worn look and pills all over it,1
my granddaughter is three years old i really like the socks except one pair the brown fox is about 2 sizes too small they look like theyd fit a one year old she obviously cant wear them thats a wasted pair,1
i absolutly love wearing this necklace with my royal blue tunic top and vest it looks amazing,2
so these arent bad they fit fine i got an xl which is my normal size but they are not high waisted which is a bummer and the pocket is super thick and is really uncomfortable because its so bulky but other than that they are nice,1
beautiful umbrella,2
the product was defective after one week of use,0
this is cute the material is soft and flattering but go down a size it runs super huge,1
it looks good buy not for a woman,1
false advertising,0
this was a gift,2
its most likely a very warm hat tho very small circumference and depth of hat,0
well they are soft and comfortable but i am sad to report they are see through this is an issue with so many leggings i read the qa and everyone said they we not they are if you bend over at all or if you have semi thick thighs or a butt im 5ft 2in and 125 and these are tighter on my thighs and butt therfore in these areas they are see through i checked in the mirror as soon as i tried them on you can see thong and alll i wouldnt wear these leggings unless it was with a long shirt or a dress of some sort bummed but they were cheap the search continues,1
shoes fits great my son loves it,2
fits as expectedbr hasnt lost any color with washingbr no shrinkagebr and my son loves it,2
i paid almost 4700 for these boots i was going to return them but my daugther age 4 saw them and feel in love she has worn them 5 times five 1st day she wears them to preschool they come home looking like this i know for a fact the kids didnt go outside for play she isnt a wild crazy kick up her heels kind of kid i gave them 2 star only because she loves them it is sad for the cost they dont hold up better,0
perfect look for the costume the only drawback was that the zipper was near impossible to use,1
this bracelet was perfect for the little girl whom i bought it for it was a little bit on her at 8yr old so i just moved the attachment ring and it worked great the detailson the charms are actually pretty good especially considering the price,2
cute but narrow and very tight on the top of foot,1
i havent used them a lot yet but the few times so far they seem to be very helpful,2
too long and rolls up im 6 tall with a long torso size 1618 i purchased the xxl the fit around is good but the body of the shaper is too long and rolls up when i walk and sit i tried pulling my underwear over but the tail of the shaper stuck out the leg holes of my underwear plus the underwear on top just accentuated one of the lines the shaper was purchased to camouflage another thing to note is that the straps are very narrow its hard to tell in the photo exactly what is the shaper and what is the bra on the modelbr note i returned the items and was issued a full and prompt refund,0
from my wife the elastic is a soft elastic so its comfortable i am a 36dd and a size 12 usually this would make me a 34large34 but i wanted something a bit baggy for a cozy summer sleepwear this xl 34fits34 but with the elasticity its huge i could easily fit two of me again the elastic is soft and it fits but i probably could have gotten a similar fit or a slightly better fit from a medium,1
these boxer briefs have no ability to stay up the began to slide down inside my pants the moment i started walking i gave the second star because the fabric was comfortable,0
looks good only in the picture save your money,0
the material is kinda shiny maybe a darker color would look less cheap,1
good quality thin fabric but not cheap looking would wear casual or dressy nice flow,2
i have a question please help me i like these pants its just that i washed them by hand and the waste was fine but the leg area shrunk what is the problem i had to give them away im bummedi have not washed my others because im afraid they too will shrink please help me thank you njb,0
ive had many compliments from my gym friends it is long enough to cover your stomach and sleeves to cover some of that arm flablol the mesh panel is not see through but does allow air to pass through however it came apart after the third wash washed it on cold gentle cycle and never put in the dryer on the third wash all the stitching around the neck came out i tried to darn it but it was too extensive so im not ordering another one,0
this package was crammed into my mail box the flimsy clear wrapping was torn and the scarf was left opened in my mail boxbr the scarf itself is so cheap i will never order from this vendor again,0
poor quality paper,0
good price,2
its very loose i bought this for my daughter but even i wear this it keeps falling off,0
its surprising that this sporran is as nice as it is for the price i paid i have a 1949 military issue sporran of the same design and the quality is 1000x better in every way but this everyday sporran holds it own at a greatly reduced cost its made in pakistan but not bad at all,2
great gifts for crocs its a little big but its the only champagne charm that i have found that i liked,2
excellent practical and quality manufacturing thank you,2
your basic bedroom and around the house slippers at an affordable price im a size 8 12 mens shoe size so i got the mediums they seem to run a bit small as my heel just barely makes it the result is the end of the slipper ends up getting stepped on an flattened not a big deal though,1
thin isnt even worth one star its cheap and tarnished avoid,0
this is absolutely adorable however the 5t dress is a shirt at best i would recommend the 5t for a 2 year old not a 4 year old,0
feel like a rockstar wearing them but they wont last will buy again once these wear out,2
this are very good looking but cheap made pants this is the second pair of pants i ordered first was too big and the threads between the legs were open and now this one fits but after 5 minutes into wearing i realized between the legs were unstitchedbr waste of time and money,0
this product is metal but doesnt give at all so to get it to stay on your face you have to tie it super tight at which point the crystals embedded in the metal will stick into your face and indent your skin which is both painful but also makes your skin look terrible so you dont want to take the mask off get something softer or flexible if you plan to wear these for more than 10 minutes or use them as wall decor,0
the first one i purchased broke before it could be worn it was exactly what i needed for my costumejust wish the halo was a little more sturdy,1
loved the dress but an obvious discoloration right in the front so i returned it for another one second dress arrived quickly but also had a slight discoloration in about the same place but since it was less obvious i decided to keep it its a pretty great dress soft comfy flattering im not sure of the colorfastness so ill definitely be washing it in cold water,2
loved it but one side broke too fast not for everyday wear which is a shame because it looks awesomei might give it a second chance,1
way to small,1
this is a small pouch measuring 5x8 not the tote i though i was buying that was described as 15x11 so buyer beware that being said pouch is adorable,1
this outfit looks exactly as pictured and fits as expected,2
so comfortable and fluffy does run slightly large if you want it loose order normal i sized down for a less baggy look,2
to big,0
cute shirt but cut tight i would recommend buying 1size bigger than your normal size,1
love,2
lovely cashmere blend sweater im 51 and weigh 135lbs im 34ddd with a 28 waist wasnt long didnt need any alterations,2
too tight for me nice looking shoe i will have to purchase shoes in a shoe store from now on or repurchase known items,1
i did not notice the description said fit comfort flex waist jeans i can live with the flex waist but the jean material appears to also flex the material is also very thin i would not call these pants jeans i feel like i am wearing maternity pants not goodbr the jeans feel very cheaply made i would not purchase again,1
was a gift,1
came in damaged and in piecesbr very poor quality,0
buyer bewarethis product is made with inferior material they are a knock off of the alvaq product i bought one top through alvaq directly an its a much nicer material and fits perfect i absolutely loved it i thought i would buy one in every color so went back on amazon and thought i was buying the alvaq product and purchased 4 or 5 more tops when they arrived i realized i had been bamboozled they are all made of that cheap polyester instead of a polyspandex blend when i asked them for a refund they told me i could ship them back but they will keep 20 to refund plus i pay for shipping back to china thats crap they are using the alvaq name to sell this crap even though it says alvaq do not purchase any of these tops through anyone but alvaq they are nothing but cheap knock offs wish i would have known this before,0
these shoes are punching way above their weight class they are essentially cheap footwear but they compare to shoes costing at least double the price i paid for them 51 i do see a couple of places where the stitch lines are wavy but nothing that compromises integrity or longevitybr br im not sure id call them boots they are more like a heavy duty reinforced sneaker and thats a good thing as far as i am concerned the sole is heavy duty the insoles were good i still replaced them with gel after a week or so but only because nothing is better than a thick gel insole havent had the chance to test their water resistance but i can say for sure that in deep silty dirt and rocks they are well up to the task in fact i expected them to be trashed visually but i was able to take a wet cloth towel and a brush and bring them back to almostnew appearance the metal eyelets are a nice touch so far no premature wear or problemsbr br update well its been just under two months since i purchased these lightweight boots after wearing them perhaps a dozen times mostly to outdoor firing ranges where you are walking on dry but open ground dirt road consistency the material behind the two bottommost eyelets developed a tear that is about 1 inch long on one shoe it happened when i was lacing up the boots for a morning out and this is down in the toe area where not a lot of strain is being put on the eyelets so we arent talking some kind of undue strain i was feeling good about the use of metal eyelets to reinforce a high strain area but all that did apparently was provide a solid anchor point so something else could tear instead the rest of the shoe looks almost new they were holding up great until they didnt now while i can still wear them i can see the end is near reducing to one star from five since a heavy duty shoe is not up to its core intended purpose,0
the top is not sewn properly and looks as if it was made with scraps of fabric or not cut right,0
looks like barbie hair also the head size is too small,0
the package was so torn and filthy when it arrived with multiple store stickers that i returned the product no way was i going to try on clothing that was so dirty so i am unable to answer how the fit was,0
first time wearing the skirt which fit perfectly the rubber in the waistband detached in two places contacted seller via amazon and nothing back as of yet and its been almost 2 weeks,0
this will not fit you like the picture unless you are 12 skip this,0
when i received the bag had a bad smellbr once aired out for a bit was betterbr after using it for a few months the loop and backpack straps r lose i had to stop using itbr straps r thick so i cant sew by handbr other then that i like it,1
i think these run large i felt i was swimming and that they looked like parachute pants on me i admit i have a hard time with scrub bottoms extra smalls tend to fit a bit too snug in some brands while size small is just way too baggy for my liking also didnt really care for the way these felt i was hoping for a softer feel the way polyester is made these days sometimes can have a nice brushed soft feel especially if higher quality and a little more expensive as these were about 40 these just felt slightly thin cheap regularold polyester sending these back just not the joggers i was hoping for so wont even try to size down,1
the tag says there is 20 cotton in the blend but it doesnt feel like it thin itchy material that i dont expect to last through too many washings,0
i wasnt expecting the quality or look to be as pictured but this skirt is a must have in your closet super comfortable waist and somewhat stretch fabric makes this a perfect fall staple,2
great looking bracelet heavy and substantial with a brushed finish but i am not happy with the screws that hold the links together after less than two months of use one of the screws worked its way loose and the watch dropped off my wrist i was able to catch the watch before it hit the ground but this should not happen i have had other bracelets held together with friction collars and pins or with spring pins and have never had a problem with them the screws seem inferior i reattached the bracelet and applied some thread locker well see if that holds,1
color is great it is a bit rough on the skin to carry,1
does it job,2
in an attempt to replace dickies socks bought long ago and worn out we purchased these my husband wore out a pair in one wearing we had just passed the return window these socks get an f in durability,0
when i read stretchy i was thinking more like leggings or jeggings im 56 about 200 lbs and a size 12 or 14 depending on brand i got a large while i can wear these pants they are tight and the seams are already tearing so if youre around my size i would suggest buying something else i bought these because i needed something quick and cheap for work so they did the job but when i have time i will go out to buy something better,1
works like a charm and really cuts down on the snoring it does transfer the snoring to the nostrals but breath right strips help in that area,2
romantic numbers and keeps time perfectly,2
sizes are wrong i ordered 3xl and im a l the blue pair fits but i had to give away the black pair to a smaller friend because it is way too small,0
daughter loves this dress,2
bought the wallet in april and the strap broke by july the stitching came out completely i was careful not to overfill the wallet with coins or my phone i do like the wallet because you can fit a passport in it easily just wish the wrist strap didnt break,0
this hat is very attractive and fits perfectly it has gotten lots of compliments,2
cheap material more lounge wear than pictured thin material seems like it will fade quickly,1
nice pajamas for your toddler when you want to keep his feet covered,2
this hat came smelling absolutely terrible almost like really bad fish food i have washed it four times and doused it with febreze i think we finally have the smell gone but as expected it did shrink a little bit with the washing it does fit my daughters head but she has a smaller than normal head and i dont think it would fit her if she didnt run on the smaller side i probably should have just returned it but she really loves the look of it i think itll work great now but buy another brand or you will find yourself throwing it in the laundry multiple times because of the smell i included a pic so you could see how it looks after multiple washes not quite crisp like a new hat but it will work,0
this fabric was very cheap and not made well i wouldnt purchase again,0
looks antiquey it is a nice little gift necklace i kept one for myself 0,2
took a long time to receive this product but they are now here and fit perfectly even got a courtesy call from china apologizing for the delay,2
extremely small,0
after receiving the shirt my son didnt really like the design,0
it looks almost exactly like the versa which broke in less than a year i take care of my things so i think the versa was abr cheap piece of garbage i would like to update this when i see if this lasts,1
not the worst i have ordered not the best,1
great fitting sandals second pair and ill keep buying them as long as they make them i would say they fit true to size i have owned the 5060 dollar sandals and like these much better,2
it worked perfect for my 50th birthday party,2
perfect for a hot summer day,2
the earrings look beautiful on the silver mother of pearl are really shiny the wire is super flimsy got all bent up just putting rubber backs on,2
this is perfect storage for watches or sunglasses or all your jewelry its made with quality material and holds together well it would make a wonderful gift for anybody in your life very sturdy and a must have,2
after only 3 maybe 4 times wearing it holes started forming everywhere and it is now too ruined to wear anymore,0
absolutely love this set what a great deal i do wish the crossbody had some interior pockets but other than that it is really awesome item,2
disliked everything i was i would have listened to the other reviews matieral is cheap and crappie i probably could of found a better one at the dollar store 38c fit around my bust line but the cups are to small makes your boobs look deformed also the strap in the front are way loose,0
cute and comfortable but the ash green color was too muddy,1
this romper is adorable the colors are those traditional lilly bright colors the material is high quality and i love that its machine washable the only thing that i dont care for is that it runs incredibly large i bought my normal size and im swimming in it,2
as an ultra runner i experience a lot of pain and swelling on my long training runs after testing these compression socks out on the trail and on the road i havent experienced any more pain or swelling it makes my running much easier and more enjoyable definitely worth the buy,2
i love everything kendra scott glad a friend talked me into this purchase they are surprisingly light weight and just fabulous,2
i use a drop in my sonic jewelry cleaner these bottles will last me for the rest of my life,2
ended up returning it leather was breaking apart and didnt look the best,0
its beautiful but is very sheer,1
too big,1
loved this envelope sack the leather is soft with a cloth lining the inside has two zippers the outside has a long zippered opening and a smaller side zipper it also comes with an attachable wristlet strap and a long gold colored shoulder chain the colors are beautiful and i chose the red rose i wish they had more colors for 1799 this makes a great stocking stuffer gift for friends im using it more or less as a wallet and to hold my smart phone and tablet however the opening zipper does not open all the way so it leaves the opening 1234 too short to insert my tablet still i love it,2
broke within 10minutes of wearing it do not buy,0
runs small and thin not hsppy,0
dont like pvc material,1
ok these are not thermal not fleeceso buy them if ya like the pattern color or construction but dont buy them for warmth period,1
scarf is ok nothing special it does have red white and blue which was what i wanted,1
this shrt was the tightest and smallest size 4 my toddler has ever gotten she liked it after it stretched out on her i recommend purchasing a larger size since they run so snug,1
the person who received these said they were great just what he had wanted,2
its super cute and definitely worth the money,2
i took a chance on a new pair and love them,2
quality material,2
husband says too big doesnt stay up,0
to small and narrow,0
cute dress but it smells horrible very strong chemical smell that does not wash out now that ive washed it several times i cant return it the scent makes it unwearable,0
cute and sturdy i recommend,2
super soft and warm on the inside it keeps my ears warm,2
they will work but i am disappointed in the color they are not vibrant like the photo they are a dull washed out version,1
there is absolutely no way this necklace is 925 sterling silver nor is it plated over the silver i have had it just a few days and my entire neck and chest has broken out in hives because i am allergic to nickel so obviously despite the claims it is in fact nickel its pretty to look at but i will never wear it again still trying to get rid of the hives,0
the fit was nonexistent not flattering and boxy after one wear out was falling apart so much so that i had string tailing behind me at my event,0
dont like the material but they fit better then traditional boxer briefs,1
i really like this shirt it fits perfect and i like the unfinished look,2
im 51134 and this barely reaches my ankles the pattern doesnt match up in places along the bottom its pretty thin and needs a slip underneath,1
i bought this for an art project it is really nice quality and looks really good i will probably order more of them,2
perfect,2
i bought twocheap plastic zippers dont work well and they are really not very classy,0
the product is nice but ran small had to return and request larger one,1
the necklace is cute however seems to be better sized for a child the anchor is literally about 14 inch long and the chain even on the last setting is extremely short and delicate if you are very thin and petite this may be for you if you like a minimalistic style it fits the billi couldnt tell that i had a necklace on when i stood several feet from the mirror,1
i want to love this belt i really do but they dont make it easybr br this is a great belt for those that dont need one if all you need out of a belt is something to hold your leatherman holster youll be happy if you actually expect it to hold your pants up prepare to be disappointed i have to tighten up the belt several times a day and have lost count of the number of times my pants have dropped to my ankles wearing this belt with my hands fullbr br this belt is completely unusable for anyone who actually needs it i still wear it but only as a fashion accessory unless you pair this belt with a set of suspenders to actually hold your pants up prepare to show the world your backside when you least expect it,0
i love this jacket its so soft and warm i sized down and bought a large i usually wear xl it fits nicely the sleeves are a bit too short for my liking the reach my wrist but i personally like when theyre a little longer than that i cant wait to buy more,2
they are big but was expecting that im not one to complain but omg they have this terrible chemical odor i cant get it off ive washed them with dawn and other shampoos it wont go away im going to leave them outside for a bit and see if that works they also had like black smudges on the back when i opened them but they came out when i washed them they added a hair tie with a yellow bow on it it was a nice addition but because of the strong odor on it as well i think it will have to be trashed by all means the shoes are gorgeous but just that smell filled up my house quick and gave me a horrible headache,0
this product wasnt what i expected and material wasnt like the real hanes that you buy in store the boxers were small when i put them on after drying and didnt fit the same i wouldnt buy these again,0
be aware that all the colors are not all the same style fabric some have a soft fleece lining nice and some do not have any lining at all some are hoodies and some are dowel neck and the description is not always accurate for this purchase it describes a cowl neck but it was actually a hoodie the first one i bought in november was a cowl neck with a fleece lining pockets as described and even though it said i should get an xxl it was too big i got an xl it was perfect,0
these are huge,0
unfortunately these simply didnt work for me they did not help with glare just made everything yellow and slightly blurry if anything they made my night vision worse,0
love the bag my mom and i both have that one and we have enjoyed it,2
this is a soft comfortable and amazing robe i love it,2
im 57 145lbs and i ordered a large the fit is very short and wide for me i was hoping it would be long enough for tights but its definitely not doesnt even come close to covering my butt and its too wide for it to even be flattering only reason i gave 2 star instead of 1 is that i ordered quotblackquot and liked the color,0
this was too big i thought that it was a regular shoulder bag,2
dress was way too tight definitely size up once or twice the cape of course was great,0
the chain was cheaply made the globe was nice though overall it wasnt as quality as i was hoping,1
do not order this set i bought it for a trip and just landed and the wheel broke off the large bag so disappointed i would give zero stars but apparently you have to give at least one,0
these are listed as designed for large heads and the lenses are just that they almost look like those novelty oversize joke glasses but your eyes are definitely covered lenses wise they are darker then i prefer but obviously darkness level is personal preference the arms that hold the glasses on your head are just slightly longer the a regular pair i already owned overall for the price and so far what appears to be good quality i would recommend these especially if you have a big head,1
to large,1
item looked nice when it arrived but after 2 uses the zipper broke and the seam ripped after contacting the company they told me that it was past the 30 day return policy it had been about 2 months since i purchased it so it wasnt like i had it for a year very disappointed they would make a product that broke after using it 2 times then not be willing to try to make it right,0
great for my teen and comes with all of the basic colors,2
fits good and good quality,2
this is the slim fit design but it also comes in a standard fit if you prefer there is a link at the bottombr br ive always like seersucker it tends to go inandout of style i guess now its back this shirt is a bit softer than some other seersucker i have it also doesnt have the really deep wells that some seersucker has but if you look closely you can tell that its seersuckerbr br this is a buttondown shirt there is also a pocket on the left side the lines on the pocket as compared to the shirt dont matchup perfectly but its ok made in chinabr br asinb07735944v goodthreads mens standardfit shortsleeve seersucker shirt,2
this is an okay top but it was too short in the torso for me and im only 5434,1
cute but runs a little small would size up 1 size,2
super stretchy maybe too much it gives the finish a fake look otherwise the fit well and feel good,2
originally i gave these five stars because i really liked them but ive only been wearing them for a few days and the paint is starting to chip off they actually make my ears really itchy and smelly which i hate and i dont really feel like they are the exact size they say because they fall right out if they get bumped,0
its beautiful dress i really like the style and color even though it is not as orange as it showed in the picture but the material is so cheap the seam starts to show tear before i put it on i think i am going to return it,0
the bracelet is the same as shown in the picture the color of the bracelet is not towards gold texture instead it is more yellowish the gems are pretty cute but not that shiny i would spare wearing this bracelet in formal gatherings,1
i ordered this product as a gift and was very happy with the color and the tint of the lens,2
wasnt expecting much with these leggings cause of the price point theyre very thin you can see through the black ones when you hold it up to the light but theyll be fine for wearing at home or with a long tunic over them but definitely need to wear matching colored panties with them they are a bit tighter than expected but the waist is okay and doesnt roll down the texture is nice and the cinch in the rear does accentuate the curves,1
thought it was one piece but its two which is fine since now i can mix and match them,2
love the look of the fabric and the color very retro however cant wesr it far too much padding looks awful on,0
very disappointed with this case bought it as a gift for my daughter and paint peeled after 1st week of use my daughter is 14 and only has her phone on her after school for sports so no real wear and tear to wear off the paint,0
will be returning dress way to small i ordered the size i usually wear ive actually lost weight recently and it was still way to small will never buy clothes that are made in china again,0
scratchy material a little odd shaped at the bottom its not horrible but i definitely tucked this away for another try or for a friend lol,1
very small product not for a teenager or adult,0
la tela muy buena freca,2
these were the worst although the material feels good the arent long enough by any means they might be long enough for someone less than 5 ft tall it was a huge disappointment so my search still continues to find a comfortable durable not too hot brand of stockings,0
great product made after shoulder surgery much easier a bit pricy but totally worth it very comfortable run slightly larger than size expected but that is helpful when you cant dress yourself,2
felt very unbalanced on my wrist sent it back,1
seems to be made of good quality but the milkman wording is sooooo off center will return and try order once more but if the problem is corrected ill buy elsewhere,0
the fabric was lower quality than i expected i returned it with no problem,1
the soles of the shoes are like sheets of wood didnt expect them to be as inflexible as they are,0
im not familiar how sizes work for belts as with regular clothes for example buying a pair of pants with a 36 inch waist one would select 36in the actual waste measurement so you need a longer belt to account for the overlap to fasten the buckle,1
too short,0
absolutely adorable my grand daughter loves them,2
my great granddaughter is in live with the crown gloves and wand the dress is just the icing on the cake,2
cheaply made and looks cheap,0
i love paul green but the wrong size was sent i will return them but the are great shoes or would have given a 5,1
if youre looking for an overpriced oversized tissue then by all means get this but if you were looking for a sweater that wont fall apart when the wind blows then definitely dont get this one i will be returning this pos as soon as possible it was not at all worth the price theyre selling it for i wouldnt even pay 5 for it disappointing to say the least,0
the gold is really really bright looks kinda silly other than that these too effectively shade my eyes from the sun,1
super cute bracelets the charms dangle and are fairy detailed it also has adjustable sizes so it should fit an array of ages cute themes and fun colors,2
nice but ordered 2 inches longer than old one wouldnt even fit do not buy,0
it came through a bit more scratched then i would have liked it then when i put it onit was huge on me really would have helped to have measurements listed in the description,1
cute top but was too thin and too snug in the arms area,1
this is not a womens size shirt this is baby size i wear a m bought an xl and this top only comes just below my breast,0
the threat is weak and uneven creating small holes that seem defective,1
very pretty but way too small for my head,1
there is no way this is an extra large this was a small,0
so cute on our little bunny,2
the belt is really cute its a little more flimsy than expected i havent worn it yet but its very pretty,0
its not the nicest of things you can get and i would not recommend this for something as important as your wedding dayits literally a costume accessory and if that is your purpose youll be fine,0
the band is a little heavy gets a little getting used tobr otherwise that is the only problem i have with it,1
its too small i will return it,1
this would be five stars except that the belt slides a bit so it gets loose otherwise perfect 3 compartments are great perfect size not too big not too small great price,1
the arch support in these shoes is incredible which is what i think of when i think of clarks however the tops of the shoes actually hurt my feet after wearing for a while i actually dont think theyre the same clarks i tried on in a storean internet version maybe when i tried these on in the store they were some of the most comfortable shoes ive ever put on however ordered them here because the store didnt have my size and i was leaving on a trip i had them delivered to my location and was very disappointed that i couldnt wear them as i was doing a lot of walking whats even more disappointing is that i didnt see that i had to return them in a monthwho requires that anymore theyve been sitting in a box and i took too long to return apparently didnt realize zappos has their own policy since ive ordered from them through amazon before and have had great success with returnsexchanges check the retun date if you order from zappos,0
true to the other reviews the toe box on this shoe is small otherwise i love the shoe,1
loved it,2
this is really cute for halloween i got the purple tank top dress with black bats and skulls on itbr i bought a small i am 55 and weigh 122 hourglass figure andbr it was a little bit big in the arm holes but doable and a little bit longer than i expected but i am keeping it,2
these shoelaces looked like they should work very well but when my husband started using them they kept coming untied he was very disappointed,1
very cheaply made several broke during first wear,0
perfect comfy shoe,2
i did not like the polyester feel of this material i was hoping itd be made of a stretch cotton spandex like a tshirt i am between sizes m and l i ordered an xl and it was way too big,1
the pins themselves are fine but i rated it down because i got 2 pineapple 1 strawberry instead of one of each i ordered it specifically for the banana so that was a bit disappointing but i gave the extra pineapple to my friend and she was happy with it so overall no big loss i will be ordering a banana elsewhere lol for the price i cant really have any complaints,1
great,2
i like these shoes gotten many complements great summer shoe,2
i am 5 10 220 lb and this was still extremely too small,0
it was very clingy and i cant stand it,0
it doesnt fit snugly and material is the type that kind of stretches out and hangs so she has droop ok texture im hoping with a wash they fit a little better or perhaps i needed to size down,1
while soft they were too short and had no heal it was a straight sock do not recommend,1
wear it for the kitchen arts and crafts gardening cleaning i love it really nice fabric and fits well,2
bonito polo queda muy chico,1
wear them wash them saves on the jeans around the house,2
poor stitching,0
the torso potion of this sweater looks exactly like the picture the material is nice heavy and good quality it is really nice looking and feels great too however the sleeves do not bell out like the picture they are just slightly wider than the cuff at the wrist had i not purchased it purely for the sleeve i would have kept it it is a really nice sweater though if youre cool with the different sleeve ratio,1
looks cute but is kinda thin expected it to be more thick,1
very poorly made,0
so comfortable,2
fits nicely but the skirt flys straight up with even a very light breeze or really any kind of movement at all so you cant wear it without leggings or something underneath it which makes it impractical for super hot summer days and its too liteweight for a fall dress so theres no good time to wear it,1
nicer than the picture can show slightly darker color too super soft and cuddly furry very pleased with this bust is slightly small on me but im very large in that area and a size up would have been too big no closure so no harm done just fyi great quality i love the bobeau brand,2
the threads are all separated and theyre poor quality dont buy,0
this sweater is just okay it isnt fitted the way it looks in the pictures it is a square the pattern looks a little cheap up close but i dont think other people would notice i had to take the sweater in at the waist quite a bit as again its a square sweater i think the models have it pinned in the back so it looks more fitted its a good price though and its very warm i dont think ordering a smaller size would make it look better as it would stretch out the pattern,1
shoes never work even when charged so wish i had tested them before the holiday as now we cannot get a refund very disappointing,0
the quality very poor,0
gift to daughter she likes them,2
sunglasses were great for travel lightweight and great for glare,2
runs about 1 size smaller than listed,2
this bag is the perfect size and weight and has all the pockets however the seams sewn to the zippers ripped before i ever used it still holds everything its been about 3 weeks in use and im a flight attendant so it helps me pack my life away all on my back,0
came just a described and very pretty,2
beyond tiny,0
too narrow i cut a sliver to help expand the width,1
xl at best way to small,0
reviewed by my wife these are just okay they are not as pretty in person as they are in the listing i definitely didnt need two pairs,1
the set is comfortable and soft but runs quite small i ordered 3xl and it was still tight the top measurements are not matching the description the bottom measurements are matching also note the sleeves are a bit on the shorter side but not a big issue lastly the stitching of the bottom running through the middle make it less comfortable that versions with two stitching lines towards the sides vs the middle,1
the source ran out of the red ones so i only got two and a autorefund for red,2
bigger than shown but nice just want smaller as pictured not what i got will work with them,1
do not buy this product did not work and seller wanted to charge me shipping to even return it or only a 50 refund waste of money,0
such a shame that this band snags clothes because it is an otherwise functional nicelooking band i have ruined many pieces of clothing because of this band,0
these jumpsuits are very cheap i bought two and sent them both back theyre made of really thin cotton thats almost see through and which will rip really easily theyre not made to last theyd be cute as a cheap pair of pajamas but theyll get trashed quickly as day wear,1
thin and see through in the pink color although these are soft the neck line stretches out i wouldnt buy again,1
runs small and the fabric is too clingy and lightweight for my taste so glad they offered free returns on this item as its going back,0
the jacket looks cool at first but anyone who owns leather jackets will notice that this is a cheap poorly made jacket ive owned this jacket for less than a month and wore it just a couple times and noticed that the super thin leather already had tears in it and some how the dye is already rubbing off i have leather jackets that are over ten years old that never torn and just look better with age this jacket wont last you a season i really hate to leave a bad review i even contacted the seller to resolve this but in order to return the jacket you have to pay the shipping and a restocking fee i guess i lose on this one,0
has not been sized right fleece is way too thick,0
this is the worst xmas outfit i have ever seen its so big it can fit a 3 year old i bought it for a one year old its nothing like what you are seeing in the picture the material looks old and feel cheap i definitely not recommend this to anyone,0
not a fan the cup seems too large and i dont like the height of its coverage i would not purchase again,0
im small 98 pounds and the bag hangs at an odd angle when i wear it water bottles the main reason i got it are too heavy and crooked i wont use but probably someone regularsized will,0
i love love love these pants oddly prana did not offer corduroy pants this year what a find to discover them on amazon overstock from last year the price is fabulous r length is nice and long a miracle and a size 6 fits perfectly i go between a 4 and 6 in most pants 6 is my goto size for prana so if you are familiar with the brand these are true to size im really hoping that prana decides to bring back the trinity cords next year but for now thank you amazon,2
bought this for my husband in a medium his normal size but had to exchange it for a large the large just gave extra comfort and length my husband loves it i also bought a camel color for my son he had the same size issue too short once we got it one size up it was a perfect fit i gave four stars due to length my guys arent giants one is 58 and the other 510 the sweaters were just too short and a little narrow however well worth just ordering a size up sweaters are gorgeous and comfortable,2
this is exactly the kind of clip i wanted for my keys i like carabiners but i dont like how the key rings would slide around on it i loved that this had a hole to attach the key ring to without having them slide aroundbr br its just too small and the clip is hard to use i like to clip my keys to the strap of my backpack while im running errands instead of putting them in my bag and the clip is really hard to push down and then its just too small to clip it onto the strap i end up having to put them in my bag anyway because the clip cant do its jobbr br i used to be able to just slap down on the strap with my carabiner to clip my keys to it before it broke and ive been trying to find the right clip ever sincebr br this one comes really close but its just too dang small ill keep using it until i find something better or if they ever come out with a larger sizebr br its well made and i love the design it just needs to be much bigger,1
if you order go up at least 2 sizes good graphics but shipping takes forever,1
loose around bust and waistline is high so not flattering had to return,1
husband liked the wallet but it took forever to arrive,1
this is a great priced lightweight jacket to keep in the car or carry around if your gonna be outside for awhile,1
ordered two pair and one pair didnt work so id say you have a 5050 chance of getting a pair that work amazon was very helpful and is allowing me to return the defective pair free of charge and has expedited the replacement so that i can get it in time for my holiday party as far as the working pair go they are as expected plastic novelty earrings that light up when you press the button on back i dont foresee these lasting until next year but theyre cheap enough that it wont matter,1
the product was just as we expected thank you,2
wast of money,0
i ordered these because i was leaving town and wanted an extra pair of shorts for some unknown reason these were sent with a signature requirement so they were not delivered when they should have been so i was unable to take them with me on my trip strikebr br i decided to look at them anywaybr br the good seem to be well constructed the army green has a sheen to it at first i didnt like it but the look goes well with shirts that i havebr br the bad the fabric is very dense so dense that i sweat more than if i was wearing jeans every time i wear these shorts i wind having to take them off because im so sweaty i put another pair of shorts on and this stops immediately this heating up factor negates the purpose of wearing shorts for me i will most likely donate these,0
i was really excited about these shoes but the foot beds are pealing after one wear so disappointed,0
its a little smaller than i thought it would be very cute but one of the metal brackets bent within 2 or 3 uses and so they little yellow knob fell off and i need to glue it back on but am afraid to unbend the metal in fear of breaking it i wouldnt order another one id try for a more sturdier one from another company,1
only got 3 strings and they were really long,1
these are beautiful and exactly what i wanted for my daughter,2
tough to get those wrinkles out of the bottom of the material is thick on the bottom,1
much larger than described order down 1 or 2 sizes from the chart size not soft material at all very stretchy color match was perfect have a verrrrry curvy figure true hour glass 29 waist 40 hips fit around my thighs but loose everywhere else for women who are a little more older in age 50 in my opinion,1
arrived in a timely manner size small fit my hand perfectly the green color was a dark green i am very satisfied with my bracelet,2
not what i expected,0
compared to my previous one this was disappointing perhaps for a few times itbr might suffice quality not quite up to par,1
ive bought variations of this shoe in suede and leather but this little number is flatout gorgeous a lowkey metallic that is as comfortable as a sneaker and yet you look absolutely kewl wearing it just about anywherebr br the silver flat actually looks great with a gown when youre walking and dont want to destroy your feet in heels you can dance and have fun in them and look great or just put them on to drive and switch to the tottering heels when you get to the ball but i bet you wont these shoes look great anywherebr br im definitely going to be investing in them in all three metallics im already on my fourth pair of this style of skechers and im just praying they keep making them best walking and looking shoe i ever owned,2
my daughter is 5 and she is relatively short and shinny 5t is small for her i should order size 6 and for those who is considering size please order 1 or 2 size up if your kids is taller or fatter,1
i specifically ordered this brand because it is my sons favorite for his birthday it is not the brand advertised it is some cheap brand from another country the shirt quality is thin not like the brand that is presented here piece of junk,0
love them fits perfectly thy are polarized and cheap than walmart,2
my second pair great comfort and value at 1999,2
i ware a size 3x however this dress was definitely not a standard size 3x it did not fit at all i ended up having to purchase another dress to attend the wedding 34in a size 3x34 which was a perfect fitbr br if these dresses are a chinese size it should be advertised as suchbr br the quality 4 out of 10br fit 0 out of 10br look 8 out of 10,0
very flimsy not worth the dollar,0
recieved earlier than expected very comfy nice fitso simple cute,2
dosent help at all,0
love the necklace and the price they are a very reliable seller delivery fast merchandise great quality i have purchased a number of things from them and have never been disappointed,2
i love these panties not only are they soft and comfy but they are feminine i love the way they look fit and feel,2
none,2
they are smaller than expected and not that comfortable,1
i ordered a small and got a medium instead additionally the stitching on one side was totally out what a waste,0
these look pretty nice i really like that the order comes with two keychains however i wish there had been some kind of indication that the packaging had a cardboard backing saying 34bai he feng34 and 34i love you34 see picture i bought these as a gift for my brotherinlaw and im kind of unsure of what to do with them now since i dont want to open the package but i also dont want to declare love for him,1
much nicer in the picture material was terrible colors not like in the picture,0
this dress is perfect ive purchased a total of 5 of them a few for myself some to give as gifts new favorite dress,2
did not fit like a dress too short it came just bellow my waist,0
the slippers are fine but i doubt my wife will ever let me be caught by anyone wearing them i have to admit now that i look at the pictures they look as described but i would say that this should only be a womans slipper,1
this is a good price for curved barbells dont expect the kind of quality youd find at a body jewelry store the stones are cheap light plastic unless someone is right up close they wont notice the white marbled on was the biggest failure for me as it was basically all white with a touch of grey on the edge in a tiny spot otherwise they look a lot like the picture at least one did irritate my skin but the others seemed fine,1
maybe its just me but i have problems sitting comfortably on my stationary bike i already bought a seat pad thats attached to the saddle and now i bought these they help somewhat but i wish it was a drastic relief and its not the padding is okay but feels weird and you definitely cant wear these alone youll see a weird shape under your butt the red padding also smelled weirdly metallic after i washed the shorts and i dont love that and the hem did dig into my legs a bit but i have thick thighs so i guess i expected it,1
was to small,0
high quality but weird fit on me too baggy on top and too tight around band might be just fine for others but not my style or comfortable sorry returned,1
i was hoping for more support,1
it doesnt look nothing like it in the photo the shirt kind of looks like a mens shirt the bottoms are nothing like leggings it was too big trust me dont buy this you will be disappointed,0
i was pleasantly surprised to see this was bigger when it arrived more a handbag than a purse its a little stiff which can be a good thing im used to my squishier purse so this one would actually stand up on a table and it comes with an arm strap which is also nice though i tend to hold purses by the handle because i like to be able to just grab it and go the one thing i didnt like though is that to close it it has one of those seeminglynotconnectedtoanything zippers you know the ones the ones you have to pull with one hand while your other hand holds tight to the actual fabric of the zipper this makes the purse seem flimsier than it is but really you dont need to use the zipper if you dont want to its just another method of securing everything to make sure it doesnt fall out im sure i wont be using the zipper much i might even see if i can just cut it offbr br edit after using this for a while now i have to say that i really am not a fan while the purse looks soft enough thats all it is looks the top corners are so sharp from the metal edging that it actually hurts when it bumps into your arm and im constantly making sure it doesnt whack my son in the head when we walk together,0
husband loved it,2
returned these because as soon as i pulled one out of the package and pulled to check stretch on the waistband it didnt move at all so like zero stretch,0
i really like this stackable very pretty,2
halloween socks were fine for the night,1
great deal,2
these are great shoes they are easy on and off although my 2 year old does not do it himself he does like to strap the velcro and can take them off easily i love the classic look of these but most importantly the toughness of them my kids are rough on shoes and i learned long ago to spend just a bit more on quality rather than buying the store brands i did have to return and reorder them once as the size was not what i was expecting but that is why i love ordering from amazon because it is so easy to do,2
loved the earrings very simple and elegant fast shipping packed great,2
prosbr feels soft and good on touchbr appears to be well madebr consbr seriously smaller than the one in the picturesbr not a slouch just a beanie,1
the shoe is reasonably comfortable but the leather is of low quality especially for the kenneth cole brand i have some kc boots that are superb but these have creased badly a sign of cheap leather rather than with multiple fine lines,1
way too small despite the size label of 24t my 3 year old is small for her size and these socks didnt cover her entire foot too bad because she otherwise loved them but i had to return them,1
i dont understand all these good ratings these are the type of leggings that show everything when you bend over due to the sheerness of the fabric these def wouldnt be good for working out in and only good to wear around with extra long shirts,0
i was so excited when i learned i could order a pair of the vanelli anemone womans shoe in a 9 narrow ive had a pair of this same shoe and after wearing them for 4 years the inner soles wore out in the heel other than that the shoes were still in good condition after reading the reviews on amazon many indicated the shows were small and not true to size but i ordered a pair anyway hoping i would be one of the lucky ones and the shoes would fit the new shoes looked great exactly like my old pair however they didnt fit it felt like i was forcing my foot into a 7 aaa instead of a 9n i returned the shoes and didnt reorder as i didnt know what sizewidth might fit these shoes were way too narrow and way too short and a bummer as i have to order all my shoes online,0
wife gave gift gift the skechers go walk 2 she is happy she say what the shoes is comfortable light and cool i recomended,2
i love the colors very vivid cool to wear but do not order normal size i usually but xl with these i need a 2 xl,1
way too small and very thin,0
pocket opening is too small everything else fits fine,1
make sure you get a larger size even getting a 12w the toes were too tight for my feet when i normally dont even require a wide boot maybe a 13w would have worked for a normal 12 but im not going back and forth to try on shoes,0
my daughter received this for christmas she loves it and wears it everyday,2
they fell apart only had them 2 months they are trash now i will never buy again,1
i love this dress so much that i bought it in 4 different colors,2
the color is more burnt orange than a brownbr i hope it darkens with agebr the space inside is great it holds my macbook air w the sleeve on still roomy for other items,1
loved it on christmas eve it fit greatthat is until i washed it totally shrunk now one of those shirts ill have to hang up wet to dry hate that,1
the black jewel ball came off the post and its internal threading insert the first time i tried to take it off to wear a different one,0
its cute and vibrant color but the sizing is way off its advertizied as 1824 months but the one i received just says 24 months and its very large and wide im going to have to return and order a smaller size,0
thin fabric,0
nice color and fabric not thin but the sizing is off definitely size down the dress was too big and the ruching was off,1
way too smsll,0
fashionable and with great support i have plantar fasciitis and can wear these sandals for hours love the neutral coor with a faux print for added style goes with everything dresses jeans capris perfect for summer,2
otherwise comfortable jc,1
love looks more expensive than it is,2
i am bit unhappy because the dangle does not set even when being worn,1
quite delicate and pretty if you like wired copper pendants and pretty stones for an affordable price then this one is for you,2
love this shirt very comfortable fit as expected exact color as well very good buy very well made would buy again,2
i returned it because despite the reviews and measuring myself the one i got did not fit on me the way it did on the model the material is cheap and to me not worth the price i ordered a medium and i am 5434 140 lbs 3334 waist 3834 hip so i thought this would be roomie and cute looking twas not 60,1
purchased as a gift very nice,2
beat fathers day girt my twins pick out for there dad he live it,2
first off i love the fit it is very comfortable i am 57 and 220lbs it falls a good 6 inches below my knees and it fits me perfectly its very comfortable the only downfall is the flowers on the dress look blurry and not as vibrant as the one pictured,2
it could be due to my body shape i have small breasts and relatively bigger hips and buttso its a bit tight in that area even though i ordered my usual size its a nice dress and i received compliments but if i had thought it over sooner i wouldve exchanged it for one size larger,2
washed one time in cold water with dreft the pjs easily shrunk 2 sizes especially the shirt,1
one of my brothers works outside year round he loves these pants true to size they are warm and waterproof the elastic in the waist provides some give they look nice not too bulky they move with you and have zippered pockets nice winter wear,2
the multi layered anklet states it is sterling silver however it is darker in color than most sterling silver jewelry and i would have liked it 12 inch longer so the extended chain could dangle a bit,1
love this so cute cozy,2
this product looks nothing like as advertised it looks so fake i was expecting a better quality,0
definitely true to size and flattering looks just like the picture,2
the belt the only part that fits,0
do not fit as well as first pair i bought,1
plus theyre soft and comfortablebr br soso the 2 wide waistband elastic isnt secured must be rolled into proper place or sewn down fabric is 95 polyester think 70s disco era mens shirts also i got an xl even tho im 53 100 a med total elastic band circumference 30 too snugbr br con took two months to get item after a month they said they didnt know where the order was a offered a refund would seriously hesitate to order products from eastern china if they have such problems fulfilling orders,0
on one page it says the masked rider is there but he isnt i went over every single inch of the page and hes just not there also on several pages he doesnt actually look like what the example to find looks like also some items that youre supposed to find such as a bag of popcorn may be in the picture but theyve 34hidden34 the items behind other pictures so much you cant tell if theyre actually there or not,0
k,0
this is an average quality cycling shoe upper pui and mesh fabric with air holes that reduce feet sweating,1
returned it looked gray but was shipped white ones good quality though,1
the photo shown does not reflect what i received while the skull design on the front is the same i was expecting a compartment like the photo shows expecting i could put my medication for the afternoon inside its a very small pill but the compartment in the ring is so shallow you wouldnt be able to fit much of anything insideeven folks using it for more questionable purposes may find that its not going to hold enough the silver color on the ring looks more like paint than actual metal overall not satisfied on the other hand my 6 year old was happy to add it to the dressup collection,0
i wear a size 12 and these socks run small the heal section of the sock sits under my foot not at the heal theyre constantly sliding off my foot inside of my work boots and im constantly adjusting them these socks are no thicker than cheap walmart socks and in no way keep your feet warm this is my first day and last day wearing them to work,0
no i would not,0
they fit really well and are easy to decorate,2
it is beautiful,2
great shoes for my growing son,2
cute but large,1
shoulders and sleeves great body is very fitted not like the picture,1
they were just too small for my liking so i sent them back looked pretty in person however and i loved all of the inclusions,1
they are very small and fall out easily,1
only used this a short time when the zipper section for coins ripped and everything fell to the opposite end of the purse youd think for the price it would have held up better i liked the design but the strap that holds your credit cards from falling out allows them to slip out if you have more than a few nice but could be better,0
used for spray painting liked very much,2
im size 8 on every sport shoe this one is half a size longer it says is size 39br the front of the shoe is very wide as you can see on the picture they dont come on 12 sizes and i think ordering a size 7 it will be too small,1
just threw away about half socks i bought in january cause they had holes in the heel toes ball of foot as well as cuff i got the black ones they leave black fuzzies all over my foot every time i wear them no matter how many times they are washedbr i bought them again cause im too lazy to try other brands and they will match the socks that survived the last purge try a different brand unless your lazy like me,0
arrived on time only 2 styles in bag while picture shows all different size is more like a large than xlargesmall,0
not what i expected,1
ok so they dont come off completely but my heel constantly feels like its going to slide out ive tried changing insoles using heel grips tying the laces with a runners knot no matter what my heel starts to lift out and if i do a calf stretch my heel will come out completely the size is perfect its just a poorly designed heel cup,1
it says pink satin ladies on it,1
i purchased this shirt in large and it was too short and a bit snug like a fitted shirt so i got another in xl and its way too big in every way im 57 175 lbs dad bod these shirts are nice but dont have a chest pocket,1
it did not fit plus was thin false advertising do not buy i order 3x dang how big of a size do you have to order gave to my daughter in law fit her perfect even though she wear a junior size,0
will not purchase again,1
very thin and see through almost like panty hose but i bought for her to wear under her dresses,1
i ordered these because i am a water skier and i wear glasses when i ski i like that they hold the glasses on your face but they do not put any pressure on your face which is good i do not like these because they do not float if they are in water for more than five minutes i wish they floated better the one thing they will do is slow down the sinking of sunglasses and in most cases of me falling off the tube or water skis they will either stay in my face or if they do fall off the strap will slow down the sinking time enough for me to react and to catch them,1
its not detailed like the picture it looks like its fading once you get it i returned it as soon as i opened it,0
i bought these for my 10 year daughter and she loves them wears them all the time the quality is great and they look great as well super soft,2
im thin and i feel hideous in these i dont know i got influenced and it was a miss for me the material is clingy and staticy and not warm weather friendly the band is tight i would size up unless you want skinny pants,1
not too comfortable,1
son refused to wear them after one try very slippery,0
i liked the way this fit my curves and the length is prefect for me highlow makes feel like i have train on my dress,2
love the capacity,2
first day wearing them and they brokei may have had them on 2 hours they looked really cute but made very cheaply,0
too many reviews for this product are paid for by reducing the cost of the scarf i paid full price so my review is real the actual size is much smaller than shown it barely ties in the back on the up side the fabric is light weight and very pretty i am going to keep it,0
seems high quality very cute tropicalsummer print band is clear with a print on top of it excited to wear all summer,2
order a larger size runs small nice fabric,2
the large bottle for home use does not have a sprayer with it which means you have to go buy a different bottle seems to work ok but that is very inconvenient,0
i love these socks soft and dont lose shape throughout the day buti just found a hole in he toe of one pair third time wearing,1
i did not like the removable cups and there was zero hold maybe for a regular bra but definitely not for the gym,0
great necklace do you know how hard it is to find rhodium plated silver its nearly impossible im stocking up on them one word of caution however dont wear silver in the swimming pool even though its rhodium plated it still isnt a good idea the chlorine ruins silver and gives it a tarnish you will never get out im not talking about this necklace specifically ive ruined rings that were plated i highly recommend this necklace and being adjustable too perfectbr feb24th of the 5 different rhodium plated chains i ordered this one is the brightest of the bunch its lighter and highly polished its so much prettier with the pendants i own which are a high grade fine silver really this is the best of the lot,2
soft cushioning perfect fit,2
super uncomfortable feels like having a rubber band around your waist and when i loosen them they are o use not a good buy for me,0
i really have tried to love spikerking socks honestly i have based upon the reviews i have read they are reasonably priced and have a good selection of colors and styles this is my third separate order of their brand of socks and my opinion is for the price they are not durable they are just too inconsistent in their quality i have purchased other brands that have held up for multiple years and are still in my sock drawer this is not the case for spikerking at all for the price you can get a better value in fashion comfort and durability keep looking if you are the type of person who gets irritated when you put on a perfectly good looking pair of socks in the morning only to have a toe protruding after 3pm,0
it broke the 2nd day,0
just be aware unless you choose 34short34 or 34long34 these pants ship unhemmed,2
runs big but good for a work shirt,1
this is a beautiful belt crafted for years of wearbr br would make a thoughtful useful gift,2
not parrot proof,1
way to tightnot at all what i expected,0
this watch looks amazing for the price i got a lot of compliments on it and everyone thought it was so expensive the only bad thing is that the gold color on the band has faded the gold color has now turned into a silver color but the head of the watch has stayed gold no one has really noticed the band color change so its not anything completely horrible overall a good buy in my eyes,1
this is a very cute little dish i love what the hamsa stands for and plan to use this on my vanity it looks exactly like the picture in the ad and came well packaged its a pretty little ringjewelry dish and im very happy with it its a good deal for a cute little novelty dish,2
great craftsmanship very good looking boot,2
they are okay they are a little tight on my head but something is weird with the polarizedness of the glasses they take away the glare but they distort somethings and it gives me a headache after a while they are nicely made though,1
very good,2
very comfy for my hiit workouts im 5634 and heavier at 190lbsbr br update knocked it down from 5 stars to 3 i only use these for my workouts in the gym 30 min 3x a week since november this is my 3rd pair of this type of shoe yet i could tell it was made a bit differently sadly the sole started separating from the shoe last week first time thats happened sad they started coming apart after only 5 months of use,1
love this shirt admittedly i have a bit of an obsession with breton shirts and i was pretty impressed with this one for the price its soft and fits true to size its really cute and can definitely be dressed up or down im planning on wearing it to work quite a bit looks good by itself with jeans or a vest im 511 170 lbs and i ordered a large fits great,2
i read the reviews and noticed a common trend were people reported the zipper broke i bought it anyway well the zipper broke after about four uses i will not second guess my fellow reviewers in the future,0
product held up well when washing,2
bought these for a cute spider costume and they were perfect,2
have this is not what i expected the quality was very thin the poor material im sending it back was not happy with this dress at all it looked very cheap,0
cup size fit,0
too small,1
these gloves are perfect the fit snug on your hands but not too tight the give in the fabric makes the fit perfect the touch screen use is the best ive seen from a glove ive never had gloves that you dont have to hard presss to get the screen to move if that makes sense theyre just warm enough the grip makes them great for driving on cold mornings i love them,2
i have owned several versions of the reebok princess sneaker over the years it is a reasonable lightweight sneaker with a pretty flat sole this version is attractive and fits fine but it is not leather and the shoelaces that come with it are pretty lame,1
nice wallet great price,2
these espadrille wedge sandals are super cute they fit really well except for the toe box unfortunately my big toes feel like they are being pushed down i am hoping that the shoes will stretch out over time but right now they are a bit uncomfortable,1
just like the picture in terms of pattern and color but its not tickbr nice thin one though big too,2
had to return because 1st purchase bust fit perfect bottoms too large 2nd purchase smaller size bust waaaaaay too small and bottoms fit perfect wasnt willing to buy both suits to get right fit,0
beautiful,2
didnt really fit wore them once and gave them away,0
came from walmart in walmart packagerip off,0
difficult to keep straps in the device,1
bought these because i wanted to have my sunglasses float but they dont nice design and comfy,0
great fit not see through,2
love the colors fits great i order larger this would have fit in my actual size so a little roomy but super comfybr only thing is after first wash there is a hole on the seam of the leg after three washes hole in the seam of the left sleeve of shirt i only wear them once a weekbr disappointed i have to repair it so soon they were immediately my favorite jammies and just hoping no other holes pop up,0
the product looked different in person,1
nice looking bracelet,2
awesome,2
i expected be able to see through them some but they are thinner than other brands out there also very scratchy and annoying tag placement on your butt,1
sandal fits well but the vertico sticker was already starting to peel off on the sandal upon receipt along with the rubber on the bottom,1
i love my new purse it was exactly what i wanted,2
this dress is stunning and very flattering highly recommend,2
it was easy to wear but some information has come out that they are not safe,2
adorable bag smaller than my average satchel but yet its still cute,2
the pearls are much larger than i expected otherwise they are ok,1
love the color fits good great price so very comfortable,2
bigger than expected,1
material is fine for the price the cut is very figure flattering does not run true to size its small wouldnt recommend for busty girls,1
i barley even pushed the stick through the first hole not even through my ear yet and it snapped and now doesnt have a hole to go through cheap and lazy craft mens ship,0
so cute great price,2
this pair of shoes lasted 1 and a half month before i changed it usually it takes at least half of the school year before i buy a new pair for my son i got size 1 for my 8 yr old fit as expected regular size feet not wide after 2 weeks it already got folds in the front and holes on soles i got 2 shoes from payless store during their 40 off everything sale instead and i am pretty impressed on what i got it cost me 13 bucks each but my son said these were very comfortable and light,0
my husband ordered size 13 but they looked more like a size 10 and didnt fit him at all it was almost like they were mislabeled because hes worn size 13 aldo shoes lots of times,0
beautiful bracelet gave it 3 stars because it does not open as advertised,1
its big enough to hold everything room for everything will be used as my carryon bag for my next trip,2
quality of material is not what i expected,1
bought this for 1599 a bot over a year ago what an increasebr dont you wish you had the ability to make your paycheck increase like thisbr will never do biz here againbr quality is just ok nothing special,0
my husband bought me the bear paw and i love it its lighter then i expected but still feels like pewter i love the design which is well stamped on it mine has an interesting double wave symbol on the back i dont know it would be there but it looks like a wave scene shrugs fine by me as i work with polar bear nice product cord material isnt bad ive had worse i i plan to put it on a tougher chaincord as it is my preference,2
beautiful dress great fit,2
i love love these sandals awesome comfort for a high arch i bought a second pair in another color because they are so comfortable,2
the fit was fine i ordered large and typically wear a womens medium that said i just didnt care for it the fabric type along with the solid brownish buttons and the obvious seam running up the middle of the back give this shirt a cheap appearance im returning,0
its a very nice apron and very well sewn but unfortunately m size is a little bit too small for me and i am a thin person if there was a l size it would have been perfect,1
i got this as a gift for my sister she loves the golden girls shes going to use it for her shoes at work bag was adorable it came as described and on time,2
it was a gift for my wife and when she unwrapped it it 5 strings about 12 long were hanging off the edge and when she pulled on one of them the edge started to unravel she had to sit on christmas night and sew all the ends in so that it wouldnt fall apart before she wore it very disappointed,0
love this bra i recommend trying these if you are having a hard time finding a wireless bra that fits well generally i use underwire bras but these are a nice bra to change to nice bra,2
i have a 40 waistand the xl was too long,1
poor quality,0
these pants are very nice looking however they just dont seem to fit correctly i usually fit a size 14 but can wear anything from a 12 to a 16 depending on cut and style stretch jeans are particularly flexible and i usually fit all 3 sizes initially these pants fit exactly as i was expecting them to slim to my body but not skin tight but also not loose anywhere seemed great however after wearing them for just a couple minutes i realized that the cut of them wasnt ideal it seemed like they were midrise jeans from where they sat at my waist but unfortunately the back side kept creeping down apparently the cut of these jeans were not made for anyone who actually has much of a butt the front waistband stayed where it was supposed to but every time i moved sat bent the back would slide down more and more until it was barely above my cheeks i had to keep hiking it up the back sliding down caused the front to become tighter at my waist after about 10 to 15 minutes i just had to change because i was tired of wrenching up the back of my pants and im not comfortable when the back is lower than the front i know a lot of women dont mind this but im not one of them ill try them again on another day since as most women know the fit of clothes can be different from day to day depending on many factors but my initial impression is that these particular jeans just arent made for someone with more than a very streamlined backside too badbr br 1 star awful want my money backbr 2 stars bad but not horrendousbr 3 stars decentgoodbr 4 stars really goodbr 5 stars excellent definitely recommend,0
poor quality,0
the fabric could have been better,1
muy bonitos y buen precio,2
yego el vestido el mismo color pero pequeño,0
just a basic skirt nice length but not the best quality fabric,1
very very very light weight material would be great for summer time it just wasnt really what i was looking for in terms of color or fit,1
daughter loves these super comfy great grip,2
i love this dress looks just like the pictures it fits great im a big girl who doesnt like my arms out but we were going to a wedding in jamaica so i wanted something bright that wouldnt be to hot and that would cover my arms this dress was perfect the color orange was vibrant the ruffles cover my arms the split in the front gives a little sexiness and it perfect for busty girls because of the vneck this is a great buy i recommend and its definitely true to size,2
very nice boots but fit is too small,1
love this product the color is amazing and i love the hood,2
fabulous socks,2
material is very thin and the shirt runs about 2 sizes small,1
i am wearing it today and it is pure heaven it makes me think of a soft hug i hate heavy robes and it definitely isnt it like wrapping up in a down comforter its as soft as a babys blanket i absolutely love it,2
i am 53 130 lbs and typically wear a xsmall to small in shirts i ordered these in medium and they were way too tight,0
fit and as is shown,1
poor quality,0
i purchased size l the arms are for giants seriously giants not the sf giants but giants its extra large in the belly area and arms considering ordering size 1 to 2 sizes down this shirt was defiantly sized by a girl that said oh im a size small our reply no youre not,1
very nice material the large fit our ten year old perfect,2
i didnt like the material i returned it,1
very beautiful very elegant i love the white and rose gold combination makes it look very stylishbr i 100 recommend it,2
really cute set has so much potential was hoping my daughter could wear them on her first and second hole but half of them arrived so bent from shopping that weve had to mix and match i was able to straighten one with pliers but the other one broke as i tried to bend it straight they are a cute shape and have a minimalistic look the sizes vary just slightly so they can be worn coordinating in multiple piercings or on their own since they all go together well they mix and match nicely backs are a thick clear rubber arrived on a card in a small paper envelope without padding little pearls and sparkles are so dainty and cute seems like theyll wear nice ill update once i observe if they irritate or turn green,0
will buy again,2
my son is in love with his shoe but it cant fit and we cannot return it his other booths are 55 and its the size i bought and its tight even with the insole out,1
i wish they were full length but the fit design is awesome so i kept them and wear as ankle leggings im 5834,2
the band fell apart in my hands out of the package,0
this is was i expected to receive got 4 metal bottom underneath the bag but what received is totally no metal bottom two different picture one is the seller and the other i took a picture went i received wrong im very disappointed,0
i absolutely love thesebr i ordered this ankle boot for a vacation trip these boots are extremely comfortable and stylish,2
planned out a halloween theme with a group of friends with babies and we decided to do minions overall the costume is cute but pieces were poorly made the eyes on the headpiece arent facing the same direction and the neck line was a bit tight for my 9 month old son,1
the laces feels like it could break any second and theyre too short they need more holes for the laces to go through so it would secure and tighten the shoes more bcuz they are pretty loose,1
way too long,0
i ordered this dress for an interview and it was perfect the dress fit very well,2
they look a little silly but they do the job very well i was worried about them popping off but they stayed on they whole time even thorugh gravel and wet grass they were made of softer rubber on the top so they didnt damage my shoe once the wedding was over i was able to pop them off put them in my purse and head to the reception i didnt have to change my shoes great invention others were a little jealous,2
loved it wears everywhere well made well worth the price,2
doesnt for like posted,0
good quality,2
very cute shoe but i wanted it for a big girl size 4 to 6 is what i ordered it was not the product that i wanted i wanted it for a big kid and i got it toddler size,0
i received these to wear to my husbands birthday event luckily what we were doing was outside because these things while cute and fit great smelled terrible as if they were on a fish box that was shipped to me when i opened the package it hit you like a bag of bricks i had to wash them five times and left them on my porch to air out for two days the smell subsided enough where i felt it possible for me to wear them but i was still self conscious i dont know if it was just my pair or if others have experienced this but it was terrible once i wore them i washed them another three times and finally they smelled what would be considered normal just beware you may get a pair smelling like this so be prepared other than that they looked and fit amazing,1
the pink is very very see through unwearable returned,0
look i have the previous version and it was good light but a little bulky this one looks real sweet compare to the originals they definitely feel like sneakers because of how light they are very very well made and i wear them with jeans and always with vertx delta stretch pants and they look really really sharp had it for over a month now and im still amazed in the build quality and the shape i know there are not for rough or heavy use there are light shoes for light wear they pretend to look tactical but are not i highly recommend them,2
the cap looks nice fits well pretty comfy havent tried the buttons but they seem to be in the right spot the small business thing is a gimmick for sure the product is clearly labled made in china but it does the job i guess,1
love that it flashes bought it as a gift for my dad for christmas and he wore it his first night game recently and loved it he said he was approached by many people who wanted to know where he got it,2
the shoes are super cute but left blisters in multiple locations on my feet not at all comfortable,1
im usually a large and these were xl and still too small you get what you pay forbr br edit the company kindly sent me an xxl and that actually fits albeit a bit loosely their large is really a small,0
great gift,2
what i dont likebr 1 too small sizes 612 is actually sizes 68br 2 materials too hard i think the actual material content is the opposite at least 80 is not cottonbr 3 the cut is too low much lower than the pictures show they dont cover my ankle bonesbr what i likebr 1 price less than 1pairbr 2 packaging although they are thrown away anyway,0
cool but very flimsy back piece,1
it is very nice waking up in the morning and putting on toasty warm boots in the morning y e p,2
i bought this shirt for compression after a lumpectomy i was told to by a size smaller for compression it works great in the arms and fairly compressed in the body the colors are vibrant and it seems to be a good quality shirt i would definitely buy more i did wash it but hung it up to dry,2
too baggy,1
this blouse fit nicely and looked good i really like it,2
the frame was bent and the noise support was not even so the glasses were on a slant plus on the end of the frame the white paint was chipping off,0
the size run large so if you wear size 10 get a size 9 the back of my ankle also got rub sore i had a little cut on my ankle by the time i took it off,1
see my review title says it allbr large may be us 68 in childrens but not adult,1
love it,2
i purchased this jacket of my sons birthday he loved it and was sad when the weather warmed up and i made him put it away the only con he found is that there was not a inside pocket other than that we were pleased with the jacket and he will be able to wear it another winter,2
cheap and will wear it just disappointed dont look like picture shown here,1
love it nice and big but not too big love the design with the link i dnt really generally care for the white colors inside the link buts its nice very pretty would recommend,2
super cute on my 2 year old but four days of wearing and the toe part is tearing apart already might not make it til winter,1
a little small not too sturdy,1
love the material but its too big,1
nice top comfortable not super seethrough and its nice and flowy would recommend going a size up as the elastic in the shoulder area can be a bit tight,2
unfortunately these cohesion 14s werent made as well as my last pair of cohesion 13 sneakers im unable to wear them because one of the shoes is defective at the heel and ive only had them about 4 months,0
this is a great light weight but warm beanie it is perfect for cold weather outdoor exercise and is nice and thin to fit under a ski helmet for an extra layer of warmth you cant go wrong with merino,2
terrible shoes nothing like ive ourchased before,0
had me looking right in vegas,2
as others have noted the colour of the stones is more insipid in person i ordered madeira citrine which is generally dark orange what i got was a pale yellow colour i found it hard to take a helpful picture still pretty and very comfortable but not accurate,1
super cute boots i really like the looks of them yes they do run big i usually wear a 9912 so i bought a 9 and they are a bit big nothing that a pair of think socks wouldnt take care of the problem is that they are impossible to get on if you have bare feet they will slide on but add socks to the equation and you are in for a battle your foot stops at the slide in point at the heel and the only way to get them on is with shear force pulling the problem with that is there is not a lot of material to grab and if you have long fingernails you are out of luck sorel really should have put a zipper on the side that would make these boots perfect if it wasnt for the fact that they are super cute and i have already worn them i would probable return them,1
i really like this shirt but i will not come wrinkle free the material this is made from makes it so you cannot iron it i followed the washing instructions so this will be a shirt used only for fishing nice shirt though,1
great quality exactly what i wanted however really dislike that there is 34yogacase tm34 printed on the case,2
the dress is true to color and size the slit comes up high and looks glamorousi wore this dress for the holidays and got many compliments would look good for any special occasion,2
these are decent briefs ive worn the adidas climalite and climacool and the exofficio giveandgo and i think the champions are my least favorite of the bunch they arent bad and for some may be better in colder weather but the material is a little thicker and a little heavier and a little less soft than the others and the fit a little less forgiving in terms of snugness around the thighs still much better than cotton to be sure but id recommend one of the others instead of these,1
i bought this with the idea that it would fit went according to the size chart it was way too small but the material is quality and the workmanship is nice,1
this top was returned it was not flattering and it did not fit well very cute but it did not work out for me,0
disappointed didnt come with a clasp in front as pictured and also had a hole in the shoulder,0
the smell was so offensive it gave me a migraine i decided to try and wash the lining bc it left my hands smelling so bad just from trying them on black dye just started coming off of it really disappointed i bought these so i could shovel if they bleed dye imagine when im having to deal with snow the fingers were laughably long too the touchscreen feature did work but since my fingers were so far from the tips of the glove it was super hard to even use my phone do not recommend,0
im sending them back the backs fall off,0
such a beautiful dress so versatile and flatteringbr you can wear it as a shift for historical costumes i have it in white as well from another seller or a nightybed gown or just a day dress and did i mention this dress was made for layering pettie coats corsets stays vests belts and so much more or you can just wear it by itself it is a bit sheer but i actually like it that way but if you dont just get a slip or camisole and problem solved lolbr its such a fun article of clothing highly recommend wish it came in more colorspatterns,2
i returned this as a sports bra it doesnt provide any support for high impact exercise it was comfortable and i was debating about keeping it for a lounge bra however i decided to return it because i need a good supportive high impact sports bra as a larger chested woman i expected more out of this style and glamorise,0
boots are as pictured and very comfortable i ordered my usual size 7 and they fit great,2
used these on party favors they were a hit very nice and great price,2
i really wanted to love this sports bra but the straps keep coming undone other than that the fit is good and when its hooked it is really comfortable im not sure what movement loosens the strap hooks but i end up basically wearing it as a halter sports bra until i can rehook the straps maybe the angle isnt right on me but i may end up just sewing it to make it nonadjustable,0
i bought a 3x because i wanted baggy to wear with leggings ended up offering to my 9 yr old niece its so very small horrible fit,0
not large as it says,1
hated this shirt the fit was fine but the fabric was awful and i did not like the color i returned it,0
she loves this anime wears it every day when she washes it she put it right back on hot out the dryer,2
believe the negative reviews its really long that may be good for you if you are tall but it is super big every where also the seams is in a weird place so i am going to take it apart and shorten it there so that the seam isnt in the most unflattering placeright where you belly is the biggest the top also doesnt match the bottom but i will wear it will a jean jacket over itbr br if you dont mind having to play seamstress and also want to wear a jacket over it then its not a bad price otherwise i would skip it,0
very cute sweet and love the design i feel its a little pricey though it is true to size for my 5 year old,2
i got these in a 3x because the reviews seemed iffy on how true to size they would be i usually wear a short inseam size 2022 the material feels really thin not like itll rip easily thin but its not a thick or high quality fabric think like fake jean material not jegging i dont think its breathable either so if youre in a hot environment or sweat this may be a bit stinky by end of day i tried them on and immediately knew i needed to return im 5 feet 2 inches and the pants not only went up to my midsection but they were awkwardly loose and going past my heel cuffing wont work since the print is only on the outside i think going down a size to my true size would help some aspects but then i fear it would still be too long and would fit too snug to hide the fact im wearing pants so high up so im going to probably pass on these,1
not even worth the 1 star i purchased the antica murrina veneziana cancun necklace bracelet earrings as a christmas surprise for my sister on november 28th i received a your order has been shipped email on november 30th with a tracking numbering it is now december 18th and i still do not have my purchase when i view ups to track it has been stuck in the ups warehouse since december 1st i have called ups over a halfdozen times and each person gives me a different answer as to why its being held in customs i finally got tired of doing the leg work and emailed forzieri the jewelry vendor 3 times to see if they had better luck someone finally emailed me back on december 16th saying they would look into why its being held i have not received anything further from them at this point i am extremely frustrated and disappointed this was supposed to be a fun christmas surprise for my sister who had this jewelry on her wishlist i cant believe the time im spending just to get this package,0
i love them they are thin and dainty,2
perfecto,2
tight and restricting even though a size larger was ordered gave them away,1
cheep chinese metal makes a pretty but still cheap chinese jewelery try to find something not made in communist china and youll get a better product,1
ive worn a number of gator style masks these are by far the most uncomfortable ones ive worn look elsewhere i know mission brand is super overpriced but at least theyre comfortable,0
they starting tarnish just got them tuesday but still cute i guess,1
works for what is for they do smell funny but its not like is go around sniffing my shoes all the time,2
love the quality of these legging i have a few in other colors but returned the green because it was more of a gray color,0
these skirted leggings were nothing like what is advertised in the listing picture the legs were baggy and hung loosely the image shows a form fitting legging they were very awkward and unflattering i had to return them,0
light cheap material a little over prices for what you get would not wear in public,1
i know this is not the real disney one and i got it for cheap so i should not expect much i just didnt expect it to be so flimsy it does not hug your head the way a headband should im guessing it would work on kids because it wont hurt the back of their ears i thought it was one adult and one kid size but theyre both the same size will easily fall off on rides if you wear it to disneyland,1
if your kiddo has thick glasses these wont work its hard to get them on the glasses even though it say thick glasses are okay,1
i havent had a polarized pair of sunglasses before and now i realize what i was missing out on they really cut down on the road glare when i am driving i do not like that it makes looking at my phone a bit difficult i have to take the glasses off to use itbr br these are super cute glasses and are very comfortable to wear they do not have a separate nose piece which i am happy for they are very well made and feel like they will last a long timebr br i dont like the glass case they came with it is a zippered case which isnt easily accessible when i am trying to drive it takes two hands to get them in and out after trying once i threw the case away and am using a pouch that another pair of glasses came inbr br i would not have paid 100 for these,1
i was pleasantly surprised to see the large selection of earrings in this order there is such a nice selection of sizes for each earring type i dont think ill ever be lacking for the perfect size,2
videoidf191229150686e261b42ce9be60bfe05 me gustó la calidad i se mira bien pero no tiene el broche y no puedo usarlo me gustaría que revisen mejor antes de enviar,0
they fit fine if im lounging around the house i guess theyre ok for work theyre not going to be useful one wash and they need heavy ironing spend a bit more for the wrinkle proof brands,0
these are beautiful plugs dont be fooled though these are not in any way shape or form real gem stones i shouldve known and am pretty disappointed as i use gems and precious stones as energy moderators otherwise theyre pretty and you get some variety with different colors and textures i just cant get past the faux stone it should be advertised as such perhaps then i wouldnt feels so bamboozled,1
bought these for my elderly mom who has some swelling in her feet and found that the tops dont stretch very well and they seem to be somewhat shorter than the photo shows they are probably fine if you have small ankles but didnt work well for us,1
nice inexpensive earrings so much easier than trying to screw on the little balls with longer nails,2
too many patches short zipper and bad metal closeure,1
demasiado bueno,2
was broken when i received i tried to fix it and it started to fall apart more,0
it was misshaped after being shoved in a box and it smelt weird but it looked like the picture i guess i didnt need it to look good so i wouldve kept it for what i needed it for had i ended up using it but i didnt end up needing it and the people at ups certainly looked at me funny when i brought this is to return lol fun gag gift,0
nice dress,1
these shirts have really rough fabric washing didnt soften it up either,0
too narrow,0
love these shirts sized as expected soft and looks really good,2
i tried 2 pairs of these they have bugs in the socks some kind of mites was biting my legs i have big marks and bumps now all over my legs and feet cant recommend these,0
i bought these for my husband who struggled a lot more getting compression stockings without zippers on and off they are snug as they should be and its still not easy but he is now able to handle them without any help,2
looks exactly like the picture it was too big because i sized up when i shouldnt have order your regular size and it will be plenty big and comfy it is not a thick sweatshirt which is nice very comfortable and soft i washed it in my washer just turned it inside out did the same with the dryer i love mine,2
the product is exactly as described in every way and it is perfect all the cards fit in nicely unlike some other reviewers i have no problems with the way it closes in terms of the placement of the cards and there is plenty of room for everything without being bulky and i have no trouble snapping it shut nice that it has two snap locations in case you only have a few cards and want it to close more tightly i only wish i had chosen a brighter color i got the medium blue color and it is pretty but subdued and i should have gone with one of the red tones,2
its a perfect gift but you have to be careful very pointy,1
i really wanted to like this and technically it fit okay however i ordered an extra large when i usually wear a large so i expected this to fit a little loose instead it is form fitting it doesnt look bad but it is tight enough that i dont feel comfortable wearing it to work as a teacher,1
i really liked the hatbut the brim was too large i returned it today however im going to buy it again with the 34medium34 brim all in all its a fabulous hat i really like it especially because it will be good for packing for travel,2
the picture looked really good but when it arrived it was awful the quality is extremely poor i got this for my daughter birthday but had to return it,0
order khaki pants but size was too big no problem got the right size in time great service my son loves your brand and style thanks,2
not skinny jeans zipper always shows,0
i found these to be 34hot34 and a bit too stretchy and made of thin material not very impressed with the quality the colors are cool and they are fun and inexpensive but i would have rather bought a few of a better quality product,1
these didnt fit right even though they were the right size they were a bit uncomfortable in places sent back for a refund,0
i bought 2 pairs in different colors im a short size 14 so i expected the length to be too longbr the pants fit like leggingsbr i ordered size xl but the waist was really tight,0
when i first ordered the sneaker was perfect very comfortable i bought these to replace another pair i wore them twice and by the third time i noticed some fraying at the stitch line in the front i thought ok no biggie i can just put some fray away on it then on the fourth wear i look down and there is a big hole on the side i dont do any heavy walking in them and only wore for fashion i was very disappointed i took them to a shoe maker to fix and it cost more to fix than what i paid for the sneakers,1
stretch during wear is a bit more than id like,1
very pretty,0
if youre a big girl itll be comfy for around the house but it was very un flattering when i put it on disappointed i cant wear it to the amusement park now,1
this shirt is actually really well made the material is sewn well and the fabric feels great i normally wear a 2x and order a size bigger but considering the biggest they had was 2x i relentlessly ordered a 2x i cant say i was as disappointed as i thought i would be the shirt initially fit it fit a little bit small but it was still wearable after being washed and dried it shrunk and doesnt fit any longer the lettering looks nice but my concern would be how long it would last up in the washbr br i really like this shirt i just wish they had bigger sizesbr br 34 i received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review 34,1
beautiful my sisters loved them,2
these are great until you wash them the color fades quick even with hand washing,1
when i first tried this bra on it felt so comfortable stretch was great covered all around my boobs but as the day went along i started feeling the wire poking me bra was no good after that and actually tore in the middle,1
broke off the post my first time putting them in,0
the sleeves are like highwaters on jeans sending back,1
these are beautiful and well made boots they run small and fit really tight the heel is a good height if your feet run closer to narrow these will work for you,1
thought this was mostly wool or 5050 winter cap but mostly acrylic brim end of cap was uncomfortable at first that being saidi like it very much liner sewn in feels like a more expensive hat very soft,2
cheap dont waste your money broke within the first couple of days,0
horrible,0
tiny they lie about sizes,0
1 a bit narrow the soles thin and hard the insoles too thin too and needed to be replaced from an old pairbr br 2 became very uncomfortable after wore less than 10 times because the shape of the soles changed trash bin become its home nowbr br the worst pair i ever bought not recommended,0
the london blue topaz stones are just beautiful in this ring just a beautiful piece of jewelry,2
i received this dress today i tried it on and as my arm was going through one sleeve i got someone elses hair gross my hair is black and not dyed someone must had ombré hair bc i was getting a lot of their hair so gross,1
its ok arrived so late i had forgotten what they were arrived without any information about the product wont buy again,1
i normally wear a 2x in mens tshirts so i ordered a 2x it was way too small it didnt stretch at all and didnt even begin to cover my chest area i ended up having to return it,0
coloring runs more on the orange side sizing is off and shirt runs on small size order larger size if going to purchase,0
our son loved this mask for halloween it looked very good it is difficult to see out the little eye holes so he just pulled it up in between houses it was also a cold night so heat wasnt an issue as this is a pretty thick plasticrubber material,2
they shift down while walking i constantly have to pull them up they are really stretchy ill have it up to you if thats good or bad i am very used to wearing too big sweat pants though so maybe im just not used to stretchy leggings,1
have several tops and bottoms by now even bought some for my sister cooler weather and im nice and toasty both day amp night,2
fits good lights suck the shoes never want to charge all the way,1
other than sport socks this what i wear and have for getting close to 20 years a mom and pop outfit they have super service after the sale as well as amazing product very highly recommended,2
this review is only for other tall girls out there these seem like excellent leggings but if youre tall like me 6 ft these will not be anklelength they stopped about 4 inches above my ankle this would be fine just for working out but i wanted something versatile to also wear as pants under tunics and dresses unfortunately these wont work for that purpose,1
the straps were too loose and caused the top to sag and reveal bust there were snags in the dress when it came and no tags attached,1
took a 34c really nice,2
i wear a size14 bottom and ordered a 3xxx shirt i like my shirts loose the material was so soft and remained that way after washing i ordered a second shirt for my friend she wears a medium and i ordered her a large it fit great what could be better than a golden retriever and the american flag,2
papery and boxy not flatterying and i have a rather hourglass shape weird,0
i really wanted to like these after reading all of the great reviews i was so excited to get thesebr have worn them twice and i wish i could return thembr for me they fit very strange good through the hips and thighs but the waist waistband creates the most unflattering muffin top it hits in a weird place and it seems like the waist band is the only part of the upper part that holds you in so its creates a bulging unattractive look i have to keep yanking them up to try to make the waist higher and its tight and uncomfortable i carry some weight in my middle but not so much that ive had issues with other jeansbr i wouldnt buy again,0
one of the earings claps did not work,0
i hate buying clothes online scared they wont fit true to size however i bought this small for my son who is about 5ft tall and slim he usually wears a 1618 youth or small tops in men this fits with enough room to wear a hoodie underneath if desired he wore this in 30 degree weather and said it was the best coat hes worn so far i def recommend,2
theyre rainbow underwear what more do you want i will suggest ordering down a size im usually a large in most things but in these im a medium my pant size varies between 32 and 34,2
broke down,1
great quality material you cant never go wrong with the fruit of the loom brand,2
looks nice and good quality but this hat is not as warm as you might hopebr br needs to be a little thicker to keep cold winds out when it gets below 30 degrees its chilly,1
the item title at the time i ordered this at the time of my review is rather misleading it currently states bellivera quilted lightweight jacket womenpuffer loose coat cotton filling for spring and fall the care tag says otherwise this is a 100 synthetic jacket it is 100 polyester aka an oil byproductbr br the fit does run large i like to have a bit of room in my jackets so i can layer so i have better range of motion i normally wear size xss tops will opt for sm or med for my jackets depending on the style even occasionally going with a large seeing reviews mention this runs very large i went with a xs the xs fits just fine it is roomy but not too big it allows me the freedom of movement that is so important to me i am a petite irish lass who is 52 120lbsbr br it is not a flattering jacket however i do love the color i ordered 2404green its an olive green if you need to replace the liner to one of your winter coats this should do nicely or if you want to layer it under a more durable jacket i have real puffer jackets liners they are filled with down this is very similar to thembr br overall this is okay i dont plan on wearing it out if it was more flattering i would save it to wear out as it is ill be using it on my farm while i dont want it to get ruined id much rather ruin this than something better looking of better quality,1
i have tried a lot of compression stockings and these are my least favorite if i am in pain they dont go nearly high enough not as pictured for sure but then again most stockings are much more expensive and on a smaller or petite women they might work,1
this ring guard is hilariously cheap it is scratchy the gold color faded after a week and it was bent when i got it but it was very inexpensive and it does the job im going to go to a jeweler and have them put in a better one,1
i love this costume the quality the size everything a great choice for this pricei am absolutely satisfied with this outfit,2
i really love maidenform bras this one in particular is so so so comfortable the band is smoothing and doesnt dig into your sides and make you have armpit fat the cups are very seamless under clothing as well my only gripe is that i do wish it was lined a little bit more on the cups,2
it was a little large but that was my fault for ordering an xxl and should have ordered an xl the quality is great for the price i am going to order another one now that i see how they fit,2
the product is nice but the size is more a small or medium not an xl i have ever seen,0
i absolutely love these boots they can be worn with the cuff up or turned down they have great traction and keep my feet warm and at a great price too,2
they are perfect for my cartilage piercing,2
i normally wear a small and size 4 this dress is perfect and i have received many compliments i will be ordering it in black,2
just cheap socks real slippery when you put your foot in your shoe with these on really thin material wish i wouldve ordered them waist of money,0
wasnt as large as i expected,1
i am so pleased with these i ordered more great quality soft and awesome designs on a budget,2
watch and band are ok the band strap oring holds extra band has elastic which stretches too easilybr br the set up is a nightmare it is impossible to remember hot to change timebr illumination is ok but button hard to find in the darkbr watch is great for keeping timebr no other features of the watch i can use because i do not want to take time to figure them out it is not intuitive,1
these bras are pretty supportive of my 38d self the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because the pads fall out in the washer didnt realize they even had pads when i ordered them and the covering that makes it easier to put the pads back in seems to come off pretty easily,2
thats what this shirt feels like the quality of the material is awful the ruffled and polka dots are cute but the material makes it bad the longer i have it on the more i dislike it its not proportional its too tight across the chest and too big around the stomach and too big above my breast thats why im the photo of the model wearing this shirt shes holding up one arm to lift the sagging materialbr im afraid im going to be embarrassed once im out wearing this around people because they will notice how cheap it is i guess the marketing industry makes a batch of these things sells the heck out of it then discontinues it i no longer want this shirt if its free its going back returning now i have to drive out of my way to take it back so upset,0
great bead for the price,2
im a big guy and it fit around me a lot of space but not too bulky took it to disneyland fit all i needed inside of it,2
medium more like extra small,0
i havent worn the earrings and one of them is broken already,0
fights cell phone and light weight quality is what i expected,2
great boots look just like the picture these boots fit as expected i recommend waterproofing them since the material will not hold if they get wet it will create water marks thus ruining the boot,2
i had high hopes for these sneakers but they are to stiff in the toe area if you already made a decision to buy ugly shoes like these in order to have comfort then you expect them to be 100 comfortable right sorry but these sneakers do not offer comfort at all returned,0
fit to size very light great design and color wanted,2
thought it would hold more i guess i have to get a bigger one,1
ripped at the waist seam upon opening quality is lacking and dress does not look like image,0
this is a nice enough wallet and nothing really wrong with it but after reviewing a couple wallets lately i realize this really isnt my favorite setup i dont like the dividing pocket that increases the thickness and although its not extra roomy its a little taller and wider than i need it to be i also dont think it will have great longevity totally fine just not my favorite,1
these are very attractive on the outside and on the foot but they were just too small ended up returning them,0
these are really comfortable socksgreat price,2
still too big for my son he is 6 years old we tighten to the tightest setting and still too big for him,1
not as advertised they are not polarizedmirrored otherwise first impressions on the quality and packaging is top notch especially for this price point its just in terrible taste that they were advertised as polarized thats why i bought them i purchased 3 colors the blue ones were polarized0,0
i was electing more out of this because in the review pictures people posted it looked nice it really isnt super see through and crappy materiel dont trust it,0
love them however they are too heavy for me,1
