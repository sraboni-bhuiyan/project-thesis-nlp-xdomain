perfect double bill for the horribly corny beverly hillbillies is this equally atrocious lame brained comedy son in law country girl rebecca goes to wild california to attend college only to be assaulted by the lifestyle resident adviser crawl helps her settle in and soon the two are good friends bec decides to bring the wacky crawl home for thanksgiving with obvious fish out of water resultsbr br the only other comic angle steve rash aptly named achieves here is a sexual one this he bludgeons us with but to no avail both comic aspects fail dismally and you know the film is groping when crawl hijacks the combine harvester and writes his name in the corn fieldbr br dramatically the movie falls short too with several attempts at family and personal counselling from crawl misfiring between them pauly shore and carla gugino manage to raise a couple of smiles but little else while the rest of the cast are mere fodder the problem is its nearly impossible to actually like crawl and youll find yourself spending the whole flick wondering why rebecca would want to spend a moment with him however if youre a fan of unintelligent comedy son in law is right on the markbr br sunday november 10 1996 tv,0
there seems to be little in the way of middle ground where watch on the rhine is concerned one either likes it very much applauding its sincerity its liberal point of view and fine acting or else loathes its obvious propaganda mediocre dialogue cardboard characters and overall tendentiousness i fall very much in the latter category and found the film and playconcerning the activities of european refugees in washington during wartimea crushing bore worthwhile mostly for the acting and even then only intermittently that author lillian hellman was on the side of the angels is irrelevant her plays were written for people who shared her point of view and she seldom explored ideas that werent already held by the author and audience except to point out how dreadful the other side is even when i find myself in one hundred percent agreement with what she has to sayas in rhinei still cant stand the way she says it her characters are unreal and while her ear for dialogue shows a certain facility for the way people talk she possesses no real brilliance or originality she really had nothing new to say i thoroughly agree with the late mary mccarthys long overdue dismantling of hellman reputation some years ago for those who think the theatre is dead or in extremis and yearn for the good old days i urge a peek at watch on the rhine as bad in its way as angels in america which only goes to show that the theatre had one foot in the grave sixty years ago,0
before i start i need to inform you that i love horror films with a passion love them i have seen thousands and rarely does one come along that i do not like i am very forgiving of the horror genre one of the greatest lines in movie history is in the film ed wood where ed wood johnny depp freaks out and yells at the overly critical producers after they comment on plan 9s cheap sets and continuity problems you dont know anything havent you ever heard of suspension of disbelief well i try to bring that suspension of disbelief philosophy with me to every horror film i see and it usually works unfortunately it didnt work for me during the screening of cheerleader massacrebr br strike onebr br the first thing youll notice about this film is that it is shot on video and has that crummy handheldhomedigitalcamera style the camera work and quality are so bad it makes daytime soaps look breathtaking in comparison in fact it makes troma and full moon video releases look good and thats badbr br strike twobr br jim wynorski this filmmaker probably fancies himself a chip off the ol corman but nothing could be further from the truth roger corman shot fast furious and under budget but was able to deliver a tight original film though wynorski delivers a cheap film he cheats his viewers and perhaps other artists as he steals entire pieces of james horners humanoids from the deep and battle beyond the stars musical scores and inappropriately drops them into cheerleader massacre on the back of the box art and during the beginning credits the music score is falsely attributed to dan savio an extra in wynorskis deathstalker ii you will also notice how cheerleader massacre jumps from video to film and back again as wynorski lifts entire scenes from both slumber party massacre and humanoids from the deep wynorski utilized this deception fourteen years earlier in his horrible version of not of this earthbr br strike three youre outbr br while cheerleader massacre does have some nudity 40yearolds playing teenagers and the grossest set of fake breasts that i have ever seen in a horror film ugh the murders are relatively bloodless what the heck is that all about the film is titled cheerleader massacre but a handful of offscreen killings in my opinion does not add up to a massacre it doesnt even add up to a bad mosquito bitebr br the films story is fair enough unseen killer stalks a vanload of cheerleaders old gals playing teens until the van runs out of gas and the girls are forced to hold up in secluded twostory mountain home i wont ruin the ending for you but this is one of those films where the person who is obviously the killer is not obviously the killer cheerleader massacre would have been great if it were shot on film directed by joseph zito and had special effects by tom savini instead it is an effectless shotonvideo travesty by jim wynorski,0
this movie is a bad memory from my childhood this is one of those movies that they show kids on a rainy day at school when you cant go out for recess and youd rather be watching anything anything else at least thats what it was like when i was in elementary school i just remember hating this movie granted i havent seen it in 15 years or so and they probably dont use it on rainy days anymore but i just want to warn everyone youd be better off using this to put your kids to sleep than entertaining them trust me pick anything else even though the topic is kind of controversial the plot is so tame and slow that i cant remember anything about it except that i disliked it so strongly that here 15 years later i felt the need to warn all of you against it,0
i enjoyed the innocence of this film and how the characters had to deal with the reality of having a powerful animal in their midst the gorilla looks just terrific and the eyes were especially lifelike its even a little scary at times and should have children slightly frightened without going over the top rene russo plays her role wonderfully feminine usually these type of hollywood films that take place in the past feel the need to create a strawman villain but the only adversary is the gorilla its an interesting look at how close some animals are to humans how they feel the same emotions we do and yet how we really cant treat them just like people because they arent not many films venture into this territory and its worth seeing if you want to contemplate the humananimal similarity,1
the underground comedy movie is perhaps one of the worst comedies ive ever seen i should have known it was going to be bad when the box had the phrase guaranteed to offend written on it meaning that the filmmakers were going to focus more on grossing you out than making you laughbr br this movie is an amateurish jumble of childish skits bad characters and worse jokes from the pathetic batman sketch to the painfully unfunny arnold shvollenpecker skit they just arent funny the few skits that are a little funny are few and far between watching micheal clark duncan play a gay virgin for example but even they go on too long and get ruined from vince offers ineptness at comedybr br keep the underground comedy movie underground bury it,0
i still remember when frog baseball first aired on mtv in some sort of odd surreal manner the cartoon captured the stupid actions that i think every boy growing up in america engages in i cringe now thinking about how i burned a crippled grasshopper using a magnifying glass but it was interesting at the time for some reason growing up in the 1980s we all knew stoners these were the kids who wore iron maiden tshirts to school grew their hair long had immature moustaches and were at least two inches taller than everyone else because they had flunked a grade or two we laughed at them because they were so stupid even when not stoned so it was easy to understand beavis co because we already knew them some of us were even them to the extent that genxers like myself would spurn the excess of the 1980s and embrace the grunge movement of the 1990s beavis co were sort of a strange postmodern anthem for us strange because like beavis co we didnt care if we had an anthem it was just an inside joke that we all immediately got even if it was awful,0
set in paris in the year 1910 a retired old rich opera singer decides to give her fortune away to her beautiful cat duchess voiced by eva gabor and her kittens but the jealous butler edgar comes up with a plan as he kidnaps the cats and leaves them in the countryside luckily for them with the help of a streetwise and independent tomcat named thomas omalley voiced by phil harris helps them get home especially meeting some of his good friends like the swinging scat cat voiced by scatman crothers and try to foil edgars plansbr br very entertaining and edgy postwalt disneys death animated movie with a couple of nice jazzy tunes like the memorable everybody wants to be a cat good voice acting and some terrific animation for its time even in these times of computer animation not one of the greatest disney animated movies but a cult disney animated fave and one of the few gems of its day that works well highly recommended,1
shinobi is one of those movies that thinks the mere act of killing off a character automatically brings a sense of gravitas or emotion to the story unfortunately for the audience to actually care about the people dying you have to develop the characters otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence the problem is especially compounded when you have tons of characters all of whom diebr br ok so if you cant be bothered to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way you can at least make the reasons for why they die plausible right nope here we have a war between two ninja clans with neither side really knowing why they are fighting each other they kill each other because the emperor says so yet even well after it becomes glaringly obvious that the emperor wants all of them dead they still refuse to abandon their meaningless missions thats not stubbornness thats just plain dumbbr br fine fine there is no character development and the plot provides no reasonable rationale for fighting at least they die fighting in cool action scenes right yet again no in fact many of the fights arent even fights at all super ninjas that the movie spent so much time and effort introducing die suddenly and lamely in my opinion im talking about things like lalala im walking along and i neck gets slashed the end for that character not even halfway through the film i threw my hands up in frustration at the ludicrousness of it,0
this is a very strange hk film in many ways first many of the action sequences really arent that much fun the very first gun battle the occurs in the film was just silly not cool silly or even funny silly but just silly thats not to say there arent some great action scenes but most simply dont come up to the level of some of the other films i have seen the opposite side is that this film actually has characters not just people all of the main characters are interesting except for the head bad guy who is flat as a billiard table and most are fairly well acted all the protagonists in this film are just fun to watch the dialogue is quite witty and doesnt seem to lose much in translation this film is worth seeing but i hope that uninitiated american audiences dont think this is the best hk has to offer,1
i love movies that take you into them a movie that actually leaves you feeling weak when its over and this kind of movie is rarebr br damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen this movie has a cutting edge to it a main stream cast for such a low budget why is it that a man with this much talent and charisma not to mention sex appeal in ways beyond most other actors can do this with so little money to work with these actors really believe in his script and raw talent as a director writer and actor i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him damian i have heard of you through so many different circles and do not let the jealous people of this world get to you martin gets this fellini got it and you will always get it the fire and passion in you is what we love to watch on screen thankyou for being different and having the guts to write like you do you are a one of a kind director do not listen to the empty vessels,1
the movie the cave has got to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen there was no plot no storyline and the lighting was terrible for most of the movie i was unable to make sense of the scenery as it was being highlighted by flashlights the persistent grey spaces throughout the movie were irksome the only scene that really came through clearly was in the cavern lit by what appeared to be a bad simulation of the conditions to be found in hell all in all the movie was not really worth watching if the producers cannot come up with something better than this they should find another occupation the underwater scenes were particularly awful being mostly made up of bubbles and flashlights with the occasional look at the actors in summation a really awful movie with bad lighting extraneous flashes throughout,0
we loved the movie i am a mother to two little men i love having a movie i can watch with them where men have integrity and character moveis where money is not the most important thing and familys are forever and love means more then words br br i do wish we saw more of the davis family but over all i loved it left me with the same feeling the others did please dont be over we both wish actors would not changethe new actors were good replacement thobr br my 9 year old son loved this movie too asked me to go buy them all he is a movie critic so for him to say this tells me something family should all see this move buy it for friends help bring back a time of values we will be reading the books now that we are hooked really hope to see more be blessed happy moving,1
in this glorious telling of a weekend shared among literary greats mary and percy shellylord byron and others created a entrancing group showing their quests for sexual enlightenment personal freedoms from political to moral liberal drug use for both stimulations and as addiction their creative views of life and writing describing without boring the viewer how each writer seeks to find their muse along with the distractions and affections each share with breathtaking scenery that does not detract but very much enhances the story well created characters from grim to loving then angry to peaceful with some of the most lovely and scene enhancing costuming to be had,1
it is unsettling seeing so many people giving outrageously high ratings to this film some of the praise uses such twisted reasoning and transparent agendas that betray a simple love of anything that is in any way critical of the us that it approaches hysteriabr br heavens gate is a bad movie it is fundamentally awful endless scenes using elaborate shots that serve no purpose muddy dialogue murky narative no sense of any theme aside from excessbr br the high rating of this disaster is a product of revisionist history and temporary shifts in perceptionbr br for some perspective watch lawrence of arabia before watching heavens gate you will see just how aimless and lost this film truly is the issues it may have been trying to deal with are lost in a miasmabr br i have no problem with films that are critical of the us per se but when a terrible film gets such undeserved praise purely because of that element thats worth challengingbr br the film is worth seeing for two reasons curiosity and as a cautionary tale for young filmmakersbr br i saw this at home for free imagine the torture of being in a theater and sitting through it for 4 meandering hours,0
i watch a lot of vampire movies i know vampire movies hammer films have always been my favorites christopher lee will always be the best dracula br br vampire effect is a fun movie from the beginning to the end the dubbing is not great but i also like godzilla movies so i am used to badly dubbed movies anyway i liked this movie very much the sfx are great even though jackie chans part in the movie has nothing to do with the plot and seems to be added to sell the movie he is enjoyable in it the fang work is excellent the acting is not great but this could have something to do with the bad dubbing maybe the actual language would sound better with the movie if i could understand it i am sure the movie gone with the wind sounds worse in another languagebr br i own this on dvd and would not part with i have it sitting on my bookshelf next to my hammer films dvds,1
clichéridden story of an impending divorce or is it through the eyes of a 6 yearold child corny dialogue cardboard characters stock situations a red herring zombie subplot and worst of all absolutely no payoff either emotionally or dramaticallybr br does noone teach creative writing any more the true sign of a weak storyteller when you cannot create any kind of satisfying denouement just end the story im compelled to ask what made you think this was a story worth telling in the first place br br good but wasted debut by child actor anthony de marco the rest of the cast was at best forgettable and they wonder why noone watches indie films this is ninety minutes of my life i will never get back,0
a friend of mine once rented this thinking since peter fonda starred in it it couldnt be bad wrong its bad as anything can be there is so much to laugh at and its not the jokes for instance in one scene hawken walks into the forest and when he comes out he is suddenly wearing a completely different outfit where was the directors brain when he shot that scene probably the same place fondas was when he agreed to do this flick its truly a shame one has to see such a fine actor go dumb in this poor excuse for a filmbr br nobodys performance in this movie can be called acting jack elam is brought in just to bring up the star count here but all he does is looking startled in a very dark and awfully shot scene in some kind of bar not to mention the indians the girl was so godawful i wanted to shoot her just to end her misery and mine as well if i could give this a 0 i would shame that mark doesnt exist here this truly reminds of a bad joke or an amateur footage made just for fun this should serve as a proof of how bad bmovies can get,0
return to me is a charming gem of a movie with an absolutely star studded cast who can go wrong with this modern day fairy tale it also includes many many jokes written by the funny girl herself bonnie hunt who wrote and directed this film david duchovny is also very good showing a different approach then from his everday alterego mulder on my favourite show the xfiles a great date movie,1
youre in the navy now is painfully bad very likely the worst movie gary cooper ever made its supposedly based on a true story but the incident which inspired this film doesnt seem to have enough plot to sustain a featurelength scriptbr br i saw this movie on local television while i was housesitting for my motherinlaw in long island new york there was a raging blizzard outside and i was literally snowbound if id been able to get out the door i definitely would have stopped watching this moviebr br there are some interesting names in the supporting cast notably charles bronson under his original name lee marvin harvey lembeck jack webb and jack warden forget it everybody stinks in this movie even the usually reliable millard mitchell is awful lee marvin and jack warden are onscreen so briefly theres no point in your watching for thembr br gary cooper plays an obscure naval officer who is assigned to command a ship which is powered by a new experimental steam turbine basically the whole ship is a giant teakettle cooper realises that the assignment is not a prestigious one if it were it would have gone to a better officerbr br cooper was a good actor in dramatic roles but he simply had no ability for comedy he made several bad comedies and this one is his worst jane greer has always bored me and she bored me more than usual here this ship went down with all hands and sank without a trace have i mentioned that this movie stinks ill rate youre in the navy now one point out of 10 toot toot,0
modern viewers know this little film primarily as the model for the remake the money pit older viewers today watch it with wisps of nostalgia cary grant myrna loy and melvyn douglas were all superstars in an easier less complicated era or was it time of course has a way of modifying perspectives and with so many films today verily ulcerating with social and political commentary there is a natural curiosity to wonder about controversy in older seemingly less provocative films in mr blandings builds his dream house there may therefore be more than what audiences were looking for in 1948 there is political commentary however subtle finding a house in the late 40s was a truly exasperating experience only lightly softened by the coming of levittowns and the like politics in the movie the blandings children always seem to be talking about progressive ideas being taught to them in school which in real life would get teachers accused of communism in real life too myrna loy was a housing activist a democrat and a feminist melvyn douglas was no less a democratic firebrand he was married to congresswoman helen gahagan douglas whom young richard nixon accused of being soft on communism and which ruined her jason robards sr has a small role in the film but his political activism was no less noticeable more importantly his son jason robards jr would be for many years a very active liberal democrat almost the odd fellow out was cary grant whose strident conservatism reflected a majority political sentiment in hollywood that was already slipping but this was 1948 communism was a real perceived threat and the blacklist was just around the corner it would be another decade before political activism would reappear in mainstream films and then not so subtly,1
contains spoiler with the possible exception of john wayne no other actor sat taller in the saddle in westerns than james stewart and this movie proves it this superb tale of revenge centered around a winchester riflehas only one weak spot i can think of the casting of will geer as a very unearplike wyatt earp the casting of the villains was goodstephen mcnally as surly dutch henrydan duryea as waco johnny dean and john mcintireversatile at playing both good guys and bad guys as a slick gun runner the showdown between stewart and mcnally on the cliffs is great id stack this western against the whole crop of westerns made today they wouldnt stand a chance,1
this is a great film for pure entertainment nothing more and nothing less its enjoyable and a vaguely feelgood moviebr br a minor but nonetheless irritating thing about the movie is that we dont know why justine and chas broke up okay most first relationships dont work for one reason or another but they more or less seemed like a nice couplebr br in a nutshell its worth a watch to escape reality,1
okay first i should say that i assume this was just made by a group of friends with a limited budget with that in mind it really shouldnt be compared to blockbuster features and my rating would be higher but stillbr br after giving it a chance it still violated some basic filmmaking rules to such an extent that both the viewer and the amateur director in me cringed a lotbr br think blair witch in a car but really boringbr br think you left your camcorder on the dashboard and recorded yourself getting lost in the park at night for an hour then making your friends watch itbr br the scariest part possible spoiler alert if spoiling here is possible was at one point the picture rewinds and you might think you will have to watch it all over again scarybr br silliness aside this is a pretty good idea for a lowbudget letsgomakeamovietonight film but the concept walks a fine line between being really good and really bad and lets just say it wasnt really good there were just too many parts where nothing happened at first i thought that was the directors plan you were supposed to be lulled into a sense of security and then really scary things would start happening butnobr br i kept trying to find good things to say about it and i had plenty of time to think and ill say the music was kinda cool and i have to give the female lead credit for standing around by herself looking scared for a really really long time but thats it the actors playing infected people looked as if they were making fun of zombie movies or they got their motivation from the bug wearing his edgar suit from mib chances are if for some strange reason youre going to watch this movie its on dvd or tivo so you can fast forward it whenever waiting for something to happen gets too difficultbr br i hate to be so critical of something but at the same time ive watched a lot of similar movies and nothing has ever been this painful if they just chopped a half an hour out of it and added some scary stuff it might be decent maybe thatll be the directors cut,0
i just saw this movie for the first time ever and i liked it her dancing was very entertaining i read somewhere that she got the part in this movie because she knew how to dance the scenery was great too yvonne is such a talented woman and beautiful we laughed at the silly kissing scenes but that is what is great about old movies i grew up with her on the munsters and i am enjoying watching her in her earlier movies they may not all be the best out there but still worth watching to see her act and sing i am slowly purchasing all her movies and watching them as i receive them i have a large collection of her memorabilia,1
let me first just say that in the past i have been a huge carlin fan i think george is one of the smartest people and best comedians on the planet what made george so great in the past was his ability to look at things in his own twisted way and give us his unique perspective on those things it wasnt always meant to be funny but you always respected his opinions because they were presented in such a clever way but you are all diseased is just a long rant he doesnt give us any unique perspective on anything he just gives us a long list of stuff that hes pod at there is no insight no cleverness just an old man complaining for one hour straight about things that we have all complained about and on top of that it wasnt even funny you are all diseased appeals to dumb people who cant handle anything more advanced than something simple and direct i dont mind anger fueled comedy but george could have done so much better i really hope that george carlins next show will live up to the quality that george has shown in the past,0
the movie is truly poignant unique and uplifting the story is universal in that its a battle between good evil and the world between the most important thing is that its rating is wrong misleading and a travesty blockbuster has it rated as though it were an x rated movie the truth is is that it is closer to g than pg and should be seen by children who can read the clear and simple subtitles,1
though id heard that cama de gato was the worst brazilian movie of the decade i watched it giving it a chance after all firsttime directorproducerwriter alexandre stockler managed to make his debut feature shot in video for just us 4000 and though it looks even cheaper i cant begin to imagine all he went through to finally get it exhibited in theaters with no big sponsors or production companies behind it then as i watched it i realized why but whatever chances youre ready to give to cama de gato they shrink to zero within 10 minutes its an unbelievably preposterous verbose ideologically fanatical and technically catastrophic attempt to portray brazilian uppermiddle class youth as a bunch of spoiled neonazis hooked on bad sex drugs and violence and theyre made to look like closeted gays too made with no visible trace of talent imagination expertise or notion of structure visually and aurally it recalls the worst amateur stuff you can find on youtube only here it lasts ninety two countem minutes of unrelenting hysteria and clumsiness and its not even funnybadbr br weve all seen the story before bored young guys want to have fun go partying take drugs and everything goes wrong theres gangrape spanking murder the accidental death falling down the staircase of the mother of one of the boys culminating with the boys deciding to burn the corpses of the girl and the mother in a garbage landfill moral and literal garbage get it the film is heavily influenced by larry clark especially kids and bully but clarks films though also moralist and sexploitative are highclass masterworks compared to this crapbr br i dont think there was ever such monomaniacal drive in a filmmaker to stick his ideas down the audiences throat stockler grabs us by the collar and tries to force his nonstop moralist rant into our brains by repetition and exhaustion you do get numbminded with so much babbling yelling inept direction shaky camera and terrible acting going on stockler doesnt care a bit about technique the quality of the images framing sound recording soundtrack songs dialog sets editing etc is uniformly appalling but hes a narcissistic controlfreak he anticipates the criticisms hes bound to get by adding subtitles with smartiecutie comments and by making the protagonists comment at one point how farfetched and phony it all is i could relate to that br br despite his megalomaniac ambitions stockler seems incapable of giving us a minimum of visual or narrative structure he cant even decide if he wants gritty realism handheld video camera etc or stylization repetition of scenes use of alternate takes etc damn he cant even decide where to put his camera theres use of subjective camera for the three leads the dialog features some of the most stupefyingly banal verbosity ever the plot exists simply to justify the directors profound hatred for his characters and what they stand for all you see is a filmmaker being hateful preachy condemning moralizing without the benefit of a minimum of talent or technique to go,0

this film is superb wesley snipes plays blade the vampire hunter with pure class he kicks butt in such a fluid and violent way that would make bruce lee proud the movie is a fast paced thrill ride of action and superb stunts the first action scene and last are outstanding and wesley looks like a terminator as he runs around wiping out all suck heads the script is pretty good and there is sharp dialogue too wesley should have done more action films than he has i know he is a very good actor and in this he is not streched as much as in his more comic or drama roles but as far as action stars go he is the best actor of them all only bruce willis stallone and perhaps tom cruise if he counts as an action star come close also aswell as wesley being quality steven dorff is also very good as the bad guy it was an unexpected surprise that someone of small stature compared to snipes should come across as menacing but he does overall the film is sharp stylish and i hope the sequal is done with the same sort of pace,1
animated shorts just dont get much better than this wonderful canadian film this short feature is dripping with canadian references and so this film will probably be appreciated by canadians most of all but the basic story is universal and it is told lovingly by writer roch carrier it is a hilarious story that i have known for quite sometime and i was recently fortunate enough to see it again so i simply had to write a hearty recommendation for it this is a masterpiece and a mustsee whether or not you are canadian,1
death camp opera right here right nowbr br ten years ago i read that a very special movie had been directed about the polarization of our society a certain peter watkins was the author his picture was acted by some nonprofessional actors citizens like you and me and others the violence of the atmosphere was described as extremely realistic was it a movie a documentary both actuallybr br over the years i realized how hard it was to find it maybe i would by coincidence anyway its yet an old story i saw it a short while ago totally impressing my very favourite peace of art punishment park is its name i love this docufiction this truecastmovie this realityshowfictionnal what ever after all the shock movies i saw i reach the best with this strong and intense cinematographyexperience i found a masterpiece there is enough on the net to know many things about the movie it is even to buy on dvd with additional stuff the only words i want to add is about my own experience with this film i can only trust such a sincere and engaged peace of art about people and for people those who direct act or watch a cinema which is simply a real human experience within an art adventure or the opposite br br so im not talking about all the mucs we can see on tv especially the realshityshow whom the concepts of people playing themselves are interesting but used in a stupid and perverse way in punishment park we can see some real individuals living as they are we only put them in a very specific context with a few lines to follow and we let them be what they want to be its a kind of therapy a way of individuation for those inside the movie and also for the active spectators in front of screens then to end the directors touch edits a short and sweet apocalypse movie a desperate scream a death camp opera where some folks are on the run after virulent trials punishment park is for those who want to grow see this film and have the opportunity to choose your own morality grow up and harmonize yourself with it if you can feel it if you can see it in my case punishment park is stuck in me for ever with all my love consciousness and will,1
after watching this thing then reading the summary on the back of the dvd then thinking back to actual moviei became a bit dizzy i thought maybe i fell asleep and dreamed i was a down syndrome baby waltzing through a never ending forest where people drive 11 miles an hour and stop for no purpose other then occasional tasteless lesbianism where zombies come out of nowhere and vampires who seduce pure hearted citizens on their way to save the world neither zombie nor vampire notably encounter each other the only fighting i remember was getting that walrus bonny girouxs panties off coo coo ca fat all of them maybe that was because we were watching it widescreen stretched and were too lazy to change it to its native resolution but that actually made it more entertaining in conclusion my trailing thought thesis had more continuity plot character development antagonism subject matter and acting then the entirety of this film it made bloodrayne look like citizen fing kane,0
not much to say on this one a plot you can pretty much peg in the first 10 minutes nothing overly wrong with this film very little action for an action film there was a chance to explore the characters emotions occasionally whether an action film is the right genre to do that with im still undecided sniper was one of the easiest films to watch without giving full attention to as it had little twists and a straightforward plot i was probably guilty of that so with a second watch or with undivided attention it may be betterbr br 410 but the best of my 4 out of 10s,0
i just saw this at the castro theatre in san francisco and had trouble staying awake during this incredibly repetitive unenlightening little film it is a 75 minutes film that felt like 175 minutes and has about 20 minutes of modestly engaging material its not bad in any offensive way it just repeats things that have been said many many times over and more interestingly and provocatively with only a couple of exceptions the interviews drone on and on and on making little emotional contact or context to the whole topic its more like a how to guide for something that cant be done anymore i was alive during the era but felt little connection or nostalgia for what was presented,0
what you saw in bullitt and the french connection is nothing compared to what you have here the chase goes on for nearly 15 minutes and is the best youll ever see this movie has become a classic crime drama from the heyday of 70s filmmaking its a gritty and realistic portrayal of the mean streets of new york city featuring one of the slickest wise guys ever put on screen tony lo biancos behavior in this movie is cool as ice hes ripping off his own associates and making it look like the police are responsible his childhood friend roy scheider is a street detective who becomes puzzled by the disappearances of the mobsters you can tell that lo biancos enjoying the game throughout the movie at times though the film gets dull but then right when you feel like giving up on it something big happens and it pulls you back in the score by don ellis sets the tone of the cold gray wintertime in new york city and to top it all off my man joe spinell shows up in an early role as toredano the garage manbr br score 7 out of 10 stars,1
one of the commenters is wrong this is not the only pat patterson film and he didnt die two years after this was made he shot a film called the electric chair in pineville nc he shot this a few years after doctor gore patterson died in the late 70s i know this because he used my house and he left a cat there it sucked also this was a big deal when the movie came out no independent horror films were being made in nc this movie didnt help matters patterson used to do gore effects for h g lewis he was also good at magic his gore scenes in body shop were actually well done the film was shot in a building that also housed a 711 you can actually see the tops of the walls in some scenes the budget was less that 20000 and the script looked like a child wrote it only patterson could understand it stillits entertainment and its a classic,0
this is an enjoyable project that is not a film as the title suggests good performance by nadia dajani who reenacts the role of grace i follows the reenactment of what happens to mike and grace in new york city she leaves but he wants to get in contact with her this project is his way of trying to getting in touch with herbr br i saw it on ifc i have heard that it will be released on dvd as well i do like this trend of more independent projects this is an example of a good projectbr br i hope that he finds herbr br take a look and be entertainedbr br kirbyef,1
this movie is certainly wellconstructed beginning and ending in the dark with focus on lili smith schmidt julie andrewsinitially the singing angel later the notorious spybr br its beautiful i saw the movie about 15 years ago and watched it again recently while it was dismissed by critics in the 70s as overblown cinema vulgaris and lacking in structure among others time has proven them wrong blake edwards certainly has produced a film that is almost of lyrical qualitybr br the film soars and swirls aerial photography julie andrews in motion and captivates one must just buy into the premise that julie andrews is a spy whose mission has gone wrong overlooking the tepid chemistry between julie andrews and rock hudson one must believe that these are lovers who in all innocence fall for each other and in the end love is far more important than winning wars and so is maintaining innocencebr br there is a lot of understated acting and the film certainly reaches emotional depths often not seen in comediesbr br there are wonderful comedic elements foreshadowing the french goons in victorvictoria interesting diplomatic asides reminding me of the tamarind seed seen about 18 years ago and a general sense of goodwillbr br suspend all disbelief and this movie will carry you away julie andrews belting out of war songs and the haunting whistling away the dark are reason enough to turn the tv on just for the soundtrack and the striptease number like the jenny number in star works br br this film has like a good champagne aged well paramount should bring it to dvd as soon as possible the same applies to transferring the laser disk of star to dvd these are both interesting pieces of julie andrews meticulous and then underrated works,1

spoilersbr br i hate this one but it is better than the others after this they just keep getting worse i hope gibson has the smarts to stay out of the next one a lot of the same with humor ie the toilet kids etc how much farther can we watch their relationship evolve drugs bad guys why south africa i found that unbelievable maybe south american some country in the golden triangle would have made the script better it seems the late 80 early 90s had the blond bad guys ie die hard the mighty ducks play ice land gary busey in the last weapon etc hollywood repeats itself over this one with a similar story has to go over the top the attacking the police the beach condo scene and the fight at the end and way over the top gibsons girlfriend killed by the copper attack were too much like many part 2s they get worse and 3 or 4 in this series picks up speed downhill 310,0
i remember seeing this film years ago on i think bbc2 i would very much like to view it again does anyone know how i can obtain a copy as i remember it was an especially powerful movie in particular the scene that stands out is of the horses wearing gas masks apart from that i really cant recall too much about the story which is why i want to view it again i have trawled the web but am unable to find a copy which is unusual in my experience perhaps there is no dvd or vhs of this film on the market would appreciate any help anyone can give me on this thanks very much in advance for your assistance best regards albany234googlemailcom,1
i dont understand why so many of the comments here seem to indicate that this is acceptable entertainment the eyepopping horror of this cinematic monstrosity cannot be overstated me and my girlfriend just watched it together and im not sure well ever be able to have sex again im not sure what was worse the scrawny unattractive cast their supremely unphotogenic genitals the rancid attempts at humor the screeching noises that claimed to be songsbr br no i know what was worst of all the girls in the green leotards with green facepaint licking alice to dry her off then proposing in broken childlike speech that they suckle milk from her breasts that was the worstbr br also what was with the nurses and why do they seem to have so much trouble finding each others vaginas why are all the male actors gay why does humpty dumpty waggle a dildo in the air and pretend that its his penis why did my eyes have to see this there are no words,0
wow here it finally is the action movie without action in a real lowbudget setting dont miss the hilarious flying saucers flying by a few times of a future seattle we find a nobrain hardbody seeking to avenge her childhoodbr br there is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors performance is only rivalled in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies mainly matrix without having the money to do it right yes we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shootouts 45 secs approx but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbodys attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and thenbr br and yes we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere as if the script was thoughtout by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenesbr br believe me it is as bad as it possibly can get in fact it doesnt deserve to be taken seriously but perhaps i can make some of you not rent it and save your money,0
the version i saw of this film was the blockbuster rental with a similar title but a swear word in itbr br this film was funny as hell it was also true to the bone if you have ever spent time in hollywood or the area around it you will understand the humor if not you may not get it at allbr br the story of two people in the business struggling to make it until they finally reach a breaking point it is a rare gem it states it is a drama but it is a drama as much as deer hunter is a comedybr br loren dean is wonderful as always as a supporting actor jamie kennedy was able to hold his own well his performance is especically impressive during the poodle scene the only downside was carmen electra but we cant have everything,1
id never heard of this film before i caught it on the telly last night i do hope it was never given a cinema release as this would be an insult to the silver screen and moviegoers alikebr br was it supposed to be serious was it supposed to be funny why the outrageously basic plot does anyone actually carebr br awful filmbr br 210,0
a really funny story idea with good actors but it misses somehow the actors are older but none of them looked particularly good they needed better make upphotography or somethingit is supposed to be a love story and yet the film had more of the rough look of a street film i liked the cast but i think the performances were rather bland this is where the weakness of the director shows perhaps if mrs spielberg had mr spielberg directing it would have been a much better film,0
david aames is a rich goodlooking guy who lives in new york city when his sleeping partner julie gianni gets very jealous after david falls for spanish beauty sofia she gets david into her car and tells him that hes the only guy she loves and wants to be with but seeing as hes in love with sofia she decides to commit suicide with david in the car with her by driving off a bridge david survives the crash but is left with a disfigured face he is then charged with the murder of julie the thing is david doesnt know whats real and whats not as he keeps having these strange dreams most of which are actually nightmares and flashbacks some of which just dont make sense to him everything will soon come back to him though as hes begins to find out the truthbr br well theres an all star cast here including tom cruise penélope cruz cameron diaz kurt russell jason lee and noah taylor who all give good performances in the movie in the movie they all put off different things about there characters like happiness sadness angry etc really well theres also a cameo in the movie from the brilliant steven spielbergbr br vanilla sky is a well made different interesting and original movie which will leave you talking about it a lot after its finished its not just a thriller but its a real psychological thriller the trailer for the movie is really good but the movie is so different from what it might be made out to be its been directed very well and there were a couple of really great scenes here too all in all an enjoyable movie which should be really be paid attention too they are sure making a lot of are they dead if not who is dead movies recently,1
i recommend that movie viewers if in the new york city area go to the intrepid museum and get some idea of how closed in and cramped the living was for the crews of world war ii vintage submarines how much more so that must have been for the seamen during world war i it must have truly been hell belowbr br walter huston and robert montgomery head the cast of hell below huston as the by the book captain and montgomery as his free wheeling number two theyre both quite believable as naval officers and the rest of the cast like robert young eugene palette jimmy durante madge evans sterling holloway etc fill their roles quite nicelybr br the silent service got more popular during world war ii and after its amazing but i could name a whole slew of submarine pictures like torpedo run operation pacific hellcats of the navy run silent run deep and many more and youll see the same plot situations in all of them i guess there truly is a limit on situations as wellbr br jimmy durantes performance is interesting hes pretty funny and his scene with the boxing kangaroo while on shore leave is very funny indeed but id have to say a character like him in those cramped quarters is probably very necessary for morale if you dont have someone like that to break the tension on board a submarine you ought to get one transferred to your ship immediatelybr br the highlight for me however is sterling holloways death scene very similar to sean mcclorys in island in the sky it will haunt you long after youve seen this film,1
plants in an ancient mayan pyramid structure killing all who come close yes it is weird as the travelers do not figure it out until everything starts doing crazy and in a movie like this i just wished it went absurd and had marching bands being attacked by plants wielding machetesbr br anyway a group of people from america vacation and go into the mountains with a couple of other newly made german friends who know about the place when they get there mayans began shouting at them and hide on the structure and when there thats when the plants decide to take them out mimicking cell phone noises humans and ancient mayan dead peoplebr br nothing was really scary about the movie and was not even entertaining not even the weird ending could save this piece of crap i kept looking for something really good to happen but nothing oh well f,0
if you like whodunits you will like this film considered the best italian detective story giallo fulci has donebr br its not mickey spillane for sure there are scenes designed to disturb anyonebr br many would be offended by a local beauty trying to seduce a 12yearold boy she was joking but she was naked nonetheless and he would have jumped at the chance to jump her bones she also tries to tempt the local priestbr br young boys are turning up missing and there are several interesting suspects you have to watch carefully to discover the killer can you dont jump on the first guy its way too early and he is too obviousbr br anyone familiar with fulci will be able to guess the killer who died a violent death at the end what crazy reasoning he had,1
i really didnt expect much from this movie but it wasnt bad actually it was quite good this movie contained a couple of the funniest bits of writing i have ever seen from a motion picture now am not saying this is one of the funniest movies of all time but i laughed pretty hard at some parts the police ruled my fathers death a suicide they said he fell down an elevator shaft onto some bullets now this movie is not for everybody its mostly stupid humor like zoolander or dodgeball so if you hated these movies i would probably recommend you to steer clear overall it was an enjoyable movie about a group of superhero wannabes who end up becoming real heroes in the end its a vastly overrated comedy that many people probably havent seen yet because like me before viewing it expected it to be utter garbage after viewing this film i finally understand why this movie was able to assemble such a superstar cast which includes ben stiller william h macy hank azaria and even that kid from good burger its because mystery man is full of excellent comedic writing period 7 out of 10 a very big surprise,1
this movie is one of the funniest i have seen in years a movie which deals with death and funerals without being depressing or irreverant christopher walken provides much of the comedy in this charming romance and i could hardly breathe for laughing so hardbr br i saw the movie a preview and when it was over the audience not only applauded but cheered i am telling all my friends to watch for its arrival in the usa i definitely plan on seeing it again in the theater and purchasing it on dvd as soon as its available,1
this is a really great film it gets you thinking about your parents how we all have fragile relationships we all have with them unless we really make an effort to know who they are as people and just as important we should remember to open up and show them our real selves not just who we think they want us to be definitely see this documentary imdb is making me write more text before they will post my comment how odd usually online comments need to be short short and here i am being asked to write more well i went to see the film with my parents i thought afterward they would want to talk about their parents but my dad kept wanting to talk about himself and things in his life he feels he screwed up which was unusual my dad is not a reticent man but i was surprised that he wanted to talk about mistakes he thinks he made mike and kitty came to the film to do a q a and there was a hilarious moment afterward when my dad was talking with mike while my mom spoke with kitty really just disregard my last few sentences to pad this comment and just remember 51 birch street go see it,1
the beginning of the 90s brought many quirky and offbeat independent films a particular subgenre of which is the semispiritual desert crime movie others of note are wild at heart from dusk til dawn and to a certain extent natural born killers good films like those spawned junk like highway 666 destiny turns on the radio and this ineptly surreal antimasterpiece under the hula moon its a comedy that aims for a certain emotional tone attains it but keeps going to the point of irritation while the pursuit across the spiritworld of the desert and the casting of chris penn are good ideas the film is not dirty enough or hard enough to be a good crime movie and isnt focused enough on laughs to really be a comedy i wont blow the ending but lets just say its bad the film is basically a bad side effect of genrecancer this is the dregs of indiemania,0
tep is like a long cool drink of water after crawling across the sahara to classic film buffs who have been too long deprived of that certain cinematic magic not only is it beautifully photographed but the characters are perfectly portrayed if youre looking for the film to be a mirror of the book you will be seriously disappointed instead it is an excellent companion to the book and i think that is what anthony minghella intended ralph fiennes is probably the most beautiful man in the world not to mention a brilliant actor juliette binoche is the posterchild for vulnerability and childlike enthusiasm and of course ill go see any film in which kristin scott thomas is featured she simply must be the best actress since the likes of deborah kerr so much was promised with this film and so much is delivered,1
a couple of men are shipwrecked on a remote island they are then captured by an insane count who lives there with a small group of servants while in the castle dungeon lives the counts unfortunate leper wifebr br the dungeon of harrow is pretty much a hack job of a movie the amateur actors all sleepwalk through the film while an annoyingly insistent score continually plays in the background the various bits of action are all filmed in an incredibly unenergetic way in fact the film in general is completely lethargic it just seems to drag on and on and even though the ending isnt too bad you will be hardpressed to care by that point as an example of 60s gothic horror this is strictly a bargain basement example i sadly cant recommend this one really,0
this movie is about a side of ireland that americans dont normally see the narrowminded religiously prejudiced side of the friendliest race in the world the movie by the admission of the inhabitants of fethard who are old enough to remember the events is fairly accurate though they insist that the filmmakers invented some of the more violent scenes just to spice up the actionbr br the movie was very unpopular in ireland as it portrayed the catholic church in a bad light but the simple fact is that representatives of the catholic church did organise vetoes of minorities before protestants it was the jewsbr br the film is a fascinating insight into the whole issue of religion in ireland,1
i saw this movie once a long time ago just once and i didnt know where it had come from and i looked for about six years to find it and i finally found it here at imdbcom just the whole concept of the movie is great i believe its got something to do with a race of bioengineered beings keeping tabs on us and our planet but there is one person who keeps out of being assimilated into conformity and the way that he does itto keep himself from being tracked and located is what keeps the movie entertaining i dont remember exactly how it ended but i remember it finished with a great climax and a good twist,1
certain filmmakers can do no wrong in the eyes of national critics which is one reason you should never pay attention to them this film is a perfect example the critics like director eric rohmerbr br this movie is a boring soap opera about a woman and a teenager pauline shes taking care of for the summer and the relationships they have with a few men its talk talk talk and more talk br br for those looking at the cover and hoping to be titillated there are a few quick nude shots and a couple of swear words but otherwise this is a harmless french morality play a friend of mine loaned me this tape he thought he was getting some sexy french film and was disappointed i was just as disappointed because it also was so boring br br how this gets such great reviews is almost unfathomable,0
the film chaos takes its name from gleicks 1988 pop science explanation of chaos theory what does the book or anything related to the content of the book have to do with the plot of the movie chaos nothing the film makers seem to have skimmed the book obviously without understanding a thing about it looking for a theme to united the series of mundane action sequences that overlie the flimsy string of events that acts in place of a plot in the film in this respect the movie choas resembles the canadian effort cube in which prime numbers function as a device to mystify the audience so that the ridiculousness of the plot will not be noticed in cube a bunch of prime numbers are tossed in so that viewers will attribute their lack of understanding to lack of knowledge about primes the same approach is taken in chaos disconnected extracts from gleicks books are thrown in make the doings of the bad guy in the film seem fiendishly clever this of course is an insultingly condescending treatment of the audience and any literate viewer of chaos who can stand to sit through the entire film will end up bewildered how could a film so bad be made rewritten as a novel the story in chaos would probably not even make it past a literary agents secretarys desk how could at least hundreds of thousands and probably millions of dollars have been thrown away on what can only be considered a waste of time for everyone except those who took home money from the film regarding whats in the movie every performance is phoned in save for technical glitches it would be astonishing if more than one take was used for any one scene the story is uniformly senseless the last time i saw a story to disconnected it was the production of a literal eightyearold among other massive shortcomings are the following the bad guy leaves hints for the police to follow he has no reason whatsoever for leaving such hints police officers do not carry or use radios dupes of the bad guy have no reason to act in concert with the bad guy let me strongly recommend that no one watch this film if there is any other movie you like or even simply do not hate watch that instead,0

the intention the directors has for this films are quite honorable but his history of his productions did get me aware that this might not get much to the core like other film makers would do it keeping his great 30 days tv series in mind but also counting in his mtv production i bet you will that opposes his seriousness in any of the matters he documents and also counting in his rather disappointing production supersize me i did not had my hopes up high sadly enough this movie disappointed me none the less as with supersize me after a while i did ask myself what exactly the point of all this was the main statement gets clear enough after half an hour but the rest of the playtime gets filled with rather pointless stuff and rerepeating stuff that were already shown in this way or another earlier in the movie so it wears out and gets extremely boring towards the end,0
did beavis and butthead make this movie it is just that bad truly an uneven and unfair portrayal of bad vs good in the wine world did you notice the filmmaker trying any of the wines from the featured protectors of individual wines and terroir the camera work is dizzying at best while the content may put you to sleep before long this is not insightful journalism what i got from this movie was that the filmmaker was trying hard to make a point about the globalism of wine by showing for example that the mondavi family owned wineries in all parts of the world okay that is a good start so how do these wines compare does the mondavi napa cab taste like their italian wines we never find out because no one in the film comments on this instead there is a lot of innuendo about nazis and fascism well those things dont grow grapes hmmmm,0

this movie is lame and not funny at all the plot doesnt even make sense some scientist who works on the fringes of science opens a doorway to another dimension maybe hell and his daughter gets sucked through it or something then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and wears a skimpy outfit i guess the demons in the other dimension made it for her the main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously shes more interested in her new girlfriend and they stumble upon this witch spell book they want to be witches or something and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently there is topless scenes for no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a well known wrestler but his part is completely unnecessary obviously they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this pointless movie im sure the topless girls doesnt hurt there either the extra features on the dvd were even more confusing than the rest of the movie i thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just made things more confusing who are these people and what are they doing basically this is a gocampingtomakeoutthenfightamonster movie but there are a bunch of things like the other dimension and book seller than make it confusing i didnt like the movie but it was only like five bucks so big deal i dont recommend watching it though it was just too stupid i cant think of any part of the movie that was good,0
this movie was disaster at box office and the reason behind that is innocence of the movie sweetness of the story music was good story is very simple and old but presentation of such story is very good director tried his best abhay is excellent and impressive and he shines once again in his role he did his best in comedy or in emotional scene soha looks so sweet in the movie rest star cast was simply okay music and all songs are good himesh is impressive as an singer here dont miss this movie its a wonderful movie and a feel good one for us abhay best work till date i will give 910 to ahista ahista,1

japan takes the best from around the world and makes it their own while that may be true it applies to all except for one thing that beingmajor league baseballbut not to worry mr baseball is there to try and change all that but just who will change whom is the part of the movie that really makes it rock tom selleck is one of my favorite actors and really shineson in his comedic roles the storyline may be true to life however the subplot is deadon the japanese people are a gentle respectful people with ways and traditions very different than those of western society all of these elements and obstacles combine to make for one truly enjoyable funny film its definitely worth the watch,1
it was obvious that this movie is designed to appeal to the chick flick audience to which i have sat through quite a few and enjoyed most however this was a very irritating attempt by heather graham to become the next meg ryan who became annoying as hell in her own right her acting was overdone and it appeared that she was overanxious compared to her colleagues who were relaxed in their roles this film might have been more as there was suitable budget for settings actors and a decent story line my wife and i both agreed that this was muck at the end as the film ended on a painful embarrassing high better luck next time hope miss graham sticks to the type of films that she belongs in like from hell,0
morte a venezia is one of my favorite movies more than beautiful its really sublime it gives you important aesthetic experiences its a masterpiece i also recommend the novel luchino visconti is a genius,1
this is a really dumb movie it could be fun with the cool looking aliens and the country setting but it just isntbr br some aliens hear the broadcast of war of the worlds when a small country radio station plays it on halloween they come to earth to kill humans but instead of killing they make people their slaves and act goofy the front cover of the film shows these aliens riding surfboards in spacenot really what they do these arent party aliens they are stupid cartoonish idiots with annoying high pitched modulated voices the alien with the most tolerable voice also happens to be the jack nicholson ripoff alien who always wears his sunglasses other than the aliens the acting is terrible the writing is obviously meant for children because every character is written like a kidbr br this is a dumb movie that only children will appreciate maybebr br my rating 12 out of 100 mins pg for mild language,0
i do not fail to recognize hanekes aboveaverage filmmaking skills for example i appreciate his lingering on unremarkablenaturaldaylighted settings as a powerful way to force a strong sense of realism however regarding the content of this film i am very sad to see that in the 21st century there is still an urge to pathologize dominationsubmission relations or feelings andor bdsm practices the problem that the main character has with her mother is unbelievably topical as is the alienation and uncomprehension felt by walter i dont mean the frustration of a lover which is not loved back in the same way which is understandable i mean that he looks upon her as if she were crazy or as if he was a monk come on i mean ds is not something new in the world and i think it is rather silly to treat the subject as if it were something freakish or pathological it isnt in general films dealing with this subject are really lagging behind the timesbr br so for me i feel that this film ends up being quite a programmatical film worried with very outdated psicoanalitical theories isnt it nearly embarrassing and that does not really relate with reallife lives and experiences of those engaged in ds relationships personal experience forums irc chatrooms even recent scholar studies will show this,0
closet land tells a powerful story and has many different subtle elements you could read lots of stuff about the movies plot before hand but you dont really need to all you need to know is that the movie is all about an interrogation along the way we learn lots of things about the interrogator and the person being interrogated we also learn that the world can be a dark and scary place especially when you have absolutely no control over itbr br in the end the movie amounts to a warning really though the movie has several different aspects to it about what happens to peoples freedoms when they look the other way and ignore injustices happening to those around thembr br if youve got about an hour and a half and know where you can rent this i strongly recommend that you do so,1
this movie is just not worth your time its reliance upon newage mysticism serves as its only semiinteresting distraction the plot is one that has been recycled countless timesbr br i was only prompted to even spend the time to put in a comment when i noted that some have tried to propup the reputation of this drivel their motivation objectivity is dubious since they encourage you not to look at the movies faults but at its well intentioned message of new age consciousnessbr br so would it be alright for some twenty to thirty evangelical christians or islamic fundamentalists to pour in positive ratings about moviestelevision that support their views in spite of the poor qualities of production or the lack of truth in any of its supposed historic basis i hope notbr br i am sure the followers will come right behind me to say flowery things about this movie in spite of the truth,0
personally i think kevin spacey is one of the greatest actors of his generation maybe the greatest this in combination with another amazing actor named jeff bridges it cant be bad and thats exactly what this movie is kpax is one of the most pleasant surprises of the latest years to start with has the movie a brilliantly written story its part of what makes the movie so great the other aspect that contributes to the greatness of the movie is the acting the combination spaceybridges really worksbr br this was already the second time i saw the movie and im sure it wont be the last time kpax has everything there are moments which are extremely funny parts that remind of a true thriller and others which reminds of highclass drama i think this movie deserves a much higher rating and a lot more awards great movie br br 910,1

curiosity led me to this masterpiece unfortunately i didnt rent it i bought it the most disturbing thing about this film is that its not so disturbing for reasons known only to them the makers of this film set out to show the human side of jeffry dahmer are you kidding me the man gave new meaning to the term finger lickin good and with all the flashbacks and flashforwards i had trouble following the story all in all jeremy renners performance wasnt too bad you can catch him in swat in which he plays a disgruntled excop anyway i would rate this as a 110 it only got a 1 because of renners soso performance there are plenty of books and tv documentaries out there that do a much better job of covering dahmers crimes avoid this one,0
a friend of mine who is even more into 1970s cult films than myself recommended this one to me and in fact gave me the copy of it that i watched however i was not as enthusiastic about the result as he or for that matter michael elliott was the film is a hybrid of house of wax 1953 and the texas chain saw massacre 1974 indeed i would venture to say that it served as the basis of the 2005 remake of the former much more than the original did so we have a remote and derelict wax museum of incredibly lifelike dummies guess why that is with its apparently harmless curator a hammy chuck connors being invaded by the obligatory group of stranded teenagers among them tanya roberts he also has a mad brother shades of psycho 1960 incorporated for good measure down to the selfsame twist who is supposed to be a mechanical genius showcased in a poltergeist which unaccountably accompanies the first murder the film does benefit from a pino donaggio score but being so derivative and not especially well made to boot essentially ends up merely a redundant and fairly muddled genre effort,0

who were they kidding with this there was just too much in this film that was hard to digest right from when arjun ajay devgan unknowingly wishes death on his father to when he arrives in london with his uncleplayed by om puri only to abandon him minutes later the only problem with that theory is that anybody who has ever passed through london heathrow knows that such a fête would be impossible to pull off and especially not by an indian but the film problems do not end there theres the issue of the two main leads salman khan and ajay devgan passing as rockstars on the verge of achieving their dreams i mean yeah we saw success come to susan boyle a woman in the uk achieving her dreams after age 50 but that was a rare case it was really hard for me to suspend my disbelief because i felt that the casting of salman and ajay was just illconceived they would never cast madhuri dixit and sridevi to play the same roles so why should we be forced to watch ajay devgan and salman khan men well into their 40s prance around desperately trying to hang on to their 20s lets not even talk about the most selfconscious actress on screen today asin this is her second film that i have seen and she is just hopeless as an actress so conscious of her looks that she only concerns herself with looking good and voguing for the camera rather than giving in a good acting performance its just hard to believe that she turned down all those other movie roles to star in this fluff and then be so fluffy as an actress nothing to write home about at all and to top all of that the film just boringly dragged on theres nothing special about it at all trust me you will predict every clichéd thing that is going to happen in it,0

a very ordinary madefortv product tyson attempts to be a serious biopic while stretching the moments of angst for effect fast forwarding through the esoterics of the corrupt sport of boxing and muddling the sensationalistic stuff which is the only thing which makes tyson even remotely interesting a lukewarm watch at best which more likely to appeal to the general public than to boxing fans,0
if youre a longtime fan of the doctor and you cringed when you heard they were making another series rest easy it more than meets the high expectations of the original the pacing is much quicker than the original shows fitting more often into 50 minutes episodes rather than the average 90 minutes the writing is excellent the acting superb the hardest and best thing to get used to is the production values of the new series compared to the original its got some now although i will always have fond memories of bubblewrap and handpuppet monsters if youre not a fan or if you tried the original and couldnt get a handle on it jump in with both feet now everything you really need to know about the doctor theyll tell you as they go along this series was written with minimal references to the doctors enormous back story specifically to encourage new viewers admittedly im only seeing the first new series now as its being shown on the scifi channel in other words probably cut to ribbons for time constraints but im looking forward to future episodes either on broadcast tv or on dvd july 4th cant come soon enough,1

the name lucio fulci congers up images of graphic death and mutilation in the minds of may fans thanks to movies like zombi 2 city of the living dead the beyond and the new york ripper fulci has a reputation for being one of the goriest directors in history and although many of his later movies certainly justify his reputation until the release of zombi 2 in 1979 fulcis films did not contain anywhere near the amount of blood and guts hes know for in fact they were for the most part gore free instead relying on more traditional shocks and disturbing imagery to work dont torture a duckling hardly contains any gore yet ranks as his bestbr br dont torture a duckling is set in a small sicilian town where superstition rules instead of logic the townsfolk are very distrustful of outsiders as well as anyone different often shunning them after a series of child murders though many people descend upon the town including andrea martelli thomas milan who tries to uncover the truth about the murders while they continue to happenbr br this is a remarkable film its very well made with an excellent cast filled with many favorites of italian exploitation cinema it also contains a solid score as well as many creative camera movement courtesy or lucio fulci but the real draw of dont torture a duckling is the disturbing nature of the movie little kids around twelve years old are shown mocking retarded people visiting prostitutes and being propositioned sex by an older woman it also contains some very biting commentary on the middle class and the catholic church it is for reasons like this that dont torture a duckling was blacklisted throughout europe when it was first released and never was shown in the united states still dont torture a duckling stands as a monumental achievement in giallo cinema as well as lucio fulcis best work i really cant recommend this one enough check it out,1
as i am no fan of almost any postdesperate living john waters films i warmed to pecker after he emerged from the underground waters produced trashlite versions of his earlier works cry baby polyester hairspray that to diehard fans looked and tasted like watered down liqueur pecker which doesnt attempt to regurgitate early successes is a slight quiet humble commentary on the vagaries of celebrity and the pretentiousness of the art world waters clearly knows this subject well because he has also exhibited and sold at ridiculous prices some of the most amateurish pop art ever created that you couldnt imagine anyone being able to give away if it wasnt emblazoned with the waters name edward furlong is fine as pecker and waters nonhistrionic style is at ease with the subject,1
i must admit a slight disappointment with this film i had read a lot about how spectacular it was yet the actual futuristic sequences the age of science take up a very small amount of the film the sets and are excellent when we get to them and there are some startling images but this final sequence is lacking in too many other regardsbr br much the best drama of the piece is in the midsection and then it plays as melodrama arising from the high concept sciencefiction nature of it all and insufficiently robust dialogue there is far more human life in this part though with the great ralph richardson sailing gloriously overthetop as the small dictator the boss of the everytown i loved richardsons mannerisms and curt delivery of lines dismissing the presence and ideas of raymond masseys aloof confident visitor this boss is a posturing convincingly deluded figure unable to realise the smallfry nature of his kingdom its not a great role yet richardson makes a lot of itbr br everytown itself is presumably meant to be england or at least an english town fairly representative of england interesting was the complete avoidance of any religious side to things the things to come seem to revolve around a conflict between warlike barbarism and a a faith in science that seems to have little ultimate goal but to just go on and on there is a belated attempt to raise some arguments and tensions in the last section concerning more personal life yet one is left quite unsatisfied the film hasnt got much interest in subtle complexities it goes for barnstorming spectacle and unsubtle blunt moralism every time and of course recall the hedgedbet finale raymond massey waxing lyrical about how uncertain things are br br concerning the question of the film being a prediction i must say its not at all bad as such considering that one obviously allows that it is impossible to gets the details of life anything like right the grander conceptions have something to them a war in 1940 well that was perhaps predictable lasting nearly 30 years mind a nuclear bomb the super gun or some such contraption in 2036 a technocratic socialist we dont believe in independent nation statestype government in britain after 1970 hmmm sadly nowhere near on that one chaps no real politics are gone into here which is a shame all that surfaces is a very laudable antiwar sentiment generally it is assumed that dictatorship whether boneheadedludditefascist as under the boss or allhandstothepump scientific socialism will be the deal and these implications are not broached while we must remember that in 1936 there was no knowledge at all of how nazism and communism would turn out or even how they were turning out the lack of consideration of this seems meek beside the scope of the filmmakers vision on other mattersbr br much of the earlier stuff should and could have been cut in my opinion only the briefest stuff from 1940 would have been necessary yet this segment tends,1

two hands is an entertaining funny story about australian lowlifes the screenplay contrasts the world of fast money and deadly acts with the inexplicability of fate and circumstance in a subtle way we are asked to ponder the concept that major events in our lives are sometimes generated without our being fully aware of the root causes the forces of fate and circumstance take jimmy the main character into situations that bring about the realization of his shallow dreams and ultimately an understanding of a more personally promising worldbr br the clueless jimmy portrayed with acumen by heath ledger is a kid who grew up without opportunity the high paying world of crime offers the greatest appeal to his blunted senses the love and help of friends guides him to a higher plateaubr br the film is welldirected and wellacted the band of criminals teeter between likable and despicable keeping us interested in their crazy antics all through the film,1
this movie is a cringefest of bad acting and poor set design as well as tacky lines and a lame plot but it is so much fun to watch everything about it is hilariousthe basic plot is a group of scientists from the future travel back in time to capture their evil coworker who is intent on destroying them all they catch up with him in the year 1146 the futuristic lab of the scientists from the year 2033 is an eightiesstyle room with a bunch of futuristic flashing buttons and a time capsule that looks like a lawn shed the actors deliver their lines with unenthusiastic aplomb which isnt hard to understand considering that the lines are usually earthshakers like i doublechecked everything twice he double checked everything twice he checked it four times not only that but they feed you the entire premise of the movie in the first five minutes and continue at a rapid fire pace until they hit the medieval part when roger corman ran out of money and had to stop travelling through time and consequently different sets the medieval set is a comic mishmash of anything from the late 10th century to the 16th century any costume they could find they used i guess chain mail wasnt on the budget cause the guys all wear sequined shirts masquerading as armor the fight scenes are laughable with men casually throwing themselves onto cardboard swords with abandon and dying in death throws with nary a blow castit sounds truly awful but i enjoy it every time i watch it the lines alone are enough to have you in fits and everything else pulls together to create a fabulous bmovie that if you are a connoisseur of corny flicks i would suggest you see and once you have read the review on unknown movies i love hearing them point out all the funny truly awful bits in the movie,0
this is an excellent example of what can be done on a small budget movie the acting is excellent considering the script the whole atmosphere of the film is very foreboding the gore is well done and used sparingly look out for the excellent barbedwire death the action is punchy when used its true that there are dodgy lines in the script at times but compared to other movies on the same or bigger budget its hardly noticeable at all overall this is recommended trust me its better than it appears 810,1
what more could i say the americans totally hated it because the us cut was so bad although you could detect the underlying goodwill in itbr br talking about the us theatrical releasealong with the newly released bluray disc version its faster and tighter than hk cut the background musics were all changed from the dark grim hk musics to hiphop musics and there were a lot of gruesome scenes cut out though the dubbing was a notable job given that they tried to capture the original actors voice and tone but the problem is hak hapblack mask the movie was designed and meant to be dark grim superdisturbing and totally gruesome very unfortunately the us release just skimmed the cream they wanted which in return completely changed the movies undertonehk release was rated 18 to be even more comical and amateurishbr br now lets talk about the original hk release this movie is like a hidden gem a prototype for the whole matrix tide and era the fighting scenes are totally awesome even the camera works were a bit oldschool among hk movies however the style the movie created was a unique blend of kungfu and pop culture with all the leather black costumes and decorations this movie features a batmanlike superhero in a black mask against a runofthemill gang of multinational supersoldiers lead by a punk heavy metal rock star boss yes it sounds like imaginations of a retarded child but it works its so impressive that the whole movies gonna give you nightmares featuring foreigners fighting a bloodbath battle in leather coats in year 2002 they made a sequel which had a pg13 rating but without jet li and liu qing yun and you know how bad that was because li and liu were the core characters in the movie and had strong personalities and an interesting friendship and did i happen to mention francois yip her roundhouse kick was totally cool even cooler than the villain boss because she didnt use a stuntman for all the fighting did i mention she was also smoking hot anyway there are a lot of things to like about the moviebr br however the movie also suffered from a lot of problems first off its a mediocre script made at its best potential which means this production team deserved a better screenwriter there are a lot climaxes in the entire 100 minutes but they often felt like farfetched and dont totally make senses to the audiencesus version was even worse because all the character developments were cut anyway you cant ask too much out of a comicinspired action movie also this movie is entirely improper for children i wont recommend it to you if you are less than 20 years old its saturated with disturbing contents including blood gore sadomaso costumes extreme brutal violence and so on along with the style of the movie it can be called a wet dream for heavymetal rock music fans and action fans the us cut was milder but if you want to see it see,1
while the design and locations and photography are strong assets in this film it is a turgid and melodramatic affair which demonstrates the limits of cinema to convey truthbr br the case is the use of the soundtrack music a mix of gustav mahler and andrew lloydwebber that plays constantly and loudly and would have made max steiner grimace at its over use as it instructs the audience how difficult how ecstatic how tortured it is to be an artist and then it really counts the story elides the details at the endbr br this heightened and kitsch exploitation of emotions was once well ridiculed by peter ackroyd about a yukio mishima book this is not writing this is barbara cartland precisely the same critique can be made of this film a deceptive mawkish vanity project,0
i just watched this film 15 minutes ago and i still have no idea what i just watched mainly i think its a film about an internet sm star of cd roms that are about as realistic as flash cartoons online shes murdered by someone which causes her sister and a crack team of 2 fbi agents to investigate the death the local homicide division of big city usa is also investigating though most of his work comes by the way of oogling the cd roms which he claims are as realistic as the real thing i know wowbr br michael madsen is the only one in the film that has any kind of credits behind him hes in the film for about 15 minutes and half of that is him banging the main girl for seemingly no apparent reason i wont even explain the ending because quite frankly i cant make it out myself but before the final scene were treated to a 3 or 4 minute montage of everything in the film honestly they could have ran that then the final scene and it would have been the same effect with the cross eyed direction and allbr br all in all stay away from this film i got it because i love bad movies and i love michael madsen i really could have used that 80 some minutes on something else and have been more satisfied like playing that game with a knife where you jab at your hand repeatedly that for 80 minutes would be much more entertaining,0
nicodemus is almost a copy of red in the odd behavior sense but this episode focuses on other people in clark kents unpredictable life when a poisonous flower finds its way into smallville jonathan kent is the first to be effected by it the flower causes people to reverse their behavior and when it effects jonathan he becomes short tempered and violent however clark manages to stop him from doing anything rash until his father finally passes out okay so far so good next up is lana the episode was good up to that point for the flower causes her to attempt seducing clark at the last moment he refuses her but the damage has already been done this episode causes the wrong impressions and isnt suitable for people under the age of twenty due to its adult content the first part was good the last part focusing on the effect the flower has on pete was good but the middle that was all about lanas alternate personality was most defiantly not and that ruined what could have been a brilliant episode i give this episode two,0
dark rising is your typical bad obviously quickly produced horrorscififantasy movie it has a strange unexplained plot with holes so big you could fit an elephant through them most of the time i didnt know what the hell was going on but it didnt really matter it was a simple demon hunter returns from hell dimension to save campers story with confusing stuff added on about witches and a book of evil with plot elements and characters who make no sense or disappear totally for no reason the acting is bad but there honestly is not much they can do with this script i am guessing there is a couple topless scenes which is probably the only reason this bad movie got made like so many other bad movies give this one a pass unless there is nothing else on tv,0

from what critics and audiences indicated birthday girl had to be a big fat clinker still because i love nicole kidman i decided to rent it last night it proved to be quite worthy of watching sure it isnt your basic american comedy and it doesnt take a genius to realize that it is a very british movie but thats why i liked it it was a change from all the other movies around a breath of fresh air sure there were some plot holes but overall it worked first off kidman was fabulous again in a very different not very glamorous but still quite sexy role she just keeps proving that she is one of the top talents in hollywood not only is her russian accent when she speaks english effective but there are times when she carries on long conversations in russian and if you didnt know it was nicole kidman you would never question her authenticity harrison ford should have taken note in k19 overall a slight little movie that works despite the horrible buzz,1
personally i would advise people to stay clear of this movie its on the whole a bore to watch and the fighting is poorly choreographed slow and not very convincing if you buy the hong kong legends dvd release of this movie then the only thing worth listening to is the bey logan audio commentarybr br but in any case since when has there ever been a ninja film worth watching i cannot think of one and frankly do not wish tobr br overall when it comes to movies i have one golden rule avoid any films that contains the word ninja,0
of course how could he he obviously coopted several aspects from that excellent movie which was also based on the sensational french case of the selfdescribed doctor in the world health organization who murdered his family and himself when finally unmasked as a fraud emilio refers to his son as monster he sings to the radio in his car he hangs out on park benches and he specializes in investment schemes to defraud his family and friends all of this and more directly lifted from time out which came out the year before nobodys life its too bad because this movie is pretty good on its own with good acting and writing whereas vincent from time out is a much more subtle character who seems to have a sense of ethics even though at times it gets twisted into knots the protagonist here seems devoid of any character at all save for his winning looks and charm seriously the part where he used xrays that show his motherinlaws cancer to bilk more money from his father then utilizes a subtle twist on the same scam to avoid eviction from his fancy home for failing to pay the lease on time its almost too much the guy has no shame whatsoever in fact hes more like the lead in stepfather than some poor schmuck who gets fired and is so humiliated that he cant face the disappointment of his family and friends and feels forced to invent a shiny new life for himself as vincent did in time out thus one could feel the tension mounting in nobodys life and the violent conclusion coming one thing nobodys life has that time out definitely lacked was a love interest apart from the protagonists trusting wife its not hard to understand how the sexy babysitter was able to fascinate and ensnare emile to the degree that he ignored the danger of her natural curiosity and allowed it to lay bare his less than carefully constructed con given the reservations mentioned this is a pretty good movie that we found entertaining if you long for something touching on similar elements that goes a might deeper and is more intellectually and spiritually satisfying i strongly suggest time out,1
this has got to be the worst horror movie i have ever seenbr br i hated it so much i wanted to come here and complain about how bad it was normally bad movies are no big deal but something about this one if you hated it you really hate itbr br if anyone liked this you probably enjoyed baby geniuses i thought i could never find a movie that was worse then that one i guess not,0

this is a collection of documentaries that last 11 minutes 9 seconds and 1 frame from artists all over the world the documentaries are varied and deal with all sorts of concepts the only thing being shared is 911 as a theme very minor in some cases some of the segements are weak while others are very strong some are political some are not some are solely about 911 some simply use 911 as a theme to touch on human feelings emotions and tragedies that are universal some are mainstream while others are abstract and artistic this film has not been censored in any fashion by anyone so the thoughts that you see are very raw and powerfulbr br this is a very controversial film especially for conservative americans i think two segments might really tick off the right wingers one from egypt where a dead american soldier and a dead palestinian bomber come back as spirits another from uk which recounts the usbacked overthrow of chile on sept 11 1973 which resulted in 50000 deaths and horrible atrocities the segment from mexico was the most powerful recounting the fall of the towers and the resulting death in vivid fashion you have to see it to believe itbr br even though the final product is uneven with some segments being almost pointless i still recommend this its very difficult to rank this film because the segments vary all over the place some weak some very powerful im giving this a rating of 9 out of 10 simply because some segments were excellent and covered issues that usually get censored mexico segment uk segment japan segment egypt segment,1

how to lose friends and alienate people is decent comedy with a bit of romantic approachbr br its actually a story of sidney youngsimon pegg breaking through in journalist and magazine writing business which is interpreted in a funny way simon pegg made an ok appearance slightly worse than his usual movie is not hilarious or funny all the way or anything like that but it has its moments and those moments are really hilariousbr br i recommend this fun and worth watching american with english cream comedy to all people who just wanna sit relax and enjoy movie for what it is if youre about to watch this movie with critical approach then you should pass unless you want to be disappointed and start trashing it,1
i rented the movie and liked it so much that i bought it elijah wood mikey and joseph mazello bobby are outstanding as the two boys their new stepfather physically abuses bobby the abuse is implied for the most part not seen and roused a lot of passion in me to help abused children there is a magical quality to the movie as the boys imagination helps them find a way to deal with the abuse you have to try to understand the story from a childs point of view im still thinking about the ending ive watched the movie 3 or 4 times and each time i think of possible new meanings im not sure exactly what richard donner intended me to think but this is an excellent film joseph mazello and elijah wood will make you go hug your kids,1
first off i saw another reviewer said this movie was fantastic well nothing could be further from the truth this movie is complete garbage a moronic horror comedy that is not even slightly funny dont take that mean that its so bad that its good because its not its a total waste of time and moneybr br heres what i see in this waste of a dvd a group of friends get together on a weekend get drunk and then decide to make a backyard video they grab mom and dads video camera and start coming up with scenes on the spot they all get a big kick out of watching themselves mug for the camera they figure if they think its funny then everyone will think its funny well theyre wrong this backyard home video is garbage the acting and comedic gore effects are lousy but i guess thats to be expected since this is nothing more then a home videobr br on the bright side i guess the fact that this crap got out there gives hope to anyone out there who wants to make a movie if these people could get their movie made and released on dvd then anyone canbr br 010 save your money,0
this is a very funny movie there is a self deprecating iconoclastic tone to the movie that is very appealing the characters are interesting the movie flows very well and holds your interest throughout the 1 hour 50 minutes duration of the film the film quality is not of the highest hollywood standards however the original film was supposed to be made in the genre of a gritty punkrock style the documentary about the attempt to make the film and the subsequent betrayal of the film makers is very well detailed and easy to follow the original film makers themselves become the main characters in the documentary version of the movie the interviews of the film makers and the actors has been assembled in a highly entertaining story that illustrates the struggles involved in making the original film the eventual failure of the original project and the phoenixlike rising from the ashes that evolved into this documentary film in my mind the documentary a texas tale of treason is a much more interesting and entertaining film than the original film waldos hawiian vacation would have ever been two thumbs up for a job well done,1
i really did like this show once upon a time that is until i realized all the faults in it its so unrealistic i know its fiction but it isnt even the slightest bit believable heres why spoilers ahead folks are we really supposed to believe that a kid like yugi would be descended from a pharaoh of ancient egypt cmon hes the biggest nerd on the face of the earth and whats up with the pharaoh aka atem andor yamis hair last i checked pharaohs were shaved except for a small bit of hair atop the head and wore fancy hatsbr br and are we supposed to be convinced that an evil wealthy boy genius named seto kaiba can legally run a successful business while still having time to go to a shoddy little school like domino high puhleeze first off hed have to legally be an adult to run a company and that would make him not really all too much of a boy genius since hed be the only adult in his class and second off why would he attend a school like domino high when his business is clearly successful enough for him to attend a fancy snobbish academy plus the side plots with his little brother are so sappy and lame every time you turn around that kids been kidnapped by goons for the baddie yawn nothing new nothing newbr br joey is the poor kid who lives with a goodfornothing father it says that joey earns all the money to attend his school because his fathers an alcoholic but you never once see joey do anything that resembles work he doesnt even mention work and his sister serenity is a complete moron why would she choose a snob like duke who dressed her brother in a dog costume and publicly humiliated him on television over a nice guy like tristan is she really that clueless various characters throughout the show get possessed by demonic forces get their souls stolen by demonic forces and fall prey to mental illness oh thats childsafe not tea is the typical girlnextdoor type whose only purpose is to be yugiyamis girlfriend and while she has some cool points to her she just doesnt have enough time to shine as a main characterbr br the animation is simply awful all the characters look sickly and anorexic the perspectives are terrible especially when they do closeups of somebodys hand and the colors look good but not stellarbr br but the worst plot hole to the series was the fact that yami says that his millennium puzzle can send souls back to their bodies if this was so how come he didnt save yugis grandpa in the first place when pegasus stole his soul and save himself the trouble of getting it backbr br all it really is is a commercial for itself the only plus side to it is yugioh the abridged series by littlekuribohbr br please do something more worthwhile like watch the abridged versionbr br 110,0
after seeing the film version of heart of darkness i feel as if i wasted 100 minutes of my life though the book was not my favorite i was very disappointed to see how poorly nicolas roeg portrayed the story despite the fact that he left out many bits of important information the cast just did not seem to fit their roles and the whole film seemed vastly emotionless the book depicts vivid scenery and detail that are completely disregarded in the movie br br youd think a director would be able to fit 76 pages of a book into a film of at least an hour and a half the differences completely changed the story for me for example when the character of kurtzs fiancée is nonchalant to the fact that kurtz has died it completely modifies the ending the book had given not to mention the sets and scenery used in the film were not nearly as beautiful as they were described it sincerely feels as if roeg was filming another story with references from heart of darkness embedded in it br br if you watch the movie without knowing the title or expecting it to be anything like joseph conrads tale you may find it good though i thought the camera work was poor and the cast unfitting it is a captivating story all the same however if you are looking for a good movie version of the famous classic story dont look for it in roegs film,0
what a long drawnout pointless movie im sure that historically this film is delightful but as entertainment goes it just doesnt make the grade ralph fiennes has been in some fantastic movies the english patient schindlers list but this one was such a letdown it didnt seem to be going anywhere his character at the beginning was so shallow and uptight it amazes me that his sister would ever have been interested at all dont bother paying to rent this movie buy yourself a copy of the english patient instead,0
this movie is a true masterpiece it really is its rare you come across such a heartwarming flick full of fun laughter heartbreak and with a little drama to keep you on your toes br br a true family film homeward bound tells the story of three brave pets who set out to cross the rocky mountains in an attempt to find their owners following the changes they go through and the obstacles they encounter along the way one of the truly stunning things about this movie is its ability to give animals human personalities the voice acting is that good shadow is a wonderful character old wise and brave and watching him trying to save sassy in the river was a very powerfully moving moment chance who wouldnt love a dog like chance hes got to be the most mischievous and lovable pup ever shown on the big screen and sassy is very witty for a cat she had me in stitches when she was mocking the keeper here kitty kitty kitty not on your life chubby br br there were also lots of well made emotional scenes such as sassy going over the waterfall i was truly scared for her shadow falling in the ditch almost in tears and then the fantastic ending when all three pets return home including good old shadow br br a favourite for all time anyone who doesnt like this film must just not like animals rent it or buy it now and itll leave you with happy memories thatll last a lifetime,1
i feel like i have some uberrare disease that no one has heard of and i have finally come across a support group on the net i finally found this title by asking for an answer on an experts site on the web i too saw this movie in my youth and was struck by the atmosphere and especially the ending i have never forgotten it and have never seen it since no one i know saw the film and i had almost given up on ever finding its title alas even knowing the name i shall probably never see the film again as it is impossible to find commercially small stepsbr br g,1
this movie is not only boring it is also really badly done the graphics are so bad they are not even second rate they are dreadful the characters do not show any facial expresssions the voice acting is empty and without any soul and the plot absolutely lacks well anything and everything my 5 year old likes it but thinks its a bit boring i agree with him,0
i would have given this film a one star vote had it not been for the laughs i got out of it some of the dialogs were just plain so lame that they make you laugh how could some one have actually talked like this not to mention the fact that the bodyguard majors antonio sabato jr flew a 747 like a pro and michael pares team of whiners were able to dig a trench filled with gasoline and blow up a huge boulder in the nick of time did anyone notice the lame tribute to fantasy island with the guy saying boss the plane to michael pare just as the 747 comes in sightbr br the only saving grace were the cute girls and even cuter female hijackers not to mention that the main hijacker deserved to die the lame death that he did for being such a joker imagine escaping from being tied up just to shot by a crossbow hellobr br the poor pilot probably died in the plane while everyone was eating steak and having rum just for laughs they should make a sequel to show us how they all spend the night in the midst of a category 3 hurricane on neptune atoll did i hear michael pare calling it the best honeymoon resort in the pacific now that would make an interesting movie,0
the greatest compliments to the other commentator here at imdb who asked himself why this series didnt get stuck in its time to last a lot longer like many other series in the 80s didbr br it is not true the series would have gotten worse if further continuedbr br i will at the end of this my comment post some thoughts about the other movie realizations rather attempts of the robin hood legendbr br first of all robert addie gisburne you are among us all you live foreverbr br nothing is as fun as the entire two if one wants three seasons of this absolutely unique series and at the same time absolutely agreeing with the mostly new and revolutionary findings of terry jones history documentations about egypt greece rome konstantinopel the goths and barbarians and the middle ages and crusades yes the monthy pythonterry jonesbr br if you have seen those brilliant and funny jonesdocs you will better much better understand all the historical background stuff carpenter the writer of the robin of sherwoodseries which happens to be the brother of john carpenter who made the thing their third brother makes music intended to tell usbr br the writer of dick turpin catweazle and the first two seasons of robin of sherwood called kip carpenter is my movie overlord hes better than all those others who criticize his swordandsorcery element or defectiveness taken from the robin of sherwood webring of this series that i can not see or have other nonfundamented criticism of which there existed a lot back then and still nowbr br thats why when you get to know this robin of sherwood better youll be severe you will at first loathe the third season not only that i did myself go thru this and on top of it i have only taken up the first two seasons into my deepest heart despite the fact that praed the actor of robin left this series because after the series had enormous success he was offered a probably better paid role in an absolutely ridiculous canadian series called the new adeventures of jules verne already the title reveals the emptiness of the whole project praed went for money and not for fame he didnt stick with his gang and kin i mean as actorsbr br actors who personally represent the afterwards really in our present time famous and legendary faces and characters of the robinlegend the potential of this series could and should have been let blossomed a lot more without any degrading niveau of content and historical message and rebellious accuracy regarding current political issuesbr br again obligatory to say a change of the main role was forced by praeds stupid decision of leaving robin of sherwood for a silly remakeseries of the vernetales and brilliantly woven into the filming of the story still it is in some aspects a catastrophebr br anyway if one is informed about this and that connery was maybe really advertised by his father but that the young connery did not at all chase,1
like most sports movies its not surprising that people who know something about the sport can find flaws in it as a soccer referee i have yet to see a movie or tv show get it right when depicting a match forever has good actors but i found sean astin to be a bit young to be an administrator in a juvenile jail i was very thankful that the plot did not involve the lead character turning his fellow inmates into rugby players and taking on flagstaff as well as highland which gets to credulity a police squad car just happens to pull up at precisely the time the flagstaff baddies are hazing rick penning even though rugby is not a sanctioned high school sport nationally the team is a schoolbased club sport much like rodeo that said i find it hard to believe that high school officials would allow students to play with open wounds that just isnt done in this day of aids and hepatitis i dont care what the tradition and macho image is despite that it was a cool movie in that teens were expected to act like adults and sometimes actually did sadly far too many coaches are like flagstaffs or worse,1
i just watched this movie for the second time and enjoyed it as much as the first time it is a very emotional and beautiful movie with good acting and great family values inspiring and touching,1
i recently watched spirit and enjoyed it very much ive seen it about 4 times now on hbo and will buy the dvd those who gave negative reviews would probably think that vanishing point was just another car chase movie and thelma louise was just another chick flick although the conclusions of those films are darker i feel the themes are somewhat related that freedom and individualism are very important and that there is usually someone wanting to take it away from you the other common trait of these movies is the caring thoughtful guardian angel types who help the main characters to overcome adversitybr br another review here mentions how this film relates to the theme of civilization invading someone elses home all one has to do is look around at the dwindling open areas around us to see thatbr br i thought the animation and the story were amazing the animators really got the horses to look act and move naturally spirits emotions were very clear as the story progressed yes im aware they do humanize the horses a bit but this is fiction in a couple of action scenes you feel caught in the current of the rapids and the heat from a forest fire in other more quiet scenes which are most of the time youre allowed to savor the backgrounds one of the big things that make the story really work is by not going the talking singing animals route doing so would take away from the storys power instead the flow of the story is told by occasional narration by the main character further punch is added by the fantastic soundtrack another plus is that they werent afraid to give the story somewhat of a dark side which really made this film watchable to me this isnt prevalent through the entire movie though and the conclusion is fitting and uplifting without being sappybr br those who appreciate horses will really like this movie but i think its a bit more than a horse movie i dont feel this would be a good movie to take children to if theyre brought up on the inane fare thats offered up today but if theyre the thoughtful sort that can handle compelling stories like the lord of the rings and black beauty theyll likely love this movie hell im 35 years old and still love that stuff,1
hong kong directors crossing over to hollywood to make movies is nothing new with the temporary exodus of the likes of tsui hark john woo ringo lam in the 90s from their collective output only a few movies or may i say just one made an impact at the box office the andrew lau and alan mak partnership has been a tour de force in recent hk cinematic history especially with their now famous infernal affairs trilogy which was remade into martin scorseses the departed so its no surprise when hollywood comes knocking on the doorbr br but without fellow collaborator mak who usually has scriptstory duties how did lau fare with writers hans bauer and craig mitchell its like the xfiles without the x in the way the story is crafted the characters and the parallels drawn with the chris carter series richard gere and claire danes pair up ala david duchovny and gillian anderson only that they dont belong to any federal investigative agency who bear arms but are employees of protective services whos chief role is to ensure that sexual predators who belong to their jurisdiction are kept safe from society when they are released from having served time hence they are the shepherds tending to their flock only that their flock suffer from sick sexual perversion with the propensity for violencebr br the parallels in characterization are so blatantly obvious that its just a cosmetic touch up on the outside like fox mulder geres erroll babbage is a strange lonely man consumed by his obsession in his quest to doggedly harass his flock to tote the line pained by a failed attempt to rescue a missing child just like how mulder pines for his missing sister babbage is shunned by colleagues and given the marching orders disguised as a retirement plan he has deep disgust for the people hes monitoring sick of their crimes and what they stand for that he has no qualms in using unorthodox methods short of flying off the handle while dishing out illegal preemptive punishment at the same time he too has strong urges that he has to fight against in order not to cross the line into becoming like those he loathes as part of routine he also scans newspapers and tabloids for clues and leads toward his objective that of seeking closure salvation for himself and possessing a strong belief that the truth is still out there and he wants to believebr br danes allison lowry on the other hand is the ingénue brought in to replace babbage but in the meantime while learning the ropes on the job for the next 18 days she is required to spy on him and to report his shenanigans pretty much like what dana scully was tasked to do with fox mulder as the disbeliever of preemptiveness and holding onto the notion that those discharged back to society have been cured of their temptations she slowly starts to see what babbage sees and understands that it takes a whole lot more than being just,1
ill make this short and sweetthis movie suckedbr br i watched part 1 earlier today and thought it was one of the greatest films ever gave it 9 out of 10 stars so i thought perhaps part 2 and 3 would be good sequels i was wrong this movie bored me to death and was so different from the first one it had the plot continue and thats it it was like bad outtakes from part one or somethingbr br i love walken but i felt sorry for him here i was so happy about glenn danzig being in this film but dont blink youll miss him there was a full cast full of crappy actors and people i dont like such as eric roberts and jennifer beals however it was a breath of fresh air to see ethan embry hes one of the funniest people on earthbr br this movie will make you like the first one a little less so dont watch it because you feel you owe it to yourself being a fan of part 1 i am gonna wait a few days before i watch part 3 and i pray it is better than this crapbr br the last scene of the movie with the lightning was one of the most beautiful things ever shown on film fast forward or skip to that if you cant stomach the first partbr br 1 out of 10 stars this was awful,0
i must say when i read the storyline on the back of the case it sounded really interesting but when i started to watch the movie seemed boring at first and even more at the end some scenes are way too long and the story has not been worked out properly,0
there are so many stupid moments in tower of deathgame of death 2 that you really wonder if its a spoof at times it felt like i was watching a sequel to kung pow rather than a bruce lee filmbr br to be honest this film has bugger all to do with game of death if anything its more a sequelremake of enter the dragon incorporating many elements of that film particularly the actual footage bruce lees character billy lo apparently investigates the sudden death of his friend and encounters a piece of film that was left with the mans daughter when the body is stolen during the funeral billy is also killed and its up to his wayward brother to avenge both mens deathsbr br tong long stars as brother bobby lo and doesnt really have the sort of charisma to carry the film his fighting abilities are very good however bruce lee obviously turns up thanks to no longer deleted footage simply to cashin on the legacy saying that on the whole the footage is actually editedin better than in game of death but it doesnt stop the film from being a messbr br ok so the fights are actually very entertaining dare i say mindblowing and make the film at least watchable but there are so many daft elements to this film that it really tests your patience first off theres the supposed villain who lives on his palatial estate or is that mental institution seriously the nutter eats raw venison drinks deers blood carries a monkey on his shoulder and owns some peacocks and lions this attempt to make him look tough and intelligent just makes you feel sorry for him you half expect someone to escort him back to his roombr br in fact this middle section is awful and when the scene involving a naked hooker and a lion suit arrived i turned it off however i did finish the film and was kind of glad i did because the fight scene towards the end much like god was the whole reason for watching while the story is an embarrassment the action is very good and contains excellent choreographybr br but even the finale disappoints if the premise was anything to go by what we were told was that the tower of death was a pagoda that was upside down and underground this sounded great like a twist on bruce lees original idea with different styles of fighting on each level could this be the game of death that was originally planned no the film should have been named generator room of death because thats as far as the tower goes of yes there were indeed one or two different styles there were foil clad grunts leopardskinned henchman and stupid monk its as though enter the dragon had never been made with the plot being a poor imitationbr br worth watching once for the fast paced fight scenes but so stupid sometimes that it hurts if this was intended then fine thumbs up however for recreating,0
prison is not often brought up during conversations about the best eighties horror films and theres a good reason for that because its not one of the bestbut as you delve past the classic films that the decade had to offer this is certainly among the best of the lesser knownsmaller films the film does have some connection to blockbusters for a start its an early directorial effort for renny harlin the capable director behind a number of action films including die hard 2 cliffhanger and deep blue sea and secondly we have an early role for lord of the rings star viggo mortensen the film is not exactly original but the plot line is interesting we focus on a prison that has been reopened after a number of years this was the prison where a man named charles forsyth was sent to the electric chair after being framed by the prisons governor naturally the spirit of the dead man is not resting in peace and when the old execution room is reopened the spirit of the dead convict escapes for vengeancebr br the film is not exactly the shawshank redemption but it does take care to build up its various characters and while the main point of the film is always the horror the prison drama behind it all does make for an interesting base this is a good job too because other than the basic premise the film doesnt really have a plot to go from and we solely rely on the interaction between the characters to keep things interesting the horror featured in the film is at times grotesque but its never over the top which might actually be the reason why this film is seldom remembered being released in a decade of excess the murders themselves are rather good and imaginative however and provide some major highlights as the film goes on we start to delve more into the backstory of the vengeful convicts ghost and while its fairly interesting some things about it dont make sense and it drags the film down a little still everything boils down to an exciting climax and overall i have to say that prison is a film well worth tracking down,1
this movie contains real animals been killed like a monkey been eaten by a snake and an crocible been cut open i find this totally deranged and sick and seriously question the mental health of the director of this trashbr br this movie is so stupid and daft that it has no logic at allbr br there is a lot of boobs and sex in this movie still dont bother viewing this trash for that if you want to see boobs and sex watch a porno instead there is also rape scenes in this movie which i found disgusting like women been raped and cut up and eaten this movie is for sadists and those who get their kicks seeing people been cut up and eatenbr br a lot of the animals like the monkey that appeared in this movie there is none in the jungles of new guinea the local characters most of them appeared to be asian and none look like they come from new guinea it looks like this movie was made around the grounds of a resort which i bet it wasbr br stay away from this trash its sick and deranged,0
the australian public and the australian film industry are often heard to complain that there are not enough great aussie films around or that they are all the samebr br well in this case this film is not a carbon copy of other australian films it is unique it will make you laugh outloud it will make you cry and it will make you feel really good about yourselfbr br the casting of this film is superb and the acting is second to none the script and the photography colourlight etc is wonderful but more important this is a great film i dont want to talk about the plot as i think it is always best to see a film knowing as little about it as possible suffice to say this film will appeal to a wide range of audiences take your girlfriend take your mum take your friends for a great evening outbr br 1010,1
the pallbearer is a disappointment and at times extremely boring with a love story that just doesnt work partly with the casting of gwyneth paltrow julie gwyneth paltrow walks through the entire film with a confused look on her face and its hard to tell what david schwimmer even sees in herbr br however the pallbearer at times is funny particularly the church scene and the group scenes with his friends are a laugh but thats basically it watch the pallbearer for those scenes only and fast forward the rest trust me you arent missing much,0
stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and deservedly so so i am happy to see any of their films basically a man at a horn factory is the fourth to crack and soon enough ollie cracks with all the horn noises he is resting at home with stan by his side needing quiet and the doctor james finlayson phones to say he is coming over to check on ollie after realising plumbing and electricity is muddled up by a crosseyed repairman the doctor comes in for a checkup and after some tests he recommends drinking goats milk and getting some sea air on the ocean after stan practises some trumpet playing hanging out the window by the phone cord and a car crash he and ollie to a dock to rent a boat they keep the boat on the dock trying to milk a goat and stan has brought his trumpet meanwhile the newspapers front page reads that killer nick grainger escaped convict richard cramer has escaped and he sneaks onto the boys boat while they are sleeping and the goat chews through the boat rope drifting out to sea in the morning the see their location and the killer comes out demanding something to eat and he spots stan and ollie making fake food eg string for spaghetti soap for cheese belt for bacon sponge for meatballs and he forces them to eat it when ollie starts choking on something stan blows his trumpet to help and ollies rage gets him punching the killer and it keeps going till the police arrive only to have ollies rage get them put in prison too there were the tiniest moments of comedy but it isnt a great black and white film well heres another nice mess youve gotten me into was number 60 on 100 years 100 quotes and stan laurel and oliver hardy were number 7 on the comedians comedian okay,0
this movie is kind of good it seem that they used the tyrannosaurus rex like a blown up balloon just like godzilla just maybe back in those 6070s days scientist havent got enough info on all sorts of dinosaurs back in those time scientist still making dinosaur so i guess this movie was base on a tyrannosaurus rex movements back in the 6070s there even a part where a giant rock fired by someone at the tyrannosaurus rex it damage the tyrannosaurus rex and it was knock out for a little while at the end the tyrannosaurus rex went back to search for food there is something wrong in the movie as well like a rifle how can one rifle kill a tyrannosaurus rex when it could be 10005000 stronger than we are if this film going to make a remake i suggest make it more good and excited because watching a old movie seems like to have a remake of it if lucky,1
did the first travesty actually make money this is another sequel along the lines of another stakeout that no one asked for but weve received it anyway the sequel is like its predecessor completely braindead its also pretty disgusting remember the dinner scene to think i almost felt sorry for ritter yasbeck and warden did they need the money that much,0
why on earth is colin firth in this pointless film has he really been that strapped for cashbr br the film isnt clear on what it wants to be about grief exotic places ghosts a vehicle for mr darcy its a muddled muddy messbr br there seems to be some sort of idea that italy must be good in itself and that italian has something to offer as a language but in the end the girls just want to go back to yanklandbr br there are pointless episodes on the beach in churches on busy roads but what it is all about or why anybody should care simply isnt clearbr br there was also a yank woman in the film it wasnt clear what here job was but she seemed only to be there to make vapid inappropriate and maudlin comments to the girl was it supposed to be about paedophilliabr br a pretty dreadful mess all in all i gave it 2 rather than 1 because it doesnt have the charm of an utterly ghastly film,0
not a bad concepti just wish they had taken it in another direction its a movie that tries to be interesting by shocking you with bestiality to begin with which works for most peopleprudes with weak stomachsbut besides this theres not much to this movie its not funny nor is it romantic so please somebody change that label and since i already knew that bestiality is actually legal most places and a million dollar industry i wasnt really shocked but most people do not know this and i thought that how the movie evolved after the secret came out was just disappointing because it could have been one of those shocking eye opener movies that would teach the ignorant about a fetish that is very much a reality foryes i did my homeworkhundreds of thousands of peopleso if you like watching bad movies that you can daydream about how you could make them better while watching them than surehave fun doing that,0
finally watched this shocking movie last night and what a disturbing mindfker it is and unbelievably bloody and some unforgettable scenes and a total assault on the senses looks like a movie from the minds of lynch specifically eraserhead buttgereit and even a little of begotten what this guy does to his pregnant sister is beyond belief but then again did it really happen or is it his brains left and right sides doing battle thats the main theme of this piece of art to draw a fine line between fantasy and reality and what would happen if the right side of the brain that dreams and fantasizes overtakes the reasoning and logical left side and the music in this movie is unbelievable a kind of electronic score that is absolutely perfect even though this movie is totally shocking and pretty disgusting in some of the most extreme scenes including hard core sex you will ever see in any movie i viewed it as a work of art and loved it and that music still amazes me i have to try and find the soundtrack if is available watching subconscious cruelty is a real event and not something the viewer will easily forget and a note to gorehounds this is a musthavebr br warning be careful buying this movie because some prints have fogging on the graphic sex scenes and extreme gore especially the copies from the japanese release,1
the premise of this movie is ugghhhh the guy is married and yet everyone on this site seems to think yeah this is funny cute and a good movie what the hell what is funny about immature girls fornicating with a married man with a new baby what is cute about the fact that he is cheating on his wife what have been wrong with them finding some teenage boys to have sex with before starting college noooo that is not good enough the guy has to be married offlimits offthemarket thats the one we gotta have dumbass girls then one of the girls decides that she loves the guy no she just loves the way he makes her feel two of the girls are having fun with it they think it is funny and no one seems to have any moral problems with what they are doing it just shameless but yeah this is all good with everyone one this website the darkhaired girl even has the audacity to have her dad pick her up from the guys house under the ruse of baby sitting this is a morally disgusting movie and where is the wife poor woman working and paying the bills while he screws the baby sitter,0
i knew the premise of this film and obviously i cant miss a good sounding film especially from master of suspense director sir alfred hitchcock basically tennis champ guy haines farley granger meets eccentric stranger bruno anthony robert walker on a train travelling from washington to new york bruno talks about a perfect murder guy hates his wife and bruno hates his father so bruno suggests swapping murders guy obviously didnt take him seriously until of course when guys wife miriam joyce haines kasey rogers or laura elliott is found murdered in an amusement park guy of course is the chief suspect and bruno keeps bumping into him reminding him of their plan and giving him more things to help him kill the father he wants dead this murder enquiry and brunos stalking are threatening his tennis career and his relationship with the daughter of sen morton north by northwests leo g carroll anne ruth roman bruno realises that guy wont do his murder so he decides to plant the evidence at the crime scene to make him guilty guys monogrammed cigarette lighter at the amusement park after his tennis game guy and anne who obviously found out the murder plan race to the amusement park to stop bruno and they have a fight on the speeding outofcontrol carousel also starring patricia hitchcock the directors daughter as barbara morton marion lorne as mrs anthony jonathan hale as mr anthony howard st john as police capt turley and john brown as prof collins and hitchcocks cameo is the man boarding train carrying a double bass some interesting dialogue and character interactions some good suspense moments and of course the unforgettable carousel finale a good classic film it was nominated the oscar for best cinematography sir alfred hitchcock was number 75 on the 100 greatest pop culture icons the film was number 32 on 100 years 100 thrills very good,1
pathetic attempt to use science to justify new age religionphilosophy the two have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said about quantum physics in this mess is just plain wrongbr br examples quantum theory supports the ideas in eastern religions that reality is an illusion how well in the world of the subatomic you can never definitely predict a particles location at a specific time you can only give the odds of it being precisely at one spot at one time also the act of observation seems to affect the event solid particles can pass through barriers all of this so far is accurate but then they assert that that means that if you believed sincerely enough that you could walk through a wall you could indeed do it this is complete poppycock instead the theory asserts that at our level it is possible for you to walk through a wall but it is merely by chance and has nothing to do with belief also youd have to keep walking into the wall for eternity to ever have even the remotest chance of passing through the wall the odds are so astronomically against itbr br this is but one example of how they misrepresent the science but much more annoying is the narrative involving an unhappy photographer played by marlee maitlan about halfway through the picture it becomes so confused as to be incomprehensible something to do with negative thoughts leading to addiction and selfhate there may be some truth to that but quantum physics has nothing to do with itbr br plus string theory is the hot new thing in physics nowadays instead of wasting your time with this dreck i suggest you rent the elegant universe an amazing series done for nova on pbs that gives you a history of physics from newton and gravity to ed witten and m theory in only 3 hourlong episodes quantum mechanics is explained there quite well if you want to know it without the fog of metaphysical appropriation,0
i had nowhere to go i was on a flight to vancouver i would probably have missed this film if i hadnt chosen air canada watched on a small screen in the back of the seat in front i found this captivating and mesmerising i did drift in a couple of places and had to skip back but i had to watch to its end now im looking forward to the dvd release in europe though whether ill be quite as transfixed when i can walk out the door is yet to be discoveredbr br the photographic composition is stunning and the film gives so much insight and fills out the story the photographs tellbr br recommended if you have time on your hands,1
i just finished watching dressed to killwhich is written and directed by brian de palmathe dvd had both ther rated version and the unrated versioni chose the unrated versionsince i have yet to view the r rated versioni cant be completely sure of the differencethere is however a very graphic graphic female nudity including a scene of explicit expression of self gratification in this versioni guess you could call this scene soft core pornif this sort of thing may offend youi would suggest you view the r rated versionbut i digressany comment from here on refers to the unrated versionthis is a murder mystery psychological horrorsuspense moviethere is very little violence and bloodthere is however one death sequence of notethe act of the killing itself is fairly graphichowever the blood it self does not look realit is reminiscent of how a 70s slasher film would looki believe this is done deliberately to offset the violence of the act itselfto give the scene a low budget feelmost of the violenceor rather possibility of suchis impliedthe film is very well pacedas far as i can tell every scene had a purposewhich i find very rare when compared to many of todays films anywayi also thought the acting was goodespecially angie dickinsonand micheal cane turns in a quietly understated performance in his rolewhich works brilliantly in this casethe movie also has one great twist in itin my mindalthough some people might find it predictablethe only complaintand its really more of an observationi have is that i thought the character played by nancy allen could have been fleshed out moreespecially considering she has a fair amount of screen timebut i think she does a good job with what she is givenand this doesnt really take away from the quality of the filmthe film also has a strong moral to itwhich is even more relevant todaybut the movie doesnt hit you over the head with iti also really liked the musical scorecomposed by pino dinaggioi felt it was very similar to the music in the original psychoto methis music really elevated the moviei thought this movie was brilliantfor medressed to kill1980is 1010,1
i remember all the hype around this movie when aaliyah was killed being a fan of ms rices novels my first thought was how can they do queen of the damned without doing vampire lestat firstbr br having finally seen the movie now i can see how they did it if you have read these books imagine taking out the gory parts from vampire lestat cramming marcus and marius into one character and removing everything to do with lestats beginning the wolf hunt his violin playing the theatre of the vampires and also louis claudia and gabrielle then in the last 15 minutes cramming in queen of the damnedbr br what we loose is a very important piece of lestats character his inner agony of having to kill to live the fact that he carefully tries to select killers as his victims and his lovehate relationship with louis armand gabrielle and all the other vampiresbr br also important to the story is that we loose the story of the twins which is the genesis of ms rices vampires and while i am sure the cannibalism was to intense for showing on the screen they could have done something closer and showed us more of ancient egyptbr br even worse we have this love interest thrown in between jessie and lestat the vampire chronicles is basically an american yoni story for those that do not know yoni is another form of hentai japanese porn comics but in yoni it is about gay male relationships told by a female while i am sure many men object to the gayness of the characters in this movie they went to the far extreme the opposite way for instead of lestat persueing killers he goes after young female groupiesbr br and the other flaws in logic and storyline are vast at the beginning lestat emerges from a century long sleep then later on asks marius how he made it through the 1950s in red velvet marius has no idea who elvis is and says he slept through that period makes you wonder how lestat knows about 50s fashion and music since he slept through the same time period himself and nothing is ever even mentioned about louis claudia or gabrielle i think that is a huge shame is like seeing snow white and the 3 dwarfsbr br overall the movie i thought was really bad about the only good thing about it was the soundtrack most of the acting was poor the accents drove me up the wall and all of the really indepth parts of the book were removed leaving us only with a hollow shell kind of like enkil after he was sucked drybr br if you want to see a good modern vampire movie get lost boys the original interview with a vampire or even some old episodes of dark shadows let this one rest in piece with a stake through the heart cloves of garlic around the neck and a vial of holy water in the mouthbr br in ending remember that before,0
probably will contain spoilersbr br after a successful attempt to get attention i would not call making sure that you get help before you die a failed suicide attempt joey finds out that she is pregnant and starts seeing images of spiritsbr br overall the movie was a little slow going but entertaining enough to watch the whole thing for a horror movie there were only a few minor creeps and thrills halfway through however was a really good scary scene i wont give it away though i watched this movie because i really liked the preceding movie the eyebr br i was a little confused however to determine that other than being a supernatural suspense movie from the same creators the eye 2 had no relation to the eye whatsoever different cast different story the eye2 does not even have anything to do with eyes br br the movie had a few questionable scenes joey attempts suicide 3 times 4 times if you count the time when witnesses say they saw joey trying to jump in front of the train she is associated with brutally defacing an attacker she freaks out in a restaurant and witnesses say she was attacking people and yet she is allowed to go about her business freely without even so much as a psyche evaluation or put in the hospital for reasons other than her pregnancybr br the movie was not the greatest horror movie the story was rather farfetched even for a fiction movie p the spooks were either few andor nothing we have not seen before however it was an interesting story and once you know what the truth is behind the spooks it was an interesting twist on the ghost storybr br i rate the movie 3 out of 10,0
if you are viewing this show for the first time you may start wondering if you are in an alternate reality colorful and imaginative characters entertaining dialogue plots that seem to have some depth to them even creating atmospheres of suspense and drama at times i mean this is a syndicated childrens show right this is the same venue that has brought kids such drek as pokemon pepper ann mighty morphin power rangers and vr troopers please note that three of the titles mentioned above are crass japanese exports courtesy of the fox network and saban entertainment dont worry you are just sampling some of the quality fare that was available to kids during the late 1980s and early 1990s some examples of this period would be transformers garfield and friends captain power and cops a cartoon not to be confused with the live action show on fox besides these prime examples disney also returned to syndicated programs for kids coming up with a lineup called the disney afternoon aside from a dumbeddown show called the gummi bears early shows like darkwing duck duck tales and chip n dales rescue rangers gave credence to the disney animation teams that were also turning out theatrical classics like the little mermaid beauty and the beast the rescuers down under and the great mouse detective but above all these wonders shines talespin the premiere of plunder and lightning was a twohour thrill ride and won an emmy much to my delight the rest of the episodes were up to par on the promise of the premierebr br while i enjoy the plots and dialogue i guess for me the greatest attraction are the characters theres rebecca cunningham an independent female but still fallible kit cloudkicker full of preteen angst and optimism louie with his loyalty and support frank wildcat the most entertaining engineer since scotty on the original star trek molly cunningham cute and witty but with some depth that most child characters dont have and of course in the middle of it all theres baloo whom i would describe as a slobby version of james bond this is because whenever theres trouble baloo saves the day with the assistance of his sleekerthanmost fastestofall sea duck read james bonds aston martin of course every great show has to have great villains and talespin doesnt disappoint here either from the megalomania of businesstiger shere kahn to the vain and always failing air pirate don karnage to the hilarious and inept sovietsatirized thembrians the animation is good the music appropriate and the episodes are for me the finest that childrens programming has ever had to offer great fun for the whole family,1
victor nunez imbues this unsentimental tale of a young womans emotional journey with a sense of poetry seldom seen in cinema by poetry i mean the sense in which the literary and the cinematic come into play there is something very literary about the film almost as if a novel has been adapted page by page to screen in this sense the film achieves depths many cannot but it is also rather slow at other times undercutting the depths it once achieved in favor of ennui the films star ashley judd has not yet made a better film than her debut here she fits the role of lead ruby like a glove almost as if she didnt have to act she has true movie star presence in the film and hasnt really managed to convey the same allure in her later films although she was impressive in normal life,1
it is always great to see a movie that teaches us about history in africa as they are definitely too few however the movie depicts lumumba as a political leader who wanted the new independent country to be the same as the old colonialist one i felt it hard to sympathise with this kind of leadership yet the movie is somewhat like a homage to the man there was too little content explaining how the man got to rise in the first place and the whole context of belgium letting them go so it is certainly worth going to see as the acting and photography are excellent especially mobutu himself i would just have liked a better political analysis,1
i had been wanting to see an american werewolf in paris for a long time because i loved its predecessor but this film didnt impress me as much as an american werewolf in london actually to be quite honest it didnt impress me at allbr br tom everettscott and his dude pals are wandering paris and in a preposterous bungee stunt off the eifel tower rescuing wolfbabe julie delpy from death before youve time to work out if the constant mugging and lumpy dialogue is meant to be the stuff of comedy a fullmoon has hit and the brats are being chased by dreadful cgi werewolves down parisian sewersbr br the script is disgustingly poor the actors were made to make this film theyre horrible performances match the status of the movie from start to end this movie is never entertaining engaging or even slightly watchable i had trouble watching this whole film without throwing up my dinner to be quite honestbr br the action scenes arent exciting the jokes arent funny and the werewolves arent scary in short miss out or be haunted foreverbr br i rate an american werewolf in paris 2 out of 10,0
creepshow 2 is little more than a pale imitation of the original designed with little purpose other than to cash in on the name of the previous film it even amplifies the flaws of its predecessor which was often predictable and heavyhanded still the first time around there were enough thrills to make up for its periodic lulls resulting in an uneven but overall fairly entertaining effort the sequel has few worthwhile moments so the transparency of the stories are even more apparent once in a while it delivers but most of the time it just lingers therebr br as in the original all the stories revolve around the common theme of revenge and just desserts a wooden indian comes to life wreaking vengeance upon the killers of its owner teenagers are devoured by an aquatic monster a hitchhiker returns from the dead to pursue a careless motorist none of these premises are inherently bad in themselves but they are utterly lacking in inspiration there are few surprises and no scares this a textbook example of unmotivated bythenumbers filmmaking it doesnt help that this cheaplooking movie suffers from a flat directorial style although to be honest there wasnt much to work with in the end the second story comes off best but not by much br br for the most part the performances are okay at best george kennedy as the illfated general store owner does an adequate if not particularly inspired job dorothy lamour on the other hand is quite good as the guiltridden motorist evoking sympathy for her plight despite the predictable redundant material however most of the characters are pretty thin overall br br one would think that creepshow 2 would have turned out better george romero who directed the original returned to pen the screenplay based on more of stephen kings stories makeup effects artist tom savini turns in some good gory work so why is the film a letdown i guess romero didnt really want to make a second film but was forced to do so for financial reasons it was a decade of horror sequels clones ripoffs and whatnot so this one was certainly inevitable i can imagine the guy writing the script in a hurry picking up his paycheck and running off i guess he had to do what was necessary to get his own projects financed we cant blame himbr br rating 12 out of br br released by new world pictures,0
it starts out looking like it may be going somewhere then quickly leads the main characters into a threering circus of remarkable stupidity which permanently destroys any likability of the characters im a huge collector of stoner movies but this is something i would not consider a valid addition bong water is trash from the very deepest regions of the dumpster and i wouldnt be caught dead with this on my shelf im actually convinced this movie was created by a partnership for a drug free america if youre a jack black fan then i would say that you may think 5 minutes of the movies is ok because jack black continues his legacy of singing songs for retards i really cant say enough bad things about this movie,0
typically a movie can have factors like arousing good feel sense of purpose plot etc theres always something that can be taken out of movies its just a matter of how compelling the reason is for me to own it in my collection tale of two sisters as they call it when it was released in my country has tremendous feel and an eventually mostly selfexplaining plot i love horror movies that revolve around a house titles that come to mind are the others the haunting the haunting of hell house this movie will be a another great example that i will remember the movie had extremely rich colour in the way the house was decorated in the clothes that the characters wore in the openskied daylight scenes that is in contrast to most horror movies which typically makes use of desaturated tones and gloomy environs think honogurai mizu no soko kara dark water which is another show i like that gives this film a sense of aesthetics and joy when it wasnt in its more gripping moments the characters are extremely believable this may be partly attributed to the familiar setting of this movie maybe domestic issues are easier for both myself as well as the actors to identify with and the actors become their characters with exceptional finesse the director toys with timelines in order to give the audience the story in bits and pieces allowing them to come to their own terms of interpretation instead of presenting everything in a linear fashion this is a positive aspect of this film in my opinion and perhaps it is my interpretation of this movie that allows me to find it enjoyable i would definitely look out for this on dvd,1
the extended nuclear family united in business as well as in personal life is examined in this serious study of a grown sons conflict with his fathers desire that he remain in the family business this triggers a midlife crisis which may or may not be ameliorated by an affair and retreat to a shrinks couch very fine acting by all a sleeper that deserves wide attention,1
if you like bad movies this ones a real treat kaufman peters stagger around in robot costumes escape slavery only to wander aimlessly and find true robot love i believe this is the first movie that ever made me consider walking out i should note i was 12 and could be entertained by shiny objects,0
john parrish is an ex union officer who plans to sell his ranch and land to the wilkisons over at anchor the trouble is that the price being offered is way to low and when they start to bully parrish and his workers he has a change of heart particularly when things take a brutal turn for the worsebr br originally after watching this one i had a sense of frustration chiefly because of the cast that was involved when you got edward g robinson glenn ford and barbara stanwyck in the same movie you hope that they get a story and script from which to excel sadly they dont get chance to produce a western classic worthy of multiple revisits or is that my over expectation is doing it a disservice well i slept on it and decided to ponder further about the picture i think yes its fair to say that the actors in question deserved a better story from which to work from it is when all is said and done a plot that has been milked for all its worth and then some but the violent men is still a very rewarding film regardless of the missed opportunities evident with the productionbr br glenn ford as parrish is as cool as an eskimos nose throughout and its always great to see babs stanwyck playing a bitch because shes good at it while eddie g when one gets used to him being in a western is fine in what is an under written part robinson who stepped in at the last minute when first choice as lee wilkison broderick crawford got injured is the one who is short changed the most by the makers even supporting characters such as the devilish wade matlock a grinning delight from the reliable richard jaeckel and judith wilkison a radiant dianne foster get something to leave an impression with but for what it is robinsons crutch toting bad guy is at the least memorable for all the right reasonsbr br not shy on action and gun play its with the twists and almost shakespearean tragedies that rudolph matés film rises above the mundane with all of it gorgeously framed by burnett guffeys stunning cinematography lone pine in alabama has been used on many a western picture see seven men from now for another glorious use of it but here guffey really excels and manages to dazzle the eyes at every turn the violent men isnt a great western picture and perhaps a better director than maté could have really given donald hamiltons the big country novel an adaptation to be proud of but for every niggle and irk i personally had with it i found two more reasons to actually really like it so that it be its recommended for sure 710,1
this film although not totally bad should have been filmed where the actual events took place grand island nebraska was devastated by no less than seven tornados on the night of june 3 1980 grand island is situated in the nearly treeless flat platte river valley in hall county the makers of this movie filmed in the tree covered hills of ontario and moved the whole event to a nonexistant town called blainsworth the people of grand island bravely survived this awful night only to be forgotten because of a poorly made movie,0
i first saw this movie when i was in elementary school back in the 1960s i was fascinated with the character played by ingrid bergman and it was my introduction to the french quarter of new orleans the first part of the movie is the best as she comes back to exact some revenge on her fathers wife and daughter her mother had been driven out in disgrace during this time she meets the wonderful clint maroon played by gary cooper the chemistry between the two is great the second half of the movie takes place in saratoga ny the saratoga of the title and i never enjoy it as much as the new orleans setting but its still very good i give this movie a ten partly out of nostalgia but mostly because its just a darn good movie and the characters besides those of bergman and cooper are equally wonderful flora robson comes close to stealing the scenes from bergman it used to be shown on tv periodically but its shown rarely if ever it would be a good one for one of the classic movie stations to pick up and put into their programming cycles,1
i first saw this when it came out in the theater though only 13 at the time i was an avid reader of hard science science fiction stories the technical gaffes of the film are burned into my memorybr br some of the following may have significant spoilersbr br even as a youngster i knew the premise is silly the rocket takes off for a lunar mission in a cosmos where there is always a gravitational effect on the crew though loose objects float as in zero gravity and because of that the cabin the area with the controls whatever they called it was gyrostabalized to maintain the correct orientation so that when they landed why didnt they land standing on their heads and where at least in nearearth space the rocket engines had to be running continually with propellant combusting away without an oxidizer when the engines quit the rocket stopped _dead_ in space and couldnt start going until a phd chemist determined it needed at a little oxidizer this time the rocket recalled it had momentum and the next thing our heroes know theyre near mars even a 13yearold nerd knew such a minimumenergy trip would take over 200 daysbr br they land find the air was breathable though at the time scientific data revealed that the pressure even if the atmosphere were pure oxygen would be too low to do any good they decide to camp outside the ship and even build a campfire they come armed even though they were supposedly going to the moon where firearms wouldnt be neededbr br they get a sight of a collapsed civilization encounter stray martians who look just like people develop an anti nuclear war philosophy and those who survive try to get back to the home planet and die in the attempt by crashing on the earth to do that would require such a long orbital period theyd have died of starvation long before approaching their destinationbr br the film it preceded destination moon used real science most effectively even though their rescue with the oxygen tank forgot about the moment arm from the tanks center of gravity to the output nozzle this film showed woeful ignorance of even the most basic science only the most technologically illiterate should think of it as a science fiction film its on a par with the old flash gordon serials where their rocketships took off from their bellies and climbed in spirals and whose engines were always onbr br the story on this one i considered banal and i can recommend this only as a film to be shown to students for them to pick out technical gaffes,0
this is a totally awesome movie if you havent seen it yet you damn well should sure the plot is slow to develop the special effects are laughable the acting is ridiculous and the action is badly choreographed but as wrestler ddp would say thats not a bad thingthats a good thing everything about this movie is hilarious especially if you get the dubbed version which has even worse actors its countless laughs until you get to the end yearning for the sequel where the mummy fights wrestling women thus i give it ten stars unless youre one of those discriminating and intelligent people with good taste who likes only high quality films of the highest calibre i recommend this utterly monkeydellic movie,1
this film held my interest enough to watch it several times the plot has holes but the lead performers make it workbr br catherine mary stewart julia kerbridge does a great job as a woman of 37 who has sacrificed everything else to become a physician she worked years to earn the money to go to medical school she is performing brilliantly in her residency and is just about to take her board exam and realize her dreambr br meanwhile julias sister and brotherinlaw are murdered and as the nearest living relative she is compelled to take in her niece amanda arlen aguayostewart to avoid having her become a ward of the state amanda is about 7 years old from her appearance amanda is so traumatized from her parents murder that she has become mute needless to say julias 16hour days get longer caring for amandabr br rob lowe plays kevin finney a charming neighbor man in their apartment building who works his way into the lives of julia and amanda he is always there with a trick or a joke to help amanda deal with her distress amanda really starts to warm up to kevin as the film progresses perhaps more than to her aunt julia starts to rely on kevin to take some of the load of caring for amanda as she attempts to handle her case load and prepare for her board examination kevin is always there whenever some crisis erupts for juliabr br the chemistry between rob and catherine mary was great you keep watching to see them get together before the end of the film the chemistry between rob and arlen was good as well arlen managed to convey quite a lot without the benefit of words the plot had julia and amanda gradually warming up to each other you can see them working out a relationship as the film progressesbr br we discover that julias sister and brotherinlaw the meyers were involved in industrial espionage they stole an extremely valuable prototype microchip from their employer they had three associates who intended to share the proceeds of the theft julia discovers that the meyers were planning to skip the country under assumed identities the plot is unclear whether the meyers intended to double cross their associates or were themselves double crossedbr br in any case the meyers are murdered in their home by 2 of their former associates the killers make no attempt to extract the location of the microchip from the meyers before killing them the killers search the home and fail to find their prize they leave a living witness to their crime amanda the killers then spend the remainder of the film making clumsy attempts to extract the microchip from julia and amanda who have no idea where the prize is located eventually the killers kidnap amanda in hopes she knows something about the microchips locationbr br eventually julia discovers the truth about kevin he is an investigator hired to recover the stolen microchip after some rough moments in the relationship they manage to,1
hayao miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using handdrawn animation as a form of storytelling yet often he is being compared to walt disney that is just so unfair because it becomes apparent by watching miyazakis films that he is the superior artist he really has a gift of thrilling both grownups and children and laputa is indeed one awesome ridebr br but where can i begin to describe a movie so magical and breathtaking miyazakis works have never cease to amaze me laputa is an adventure of a grand scale and i wonder how a film can be so packed with details and imagination ask yourself this question if you are a kid dreaming of an adventure so grand in scope and so magical what would it be like the answer would be to strap yourself in some seat and watch laputa because its truly a childhood fantasy come true every minute of the movie is rich and engrossing from the train chase to the amazing airflying sequences and to the wonderous sight of the floating castle itself not to mention the excellent score by joe hisaishi everything you ever possibly want from an adventure movie is here,1
the bat people is a proud resident of the imdb bottom 100 every once and a while the movie suddenly vanishes from the infamous list depending on whether there are new movies with paris hilton in the lead or documentaries about american idol stars but it always reliably returns sooner or later and why because unlike the majority of crap in that list the bat people is a legitimate bad film and it deserves to be on there regardless of any media influences or internet buzz this nearly isnt the worst film ever made since the basic concept definitely has a certain charm and ingenuity but its still indescribably difficult to sit through the whole thing the script is incredibly boring with absolutely unnecessary padding footage and gigantic gaps in continuity and yet the main characters still remain total strangers throughout the entire film other than a sensible screenplay the film also lacks spectacular killing sequences and the makeup effects although courtesy of a young stan winston are ludicrously inept and remain largely unseen until the end of the film the films title is inaccurate as people refers to a number in plural whereas the story actually just revolves on one bat person much more than bruce wayne the real batman plays in this movie and he as well has a genuine batcave and a batmobile a stolen ambulance the plot introduces a young couple on their honeymoonweekend exploring caves they wander off from a guided tour group and he gets bitten by a bat whilst trying to protect his wife from the animals vicious attack worried that he might be infected with rabies he undergoes an intense treatment at the local hospital but still this doesnt prevent him from slowly transforming into a bloodthirsty bat creature he kills random people at night and toys around with the suspicious police sergeant whilst his loving wife is still vastly convinced the awkward behavior is exclusively due to allergic reactions to the rabies treatment sure honey the script never explains why a bat would attack people and how come john always changes back into a normal human being at the dawn of a new day instead of gradually turning into a permanent state of batguano so basically the bat people is a variation on the good old werewolftheme but obviously not a very interesting one the concept showed a lot of potential but somehow the sub plots center on whiny drunks and perverted sheriffs instead of on ghastly monsters some of the settings and exterior filming locations look impressive the misfit song playing during the credits is strangely catchy theres a nice bit of gore during the climax finally and main actress marianne mcandrew is ravishing to look at though not to listen to this truly bad and boring films current listing in the bottom 100 is spot number 80 and personally i hope it sticks somewhere in that region the list simply wouldnt feel and traditional without the bat people,0
michigan edgar allen poe a toaster and a frying pan if you dont mind the psychothriller or horror film genre and you have a special place in your heart for the twisted this is the movie for you an amazingly well developed first film hatred of a minute has all the draw of mainstream hits like silence of the lambs and of cult classics like army of darkness the editing and effects are well done better than many films in the genre kallio weaves an intricate tale of torment drawing on both the bible and poes writings at a time when big budget big name films lack much in the way of substance the independent film has resurrected this dying trait if you love michigan a good story or a decent thriller go check out hatred of a minute,1
only watched this to see joe morton in an early role and honestly wished i hadnt bothered he can and has since done much better than this crap cannot understand why anyone finds this kind of stupidity funny but each to his own it is an absolute mess and not funny in the least no wait one line only was funny where mr kent joe and his family are having dinner with this nut job as hes been invited for dinner lord alone knows why pest to mr kent you know what its like dog youve been there mrs kent not lately joes expression was funny but thats it one line does not make a great comedy and this tat is so far away from being funny it should be consigned to the nearest trash cart its only good enough for that joe morton glad to see you dont appear in rubbish like this anymore you are far superior and a great great actor,0
when i was a little girl i absolutely adored the swan princess it was reliving the same fairy tales of snow white sleeping beauty and cinderella the princess and her prince who saves the day is always a timeless story that will never die well hopefully but i figured that i would check out the sequels for the swan princess to see what they were like and unfortunately this is the typical cartoon sequel that just disappoints more than entertains the only character i found still very amusing was the queen she was very funny in this movie and had the best part but with the voice changes they were noticeable and also bothered me quite a bit i dont mean to be picky just it was too weird for me the story also was just more or less borrowed from the first swan princess just the villain in this movie is following rothbarts footstepsbr br odette and derek are about to celebrate their one year anniversary but derek has been too preoccupied with fighting for his kingdom to keep it safe with his mothers birthday also coming up he forgets about that since there is a new villain in town clavious who is hoping to go above and beyond where rothbarts powers went and kidnaps the queen on her birthday but odette must change back into her swan self in order to help derek fight him and save his motherbr br the swan princess 2 is of course more than alright for the kids that i never mind its good clean fun for them the reason why these sequels are disappointing though is because it is usually just for the kids that is the audience they aim for but its more enjoyable when the jokes and story can be enjoyed by everyone now there are a few laughs and giggles here and there but this wasnt as clever in my opinion to the first swan princess i would recommend it for the little ones but if youre looking for a fun cartoon movie id recommend staying with the first swan princessbr br 410,0
holy crap this is so hysterical why arent american comedies written like this for anybody who thinks comedy has to be dumb there is more wit and intelligence in the six episodes of this series than in a shelf of novels hugh laurie is a complete hoot i couldnt believe it was the same guy as house there are so many great lines and gags in this series you could watch each show dozens of times and still pick up on new things each time rowan atkinson is hilarious as the verbose and put upon butler edmund this is my favorite of all the blackadder series and tony robinson is wonderful as ever as the somewhat obtuse heart of the series the oppressed mass baldrick some of my favorite lines when someone messes with a wellington he really puts his foot in it and baldrick explaining how he got his name and cousin macadder the top kipper salesman and homicidal swordsman from scotland,1
anyone who knows me even remotely can tell you that i love bad movies almost as much as i love great ones and i can honestly say that i have finally seen one of the alltime legendary bad movies the almost indescribable mess that is myra breckinridge an adaptation of gore vidals bestselling book he later disowned this film version the starstudded myra breckinridge is truly a movie so bad that it remains bizarrely entertaining from beginning to end the xrated movie about sex change operations and hollywood was an absolute catastrophe at the box office and was literally booed off the screen by both critics and audiences at the time of its release not surprisingly the film went on to gain a nearlegendary cult status among lovers of bad cinema and i was actually quite excited to finally see for the first timebr br director michael sarne who only had two other previous directing credits to his name at the time took a lot of flack for the finished film and in honesty it really does not look like he had a clue about what he was trying to achieve the film is often incoherent with entire sequences edited together in such a halfhazzard manner that many scenes become nearly incomprehensible also irritating is the gimmick of using archival footage from the fox film vaults and splicing it into the picture at regular intervals this means that there is archival footage of past film stars such as judy garland and shirley temple laced into newlyfilm scenes of often lewd sexual acts and the process just doesnt work as intended this also caused a minor uproar as actors such as temple and loretta young sued the studio for using their image without permissionbr br perhaps sarne is not the only one to blame however as the films screenplay and casting will also make many viewers shake their heads in disbelief for instance this film will ask you to believe that the scrawny film critic rex reed in his first and last major film role could have a sex change operation and emerge as the gorgeous sex goddess raquel welch the film becomes further hard to follow when welch as myra attempts to take over a film school from her sleazy uncle played by legendary film director john huston seduce a nubile female film student farrah fawcett and teach the schools resident bad boy roger herren a lesson by raping him with a strapon dildo did everyone follow that br br and it gets even better or worse depending upon your perspective i have yet to mention the films topbilled star the legendary screen sex symbol of the nineteenthirties mae west ms west was 77 year old when she appeared in this film she had been retired for 26 years and apparently she still considered herself to be a formidable sex symbol as she plays an upscale talent agent who has hunky men including a young tom selleck throwing themselves at her as if this werent bad enough the tonedeaf west actually performs,0

i read all of nancy drew as a preteen and collect the books as a grownup i loved the effect used at the end and a little bit at the beginning of the movie where line drawings in the style of the books morphed into scenes from the movie it was a neat way of pointing out connections between situations in the movie and the books for example the scenes with the oriental antiques dealer were very reminiscent of many scenarios i remember from the books i thought ned was perfectly cast and emma roberts was a wonderful 21st century interpretation of nancy drew just like the picture of betty crocker she keeps up with the times,1

well its robin hood as geezer all right just as advertised that didnt sound very hopeful and alas it was worse than id suspectedbr br a laddish robin i can take a robin who tangles with a pert dyers daughter i can credit but a robin who exchanges notveryfunny banter with his single henchman is harder to swallow and a robin and entire cast who seem to be having difficulty managing their lines is the kiss of doom how could anyone let such laboured delivery pass without reshooting the scenes again and again much sounds as if hes struggling with halfcomprehended shakespeare rather than letting loose with a salty quip i hoped at the onset that it was just a failed comedy trait in a character clearly destined for the role of comedy sidekick but then it started spreading throughout the rest of the castbr br whatever else you say about errol flynn in the role he had the knack of delivering highflown dialogue as naturally as if hed just thought it up on the spur of the moment and as this production shows thats not at all as easy as it sounds if they were going to cast the characters as cheeky chappies the actors in question should have been given appropriate lines they sound as if they havent a clue how to handle thembr br im afraid i didnt even like the pantomime sheriff for a similar reason the lines are clearly not intended to be taken seriously but delivered and in this case written with a nudge and a wink at the audience theyre out of place all right fourthwallbusting stuff but really not that funnybr br this muchpromised production reminded me of a limping school play the only actor and character i felt any appreciation for at all was the one playing guy of gisbourne who was the sole one who appeared to have any handle on a credible villainy and b credible characterisation but frankly i wouldnt have said that was a very good augury for the future of the series as of the time of writing ill give it another shot in the hopes that things may improve and bed down a bit by next week with less stilted scenesetting required and perhaps the actors more at ease with the dialogue after all the opening episode of doctor who wasnt exactly a showstopper though it was nowhere near as bad as this but if i see no improvement after episode 2 im afraid the series has almost certainly lost one viewerbr br which would be a pity because ive got a soft spot for the robin hood legend on screen from the adventures of douglas fairbanks to the sturdy reliance of richard greene but this robin fails to stir my blood in the slightest,0
im in iraq right now doing a job that gives plenty of time for watching movies we also have access to plenty of pirated movies this gem came along with 11 other movies and this is easily the worst ive seen in a long time ive seen a few other reviews that claim this movie doesnt take itself too seriously but really i think thats a cover up for the fact that its horrible its not tongue in cheek the writers really thought they were improving on the movie blade this movie is just one notch above vampire assassin which if you havent seen i recommend at least that movie is so unbelievably bad that youll laugh harder than you thought possible this is right at that cusp of no redeeming qualities what so ever from the bad acting to cliché visual ie opening credits to the adobe premier special effects they couldnt even get blanks for the guns which may have to do with where the movie was filmed but if youre going to use effects make them close to accurate as for the cast it seems like they just went to a tae bo class and picked up the first not to ugly chick that walked out once again like ron hall in vampire assassin dont let stunt folk act they cant also the comment about this being a return of old vampire moviesno its not this is exactly what all new vampire movies are about buffy the vampire slayer blade underworld theyre all about some super star fighting the vampires this is the newest vampire genre with bad blood fake screams and cheesy over acting obviously anyone who wrote a good review about this is somehow connected to the movie or friends of the cast but what do i care i paid 33 cents for it anyway to wrap this up someone in their first semester of film school decided to make a movie i give them credit because its better than i could do of course i also know i cant make movies so i dont try i do know how to watch movies though i work 12 hour nights 6 days a week ive seen several thousand in the year ive been out here and this was so bad that half way through i was hoping for a mortar attack,0
the first of five st trinians films although the last is usually discounted was based around artist ronald searles schoolgirl characters and features the wonderful alastair sim in drag as millicent fritton headmistress as well as her own brother much of the humour is dated yet curiously touching and outrageous in todays pc world the girls drink gamble smoke and are later sold off to rich arabs yet always remain in charge defeating bureaucrats police judges and other establishment figures as they maraud across england perhaps because the films have been so regularly seen on tv st trinians still inspires fancy dress parties and club nights the films have recurring characters that include pc ruby gates joyce grenfell and flash harry george cole the precursor to the entire series is a charming film called the happiest days of your life 1950,1
i would not hesitate to put this adaptation of death trap in a top 5 list of the best stagetomovie adaptations ever caine and reeves an underrated actor who never really got a chance to do more than soggy romances and superman play off each other extremely well here even dyan cannon who i normally dont care for is perfectly cast in a role that exploits her annoyance value as an actressbr br im not sure that comparisons of deathtrap with sleuth another brilliant stagetoscreen adaptation featuring michael caine are valid or even fair yes the two stories have a lot in common but sleuth is as much about class warfare as the battle of wits and the house in sleuth is set is at least as much a character in the movie as the two actors the house doesnt really have an equivalent in deathtrap and deathtrap isnt so much a battle of wits as it is a pointed vignette about how people are no damned good and never as smart as they think they are and deserve everything they get ill just say that both movies are superb examples of the genre and well worth your time and money this is america after all you dont have to choose br br i wont give away the twists and turns of the plot but i dont think it matters anyway ive watched the dvd eight or nine times in a dozen years and still enjoyed the chemistry and the timing and the mean scary moments when things go all pear shaped its all done so well that the ride becomes more important than the actual destinationbr br anyone who likes blackhearted comedy and suspense in the hitchcock style of filmmaking will probably enjoy deathtrap immensely,1
this is a wellmade documentary on the exciting world of indy car racing the photography is simply outstanding the scene were mario andretti drives the old racing roadster down the new england street lined with the ancient maples leaves blown to the side by the speed of the car is incredible the film does lose some of its beauty on the small screen but if you like watching cars driven to their limit you should see this film,1
im normally a fan of bruce willis and despite him playing the coldhearted professional killer i thought him the most appealing character here that said his character makes such a mess of his professional activity its incredible he hasnt been caught before the plot is thin to the point of being nonsensical the end was no less annoying and insulting for the fact that it could have been predicted from about 20 minutes into the moviebr br spoilers follow in hollywood morality the good guys always win with a few casualties along the way and the bad guys die or are at least heading for justice by the end the breathtaking insult of the film is the way that our ira terrorist who has somehow become a cuddly touchyfeely character gets to walk off to a new life as does his former terrorist playmate who is now a loving wife and motherbr br whos the bigger villain the former and so far as we can tell unrepentant terrorist or the hired assassin i dont see much to choose between them in real life or in the filmbr br this is the poorest film ive seen this year,0
this is a brilliant film the story starts off in romaniawhere billy crystal stars as an agent who can talk anybody into doing anything there is a really funny scene here where crystal is a child and talks his father who is a rabbi into eating pork you filmophiles may know that this is a parody of crystals religion he is mainly a talent scout and hes trying to find a suitable villain for his latest movie after finding out that the whole film has a terrible crew he accidently falls into a small river believing he is dead some huge hands come out to reach him he later thinks he is in heaven he finds out that he isnt but that he is in a monastery believing god saved him he becomes a monk searching for who saved him he later finds a 7 ft 7 in man who he casts as the perfect villain he also recites shakespeare see the film and find out the rest,1
part of the movies low rating is the emphasis on unemployment and the suffering we have to endure while this is good for drama in comedy we know the pains it need not be emphasized as a result fun with dick and jane is not an appropriate title and i was just plain disappointed failing to see any fun with dick and jane it is true that this is a copy from the movie of the same name but it fails on the execution and the title was not appropriate for the story linebr br however if the movie was retitled to be the art of the steal and the emphasis on bungling slapstick comedy more takes on the robbery and the plans to steal stupidly of course would have given the movie a major boost while at the same time the movie should show the ceo at least in the beginning to be a crook so it will be easier to project the pains to someone responsible early on and just leave it at that the movie suffers a viewpoint issue and with that in mind a comedy cannot work if the viewpoint is not done properly a scheming husband character who is that of a wile e coyote on the road runner would be more funny including the slapstick comedy but in this case a steal instead of the capture of the bird with complicate contraptions would be extremely funny here i mean you can make many of these and put them in the movie but since the viewpoint was done wrongly the robbery part had to be limitedbr br you will enjoy the movie the first 15 minutes during jim carreys great rise but to make the problems they had to faced to be more comical since it is a comedy that is the part that needs a major overhaul it can be funnier if problems were faced more like john travoltas civil action during the downfall that movie was a serious one but the problems they faced were somewhat comical,0
i cant say i liked this movie very muchit has some amusing momentsbut it doesnt seem able to make up its mind whether it is a comedy or a dramait doesnt really work as eitherits too light in tone to be a dramaand the amusing moments are few and far betweenit also doesnt make a lot of sensethings seem to happen for no reasonand its also extremely convolutedi feel like they just made things up as they were goingif they had just taken a bit of time to explain thingsthis might have been a better moviei would say the ending was anti climatic but that would mean the rest of the movie had actually been building up to somethingwhich it didntit just sorts endsand thats thati didnt find it boringreallybut like i saidthere there just isnt any pointill give winter kills a reluctant and weak 310,0
the film maybe goes a little far but if you love the show its what you expect its not a bad movie its actually pretty good if you dont like the show dont see the movie it starts off a little slow maybe but then picks up and turns out to be pretty funny there are even a few heartwrenching scenes toward the end after all the protagonists have gone through these scences do get to you also jerry throws in his opinion why his show upsets people and justifies his shows existience hes got a pretty good point we care so much about the private details of celebrities lives so why is it wrong that these people tell their private lives on national tv too if they were celebrities we wouldnt mind at all wed eat it up do we not like his guest doing this just because theyre poor white trash and it reminds us that there really is poverty in this world and not just rich glamous movie stars living in a leave it to beaver world,1
the only reason i gave this movie a 2 and not a 1 was because for some reason i felt compelled to finish it out basically i wanted to see if there were going to be any aliens any ufos anything at all suggested by the title of the movie the cover of the movie and the beginning of the movie i was very disappointed to see religion being thrown into the mix the way that it was this could have been used to the movies advantage but i felt instead that the movie was trying to send subliminal messages to me finally how big was this casts wardrobe i became so distracted by the number of different and extremely bright shirts each character had on in every new scene that i began to wonder if this movie wasnt really supposed to be classified under poor comedybr br toe thumbs down,0
clint eastwood plays a wounded union soldier found by a girl from a confederate boarding school and hes taken in and nursed back to health instead of turned over to confederate soldiers seems that the womenfolk at this place have ulterior motives geraldine paige the headmistress justifies not turning him into the confederacy and even passes him off as her cousin of course when the man gets to feeling better he becomes quite the ladys man and is pretty much making the rounds but when he gets busted he really gets busted in fact so badly he gets his leg cut off but its for his own good of course not out of retribution things get carried a bit further though when certain women dont get what they want i havent seen this for years and it still has a certain creepiness to it that by todays standards is still pretty strange not typical eastwood at all if you havent seen this one its worth seeing 8 out of 10,1
take away all parts of the movie that were present day and stick to the flashbacks then you would have had a great story faith and wolfs story and their relationship was the best part diaz and eccleston were wonderful brewster was ponderous to sit through surprised to see blythe danner as mom she was great also look for patrick bergen as the father always like him sleeping with the enemy this is a very hippy save the world kind of film dont care for it much but i recommend seeing it for diazs performance alone she has excellent range and it should be used more eccleston is as always compelling hes wonderful,1
i sit through movies like tiempo de valientes and i want to talk about cinema for hours the admiration this movie caused me is beyond my own limits of explanation because im watching the scenes of the film and i search inside my thoughts for filmmaking ideas and dialogue innovations that could emerge from something bigger than damian szifrons mindbr br looking the environment so uncompromised so simple im thinking this man is a genius no wonder he created what is probably the best television show argentina ever witnessed and then a first movie full of elements some contemporary directors havent still achieved el fondo del mar is the name and it awakened a few years ago my enthusiasm for our everyday cinemabr br starting his journey from peoples daily real lives szifron goes where pablo trapero never could in el bonaerense the federal police departments life traperos film was a journey into a mans mind and experiences not into the places he saw yes there was a detailed training and lots of crime situations but szifron in in there his is more of a detective story like the ones we know and love with the mysteries and the thrilling musicbr br but theres a lot of humanity in his writing and he shows us his investigation through the eyes of his main characters alfredo díaz and mariano silverstein there are a lot of actors of great caliber in the film but these two actors are the ones the film cant do without the first character luis luque is a detective that has just found out his wife cheats on him and has to work on a casebr br the second one is a psychiatrist that is assigned the treatment of the detective he wants to deal with him in regular sessions but the sheriff takes advantage of the time disposition and suggests he joins díaz in his routines its nothing the usual stuff no problem but it is bigger than that and it will unfold a part of the doctors personality he didnt knowbr br the relationship developed between the two leads cant be explained unless it is observed because it regards such a complexity that demonstrates how talented are some men like szifron that are trying today to leave a signature in our history reaching points of unbelievable spontaneity during a high pressure situation díaz tells silverstein how do we continue our treatment and silverstein answers no im not your doctor you call me to have dinner im your friend we laugh because we cant help itbr br and we cant help laughing when díaz crashes a car in the street and doesnt gives importance to it or when he trespasses all the red lights in the street or when he smokes pot in his police patrol and silverstein cant believe it but then smokes it too because hes screwed up or when silverstein tries to be friendly with díazs robber friends magic from diego peretti is what we receive there he a psychiatrist himself gives a performance in plan,1
paul naschy made a great number of horror films in terms of quality they tend to range from fairly good to unwatchable trash and unfortunately horror rises from the tomb is closer to the latter the plot is just your average story of a witch wizard or as is the case here warlock who is put to death but not before swearing vengeance on those who did itetc etc we then get a séance and one thing leads to another and pretty soon the executed warlock is up to no good again the plot is slow painfully boring and the film constantly feels pointless the characters string out reams of diatribe and it never serves the film in any way whatsoever paul naschy wrote the script and if you ask me he should stick to acting because the dialogue is trite in the extreme and only serves to make the film even more boring than it already is carlos aured who also directed naschy in blue eyes of the broken doll and curse of the devil provides dull direction here which likes the dialogue does nothing to help the film sometimes crap films like this have a certain charm about them but horror rises from the tomb doesnt even have that this is a painfully boring film that has little or nothing in the way of interest,0
this relic from before the days of the production code and the hays office is good fun not great but entertainingbr br based on a song by rogers hart that was an enormous hit at the time the story revolves around dance hall girl barbara stanwyck who is romanced by wealthy businessman ricardo cortez who was indecently handsome but whose heart belongs to her bookish neighbor monroe owsley she and owsley marry but keep it a secret while she dismisses cortez who still holds out hope she helps hubby get a job in cortezs company but married bliss quickly turns sour as owsley develops a taste for the high life and steps out with a college sweetheart and gambles in highstakes bridge yup i know its pretty funny finally he embezzles 5000 from cortez and is about to go on the lam when his devoted wife goes to cortezand i wont reveal anything else although the ending was certainly a surprisebr br stanwyck is the best thing about this movie in one of her earliest roles shes quite accomplished owsley is the weak point hes unattractive and sniveling while cortez is amazingly suave and sexy while his performance is earnest but unremarkablebr br while ostensibly a drama its filled with laughs many inadvertant as some elements of this movie have aged very poorly but there are a lot of good witty lines at one point stanwyck says to cortez my brains are in my feet while yours are in thats pretty darn suggestive for 1931 theres a lot of bawdy and suggestive stuff in this flick in the last days before the code clamped down and whitewashed everything an amusing antique a good reminder of how far we havent come in 70 yearsthis story could very easily be changed to fit 2003 but could keep the basic plot with the original ending in place,1
i have this movie on a collection of inexpensive bmovies its not restored in fact the audio was difficult to discern for the first few minutesbr br at first it seemed like a typical haunted house film and feels very much like the forerunner of clue murder by death house on haunted hill etcbr br about a half hour into the film the storyline takes a really interesting twistand it goes from being a cliché melodrama to something entirely different and far more entertaining than i had initially thoughtbr br check it out its a great deal of fun even if the long clips and wider shots and near lack of music score make it feel a bit creaky by todays standards,1
i havent any idea how commentators could regard this as a decent b western or how one commentator said the plot was more cohesive than most nothing could be farther from the truth this movie is one huge nonsequitur it is an affront to the noble b western films of the 30s i have seen many of waynes early lone star and republic westerns and this one is easily the worstbr br the bad guy is known as the shadow for crying out loud initially the shadows scheme is holding up opensided stage coaches simultaneously his gang rustles all of the cattle in the territory then they decide to move on to bank robbery to do this they need to shoot up the town with a machine gun no explanation of why thats necessary or how he got that neato little toybr br no single scheme is revealed in enough detail to suggest a plot here the shadow is obviously just a generally bad guy with all kinds of generally evil schemes br br he imparts his instructions to his gang through a fake wallsafe knockknock whos there he is apparently clairvoyant because whenever his henchmen need to talk to him they knock on the wall the safe opens and presto hes there i can just imagine that he has met them facetoface and saysi have some secret nefarious instructions to give you about our next evil deed meet me at the wallsafe and ill give em to you just why the shadow requires the safe to communicate with his army of outlaws is like most of the elements of this mess never explainedbr br he has a nifty tunnel to the ol hollow stump across the street from which vantage point various of his baddies perform assassinations he also has a hidden panel not in his secret lair behind the fake safe but out in the main roombr br when not behind the safe he hangs out on his cowless ranch masquerading as rancher matlock we learn that he has murdered the true owners of the ranch two brothers and assumed the identity of one the daughter of the dead brother has recently arrived from 1930s nyc judging by her wardrobe and she apparently never met her real uncle because he dupes her toobr br if you thought that bad guys always wore black hats and good guys white hats you need to see this movie here the good guys all ditch their hats in favor of white headbands that make them look like they have all suffered head wounds before any shots have been fired its like a game of pickup basketball only wayne has them tying bandanas round their heads instead of just taking off their shirtsbr br perhaps the weirdest of all is the ending immediately after subduing the shadow and his gang we jump far enough into the future to see wayne and his wife the erstwhile niece on the front porch of their home never mind that there has been scant romance there yak is playing,0
the original grudge the original american remake surprisingly pulled off just about everything you could do right with a ghost flick it had suspense dark and moody atmosphere some good jolts and some genuinely creepy images the grudge 2 attempts all of these techniques but ultimately fails only showing us the same old stuff we saw in the first movie as well as a messy storyline constantly switching from tokyo to california it begins in tokyo with some schoolgirls who wander into the house now heavily blocked by one strip of police tape one of them comes face to face with a similar wideeyed ghost girl while trapped in a closet she gets out screaming frantically and they all run out of there next we cut to america where karens sister is sent by their mother to japan to find and bring her back home we eventually find ourselves following a very familiar concept involving a curious guy and girl investigating the history of a mysterious house we cut back and forth to the girls from the beginning who are disappearing one by one as well as a young boy hearing strange noises in the next apartment at night all leading up to a very unsatisfying ending the scare scenes are dull and ineffective like the ring 2 avoid this god awful sequel,0
this thing works on all levels its intense as a thriller full of lars von trier homages but also very much its own film and it does have a message happiness comes from within best personified in the wounded soldier who practically and believe it or not humorously disintegrates limb by limb throughout the film all the while apologizing to others for imposing on them you laugh at him but you envy him as well the central character is a wellmeaning but clumsy writer who spends the whole film trying to help those he befriends on a train from stockholm to berlin just after world war ii he ties the parallel stories together and really screws people up in the process to say things go wrong is an understatement and structurally the characters are all in perfect opposition to each other its like every one of them has an opposite just so tight like watching antimatter collide you will not believe the sick stuff you end up laughing at to say more would qualify as a spoiler all i can say is it is a shame this film has not been released in the us not even on dvd some moron probably told them americans wouldnt get it which is crap because we not only get but produce things like south park if this film gets marketed in the us it should be sold as a mainstream black comedy because thats what it is overthetop sick and twisted but fuuuuunnnnnyyyyy,1
i accept that most 50s horror arent scary by todays standards but what the hell is this when you see a title like this you expect to see blood and a blood thirsty beast instead we get no blood at all and a beast who either wants to take over the world or live in peace on earthyeah which is what the people wantedbr br the overall story is fine with the astronaut coming back to life and being one with the beastbut the title really kills the movie night of the beast would have made the fans more happy because there really isnt any blood to speak ofbr br i like how the 50s movies had endings that left room for a sequel but wisely never made one this movie isnt the worst ive ever seen but its almost up therebr br 2 out of 10,0
robert mckimsons acrobatty bunny is one of the directors finest shorts although the circusbased setting may evoke hideous memories of mckimsons dreadful big top bunny acrobatty bunny is in fact nowhere near as dull as that travesty pitting bugs bunny against a ferocious lion acrobatty bunny is fresh and funny from the outset not to mention extremely attractive to look at theres a classic scene in which bugs takes a strangled elevator ride out of his hole only to emerge directly into the jaws of the lion in a brilliant disney parody he hollers pinocchio down the lions throat this brilliant opening is a sign of things to come there are some expertly choreographed antics in and around the lions cage to begin with followed by a hilariously grotesque and irritating rendition of laugh clown laugh which as a child i used to impersonate regularly all this culminates in a short acrobatic sequence which gives the cartoon its name ive never been fond of the circus as a setting for cartoons and find it usually makes for a dull and predictable set of gags but acrobatty bunny breaks from the mould and the result is an exhilaratingly funny short which stands amongst mckimsons best,1
this review contains mild spoilers but not enough to spoil the storybr br watched nihon chinbotsu sinking of japan or japan sinks depending on where you live recently a remake of the 1970s movie of the same name which itself was based on sakyo komatsus bestselling novel this movie is a gem of japanese filmmaking it appears that japan is sinking due to a subduction of a tectonic plate to the west the americans predict that it would happen in the period of 40 years but according to drtadokoro a seemingly mad scientist it will happen in less than a year the japanese government isnt that convinced but sets up a disaster evacuation plan as well as form a new d1 team to handle the crisis while on a trip to china to negotiate evacuation plans the japanese prime minister was killed and sends the cabinet into a state of panic the d1 team is left to handle most matters and led by the newly elected minister of crisis management saoro takamori drtadokoros exwife she turns instead to drtadokoro for advice and he has plans to blow astronomically huge holes under japan to avert the process of sinkingbr br japan would soon have to negotiate with various countries and persuade them to adopt japanese refugees soon it seems that a lot of countries are reluctant to accept any more due to the sudden influx of japanese in their country and the chaos that follows if this ever happens touchwood i hope ito misaki will be safe she can always stay at my place hee hee the scenes of evacuations are really well done showing the havoc suffering and desperation civilians have to face in such disastrous times and the many faces of human beings surface arrogance selfishness bribery bravery cowardrybr br this is a really wellmade film the storytelling is solid with an engaging storyline and wonderful acting drtadokoro played by toyokawa etsushi was done really well portraying a divorced and often mad scientist who kicks and bashes up stuff his frustration and concerns were very visible and thats a really good thing reiko played by gorgeous shibasaki kou was also played rather well and has the most memorable line in the entire movie go watch it to find out and i fancy that she has a nice acting voice she plays the love interest of toshio onodera played by tsuyoshi kusanagi of smap oh i almost forgot she has really really long hair and theres also a subtle but background love story which is well written and if theres something the japanese do really well its love storiesbr br one thing that makes this movie interesting is the technical explanations of the events that occur and if youre interested in geography youll have a really good time i know i did hehe i can see that they went to great lengths to make this movies theory believable and the first few graphical displays and explanation were done rather well although youll have to excuse the japaneses famous engrishbr br ok now,1
this was one of the few shows that my wife and i agreed on watching i was upset to hear that it was canceled especially because i didnt realize the ratings were so poor as far as i knew it was doing very well with a lot of viewers almost all my friends and most of the people i spoke to watched the show now we are stuck watching either crappy shows or dvds how bad was the show doing does anyone know the real results of the shows viewings i know that when it went to thursdays it was more difficult for me to catch thank gd for dvrs br br anyways this was a real surprise to know that there will be no more the war at home if any other networks see this please pick up the show please,1
this is john waters best film to date the characters are obvious and symbolic just as in his other films so there are no surprises or character changes i enjoyed the film because of the wittiness and pace of the story it was good storytelling with honest people,1
curiously season 6 of the columbo series contained only three episodes and there is very little evidence of quality in at least two of the scripts based on this outing for the maninthemac and also fade into murderbr br furthermore it is not a coincidence that peter s feibleman penned both the aforementioned scripts incidentally he plays the part of the murdered security guard herebr br this adventure is very rarely compelling and many of the performers just look disinterested with the material the story is rather weakly developed with some protracted periods of boring conversationbr br columbo is also shadowed by a colleague heresimilar to last salute to the commodore but the entertainment value is minimal to add to this celestes holm characterisation which is intended to provide comedy induces embarrassment rather than laughsbr br the script wavers off to deal with the family history and the murderess does enough to gift columbo the case though there is never a credible discussion relating to the motives of her crimebr br ironically what turns out to be arguably columbos worst adventure produces the funniest moment in the series he quizzes a male hairdresser and has a haircutmanicure at the same time the next 5 minutes are hilarious its just that columbos hair is so perfectly groomed then he cant afford to pay the bill and then when he makes enquiries at a jewellers he keeps glancing in the mirror to admire his hairstylebr br sadly this is the only decent moment from a script that looks like it has been cobbled together in ten minutes br br for columbo completionists only,0

moonstruck is a movie that i liked the first time i watched it i really liked it the second time i loved it the third time now it is one of my all time favoritesbr br the humor is subtle but really good the film offers a lot of warmth humor the story takes place in a old school italian neighborhood in nyc chers search for love is enjoyable to watch this film is by far the best job nicholas cage has done on film the old man character is fantastic he lights up the screen without saying a word the scene with his dogs howling at the moon was fantastic but perhaps the best character is the one played by olympia dukakisbr br the films climax is a scene where the main characters have it out over a breakfast of oatmeal in the family kitchen exceptional direction and wrap up,1
one of the most successful shows in television history is back now i admit i never got into the original show okay so i never watched it at all but the new show is impressivebr br scifi has premiered the first two episodes rose and the end of the world this weekend we meet rose a twentysomething clerk who is chased by remote controlled mannequins she is rescued by a mysterious stranger who calls himself the doctor using the internet she finds a conspiracy buff who warns her that wherever the doctor goes death follows when her geeky boyfriend mickey is replaced by an impostor the doctor informs her of a plot to use earth as a breeding ground for more of these plastic monsters whom the doctor has been fighting across space and time traveling in a tardis disguised a 50sstyle police call boxbr br she helps him save the worldthere wouldnt be a show otherwiseand decides to join him but when he puts her life in danger he is distraught and questions whether her company was worth the riskbr br although the special effects are kinda lame and the some of the scenes are a bit choppy doctor who is after two episodes aired in the us a smart wellwritten work apparently the second season has already aired in the uk so i predict the same success here,1
this movie is bad news and im really surprised at the level of big name talent who would ever agree to appear in such a piece of junk as this i imagine there were a few strangled agents sprawled across hollywood blvd as a result of this fiasco what really gets you is that it could have been good the directors star appeal and the subject matter was sufficient fodder to spark interest and ticket sales but this is a flop the multiple story lines all go from bad to silly by the pictures end and you end up feeling like a mouse in a maze looking for a piece of cheese that turns out to be rotten what spike is able to achieve is revenge against any italians who may have beat him up when he was a kid or insulted him as the movie does quite a number on perpetuating outdated and probably offensive italian stereotypes as with any spike lee film there is some really thought provoking and magical camerawork he does have the gift of grabbing your psyche and transporting you into his vision if only for a few memorable scenes but the question remainscan you endure the other 2 hours of head scratching and clock watching as you wonder and wait for the ending that has to be there somewhere,0
kpax is exactly what a heart warming film should be the story is about a mysterious mental patient prot played by kevin spacey and his unbelieving psychiatrist dr powel played by jeff bridges the two have a very friendly bond and as their relationship grows dr powel cant help but wonder whether or not there is more to his mysterious patient who insists he is from another planet called kpax this film is very funny and kevin spacey pulls of well placed one liners as if it was his second nature kpax is a smart film and i wasnt expecting it to go where it did in the end i found myself thinking about the small things in life and the wonder and magic of the every day life we so often take for granted i left the theater with a warm fuzzy feeling inside and for families and couples on a date kpax is a splendid film that will not disappoint i highly recommend this film to anyone interested in something more than the monotonous releases of glossy action packed gore fests,1
yknow its very interesting watching this half the people involved with it are now deadbr br anyways its been a long time since ive watched anything muppet related but this stuff is pure gold im a great fan of puns and this movie has them quite well placed but one of the amazing aspects of it is its pacing its not really highspeed childrens pacing where the filmmakers just randomly decide to move the story along without giving the characters depth its just kind of moves along with the characters wherever they want to gobr br kermit the frog is just an awesome character his voice and the expressions on his puppetface are fantastic but above all he points out why hes popularhe can sing and make jokes toobut more appropriately why hes so endearinghe without any effort inspires everyone to search for their dreams in the meantime he also has to deal with himself which is an uncommon theme in family moviesbr br it also contains quite an ensemble of comedians making appearances here and there some to great effect others to a little less i think mel brooks part was just a bit overplayed do you some parts of the film are just kind of odd but its highly imaginative and takes itself to the same destination from a very different directionbr br moving right alongbr br polarisdib,1
the five deadly venoms is a great kungfu action movie wrapped in a whodunnit mystery there are all the usual telltale signs of a kungfu flick great choreography awful dubbing different styles of fighting and a wide range of greatly exaggerated often cheesey human emotions however the plot certainly is better than average its interesting and holds your attention throughout the nonfight scenes occasionally its even able to fire up the audience such as when x character receives horrible injusticebr br another thing i love about the five deadly venoms is the beautiful simplicity of the movies morals and themes just about everyone gets whats coming to them the cowardly greedy and corrupt lose out the bad guys consumed by selfish greed are ultimately destroyed by their own treachery and backstabbing the good guys use teamwork planning and integrity to overcome the odds and come out on top br br poison clan rocks,1
um hello rainbow brite the name alone is hard to take it seriously like she could be the cousin of strawberry shortcake but when youre a kid this is definitely serious stuffbr br so theres this vile snotty spoiled girl and she wants rainbow brites belt amongst other things ie the light of the whole universe and rainbow brite and her friend cris are bound and determined to stop her as i remember murky and lurky had a minor role in this production maybe they wanted too much moneybr br so anyway snotty evil girl has a powerful jewel and she channels its power to take rainbows belt imagine but somehow rainbow gets her belt back and reenergizes it with star sprinkles and kicks the bad girls butt with the help of cris and his prism bracelet and they also save the whole universe in the processbr br so good triumphs over evil niceness triumphs over rudeness and rainbow brite and the color kids are once again safe to spread color and joy for all mankind,1
most of the comments so far have nailed this one right on the head viewers under a certain age and with iqs of three digits should avoid chance of a lifetime like a george wbush appointee facing a congressional grillingbr br the cast is composed largely of veterans who know their way around a wellwritten script is the premise wildly original no but the movie stands out like a lighthouse at midnight in the current and nonending glut of moviestv geared to the mostdesirable audience demographic of teenagers and young adultsbr br in addition to betty white and leslie neilsen in the leads the cast also has everreliable veterans like elaine stritch and william windom the sharp dialog is effortlessly and effectively delivered by these prosbr br chance of a lifetime is definitely not a movie for the will ferrelladam sandlersaw slasher gorefests american eye dull and ninety percent of the rest of the sludge ground out by hollywood and tv,1
not bad but could be loads better also seems to follow a staple diet for crime drama youve got sandra bullock as the cop who finds it difficult to work with others youve got her placed with a new partner theres a closed case but a cop who works on it anyway and theres so many corney lines in the film it makes you want to screambr br however if you can look past the formulaic elements there is a good film hiding underneath its gripping and the subplots worked for me well worth a rent but maybe not a purchase,1
so prom night was supposed to be a horror and thriller movie im a big wuss and was scared to see this movie at the beginning but upon seeing it it is neither horror or thrillerbr br i was basically making fun of the movie in my seat because it was so predictable you could predict what was going to happen next the young actors were alright at playing their characters but id have to say the killer was definitely at the top of the game acting wisebr br yes ill give props for the plot because it was good but its not thrilling or scary there were almost zero jumpinyourseat scenes so dont waste ten dollars seeing it in theatres wait til it comes to dvd,0
airplane apart i dont think ive ever laughed at a film so much in all my lifebr br i love football like mad but i tend to hate almost any song or film about football as they tend to be unrealistic this wasntbr br i watched it once it was over 2 years ago it was brilliant everyone i know loved it i remember the gay physio the sloping pitch at about a 45 degree angle and shoes a player so named because he once turned up for training in a new pair of shoes brilliant thats what goes on in park footballbr br a definite 1010 if anyone from the tv industry is reading this considering all the crap you repeat on english tele please have the sense to show this again and the muppets while youre at it also does anyone know if this was shown on bbc or itv i think it was itv so its worth asking them if they plan to show it again they should do,1
i found the movie very interesting i really enjoyed the film the actors were great it was entertainment benny the uncle was wonderful he was real at his character the ending took a wonderful twist i would recommend you seeing it eddie mores girlfriend reminded me a little of sandra bullock she was sharp as a nail i also like the little girls acting in the movie she was very convincing benny reminded me of a friend of mine who really lives his life growing up in brooklyn i loved the scene where he tasted the sauce in the pot because thats how most people cook lol i actually watched the movie 2 times and learned more the second time,1
sir arthur conan doyle wrote a fair number of sherlock holmes accounts but the popularity of the famous detective insured that sequels in both print and on film would extend far beyond the authors worksbr br in sherlock holmes and the secret weapon holmes basil rathbone patriotically serves british intelligence in order to secure a swiss scientists desperately needed bombsight the film is from 1942 and i wonder if the producers and writers realized how vital bombsight secrets were the american norden bombsight was guarded almost as zealously as the new radar sets that would change the course of world war iibr br holmes and his faithful but expectedly bumbling companion dr watson nigel bruce battle dr moriarty lionel atwill as evil as moriarty has always been its a bit of a shock to see hes signed up with hitler has the man no vestige of decency i guess not but atwill is deliciously evilbr br the story is reasonably fastpaced as holmes and watson seek to recover stolen bombsight components before they can be delivered to a uboat rathbone is his usual suave self and several holmsian disguises are well carried outbr br this and other 1940s holmes stories are now available on dvd and oldiescom has put out a very nice fourdisc set in a wooden box this film is included along with a bonus cd of an interview with the aged doyle the set retails for about 26 in major dvd and cd stores but i found this and other sets from oldiescom at a warehouse club for 1498 the transfers are very goodbr br very nice and relaxing late night viewingbr br 710,1
a lot of alternative comedy in britain in the 1980s was insular misguided overlypolitical and unfunny and the worst of the comic strip presents stuff fell into this categorybr br but this is at the other end a remarkable film that works on different intellectual levelsbr br is dennis a criminal mastermind or is he lyingbr br is he telling the truth bluffing doublebluffing counterdoublybubblybluffingwhateverbr br ive probably watched supergrass 20 or 30 times and i still cant decide 100 thats the wonderful thingbr br as well as ade edmonson there are big roles for other early comic strip mainstays french saunders pete richardson alexei sayle keith allen nigel planer and robbie coltrane though curiously enough not rik mayallbr br all of the comic strip cast however much i disliked the hidden agenda of some of their members are convincing actors and turn in superb performances in this bigscreen outing while the richardsonrichens writing teams work is so often pure genius with nice little touches of detail throughoutbr br ultimately this is a study of crime criminology and human nature in all its wondrous complexity and very funny with it you will not be disappointed,1
if you read the book before seeing the movie you may be disappointed like i was the book was great and i was sure after seeing the movie preview that the movie would be great as well however i felt like i was watching a movie where the director and cast did not even read what these characters where like the movie is short and they do not really ever make us feel that these people were truly in love and felt like sole mates even if the movie did not go in the same direction as the book at least they could of made the romance between these two characters feel more intense i think both diane lane and richard gere were perfect for these two characters and they have good chemistry however they just did not develop a long enough storyline for us to see how they longed for each other the book was true love story and i think this movie could of been a lot better,0
the subject of children being terminally ill is difficult and saddening but the cure successfully portrays the idea that it doesnt have to be all doom and gloom and if anything children need to have hope and delight in their lives if they are to find peace before the end it is also a film of remarkable bonds of friendship and the innocence of childhoodbr br the film sees erik a dysfunctional adolescent boy with a distant mother moving into a new area where their nextdoor neighbour is elevenyearold dexter who contracted aids through a blood transfusion after his initial fears and ignorance over aids are allayed erik befriends dexter and their almost fraternal friendship sees them embark on a journey down the mississippi to where they have heard about a new orleans doctor who claims to have found a cure for the diseasebr br the talent from the two young leads of brad renfro and joseph mazzello who play erik and dexter respectively is exceptional brad was able to portray eriks harder edge without comprising the subtle childish innocence inherent to the character while joseph depicts the sense of vulnerability to dexters character but injects the right amount of boyish enthusiasm and zeal to highlight that his illness doesnt mean he still isnt a child who wants to run and play like any other elevenyearold boy the pairs interactions create a feel in the audience that these are two boys who are genuinely close and they carry the film well annabella sciorra also delivers a touching performance as dexters mother linda who adores her son and delights in seeing him thrive with this new friendship to erik and eventually becomes a surrogate motherfigure to the other boybr br set against an excellent soundtrack the cure is a very bittersweet film that manages to flawlessly weave the story of boyhood friendship that survives unflinchingly in the midst of prejudice and terminal illness without resorting to sappiness or unnecessary saccharine sweet scenes a very interesting reflection in the film is that is it the adults who have the problem with dexters aids status whereas the children even the bullies come to accept him as they would any other what is also very touching is how despite eriks streetwise nature he is the more naive one in his determination to cure dexter while the younger boy has this haunting sense that he knows his fate but is swept away by his best friends enthusiasm for a curebr br i highly recommend the cure for it is rare to find a film that is simultaneously sad and uplifting,1
im not sure why there are no articles or posters or anything about this film because i just saw it and thought it was awesome i guess its not for everyone because its basically kafkas the trial meets beevis and butthead which is a pretty tough combination to swallow still i thought it was great if youre going to see it because you want a sequel to office space youre probably going to be disappointed but if you want to see one of the most brutal acidtongued and hilariously honest looks at where our society is headed youre in for a treat i just saw the 8pm show opening night in los angeles and there were only 12 people in the theater which means the film will probably be gone in a week thats really a shame because in its own way idiocracy is one of the best satires to come along in quite a while but then again its basically making fun of the people who make up about 99 of the moviegoing audience so i guess its no wonder the studio panicked and tried to dump it,1
this is the worst movie i have ever seen the avengers held this dubious honor but no longer the acting in jill the ripper is terrible and was only eclipsed by the plot this movie is as intellectually stimulating as the telletubbes it doesnt know whether it wants to be an sm flick or a really bad thriller only watch under extreme intoxication or if youre bed ridden and need a leather clad distraction this script should be reworked into a porn it wouldnt take very much effort and would have a longer shelf life a porn even a bad porn wouldnt do the damage to dolf lundgrens career the way that this movie has,0
just imagine the real hitler who was a master of propaganda and speech would have been such a mumbling moron as carlyle portrayed him in this filmbr br nobody would have followed him not even a desperate unemployed guy in the 1920sbr br this is just a hollywood cardboard piece of propaganda itself disguised as true historybr br i pity everyone who actually believed anything from this show carlyle and the producers didnt get anything right with thisbr br why was hitler able to win so many people a whole county for his ideas if we was such a sausage why did people follow him to death by portraying him as such a loser they make their own film totally unbelievable this film is a mixture of old ww2 propaganda and mtv urban myths about one of the most important persons of the last century imagine a film about churchill where the director only shows him as a drunkard for 90 mins br br this film is a disgrace and i wonder how they could talk an actor like carlyle into this dreck,0
this is an incredibly fun actionexploitation 80s rocker charles bronson rules as paul kirsey the villains are hilariously bad the soundtrack by jimmy page is laughably bad alex winter bill of bill ted is great as one of the street punks who gets wasted by bronson and crew crew oh those are the downtrodden townsfolk who team up with bronson to win back the streets the whole movie is enjoyable with the last half hour or so exploding into nonstop action and mayhem 910,1
to say that thunderbirds is a horrid forced inyourface ugly looking nasty to listen to and painful to watch film wouldnt be saying enough there are only two reasons i can think of why youd watch this film 1 youve seen thunderbirds when you were young like i did and are curious as to what it is like but you will really only be watching to find out how badly they screwed things up or 2 youre seeing it with someone under ten years oldbr br thunderbirds manages to cock up everything it attempts the list goes on and on but there are other more subtle humiliating things that are painfully obvious when you think about it from the off thunderbirds is wrong wrong wrong the whole moral message and goal is set up in an excruciating way jeff tracy a new low for bill paxton tells his youngest son alan hes not yet proved himself to be a thunderbird after alan randomly and stupidly decided to go down into tracy islands bowels to fire up thunderbird one the whole film is then a series of events and missfires consisting of alan trying to prove himself whilst his father and other brothers are trapped in space aboard thunderbird fivebr br the film relies on kid actors to carry the film a 16 year old alan tracy corbet a 16 year old tin tin hudgens and a 14 year old fermat fulton who is brains son to say that watching the adventures they get up to is painful is an understatement frequently trying to act and utilise the script whilst combating the evil hood kingsley in ridiculously unfunny and hammy ways acts as the entertainment for the duration of the film it only differs when everyones in a different location also the whole mind control thing was very tiresome and basically dragged the film down as it was overused and offered a way for our heroes to see a weakness in the hood forced and incidentalbr br i know that most films for kids these days try to integrate some sort of material for adults but in thunderbirds its done in a way that fetishises lady penelope sophia myles plays penelope and i think its no coincidence shes a little older than the rest of the kids at 24 years old its almost too good to be true her scenes are often highly charged and carry an erotic push we see her in the bath bubbles up to her neck watching tv in comes her butler and sneaks a peek as she seductively changes channels with her wet bare and bubble covered foot frequent shots of her massive bright pink high heeled shoes filling the screen during various scenes this first happens when she is actually tied up with the second happening during a fist fight with another woman twinned with this her bright pink costumes that reveal just enough yet cover just enough are particularly outstanding as is the way she moves and talks with that posh dominant english accent sounding like,0
the film is visually stunning from the dusty interior of the church with the lighted stove through the drizzly street and the rundown garage to the blaze that is the climax of the film it also has a wonderful sense of time both 1950s the films opening and 1960s all of the performances are topclass especially mathew macfadyen as the psychotic preacher and gerard mcsorley as the father who finds his own intolerance terrifyingly magnified by his son what a pity then that the story is so ridiculous for a start in concentrating on the relationship between gabriel mcfadyen and his family it utterly fails to show how he has managed to hold so much influence on the community in the church we see five or six of the main characters at the front and another two or three at the back but the rest of the congregation might as well be mannequins they show no sign of hearing him heeding him or dissenting from him at the cockfight nobody says yea or nay when he disrupts the proceedings but neither does anybody applaud or condemn when caroline throws a pint over him a situation that results in a stone thrown through the pub window is mysteriously resolved by the onset of labour pains secondly middletown which isnt actually a town but a tiny village seems to lack some essential services such as police and fire service murder can only be dealt with by a family member with a crowbar residents watch an inferno that threatens to engulf the whole town as though they were at the cinema for that matter everyday things such as telephones and newspapers are conspicuously absent the rural community is strangely devoid of farm animals or wheatfields and most puzzling of all for a typical north of ireland setting there is only one christian community not even a couple of anglicans to season the mix even if youre willing to suspend disbelief the story itself is pretty threadbare a pale imitation of an aj cronin melodrama and the music well its beautiful for the first two minutes but when the same four chords are repeated nonstop for 90 minutes it gets more than a little irritating my advice watch this with the sound off,0
may contain spoilers but of course it does not matter br br battleship potemkin is one stunning spectacle of haunting images the visual direction is well and has been inspiring the sheer scale of the film is impressive and the technique is certainly pioneering what is really amazing is to my mind the depth and effectiveness of a film devoid of proper literary script sound save the soundtrack decent image quality the fauxprofound selfreferentialism of today exceptional acting pretense etc what you get is a purely visual experience to be rememberedbr br btw the previous poster noted eisenstien felt after a lot of suffering to give the heroes what they wanted the problem is that you think eisenstein is building up to a big final fight and then he tricks you its a little cheap i wouldve rather seen a huge final action scenebr br i must warn you that the end is not cheap and eisenstein wasnt being generous to the heroes history however was potemkin really did go through the squadron as it was shown in the filmbr br finally id strongly recommend seeing battleship potemkin to anyone more or less seriously interested in cinema see it with a fellow movie buff it kept me talking for hours however if you tend to consider films generally accepted as great or classic to be slow or boring this film might not be for you yet not much cheap entertainment herebr br for me though it is a full 1010,1
steven segals movie career is a tribute to horrible cinema i have been tragically bored with every one of them as soon as i realized that they were even more unrealistic than jean claude vandammes has anyone else ever noticed that he never gets hit i mean give me something to root fora hard fought battle with a bad guy whos scary twenty years and hes still filming the same fight scenes fight scenes can often distract you from the fact that your hero cannot act the boring choreography of a segal film places his painful lack of acting skill in sharp relief worse yet hes woefully out of shape just what we need a fat stiff who thinks hes a leading man theres not one iota of redeeming cinematic value in all this movies ninety or so minutes do not watch this unless you feel like throwing away an hour and a half of your life,0
if you need a clue as to whether playmaker is decent or not look to its star colin firth who refers to it in an interview as absolute rubbish i sincerely hope no one ever sees itbr br the script and plot are ludicrous the female lead is unconvincing the only thing worthwhile is colin firth and he seems slightly embarrassed throughoutbr br for diehard firth fans only the shower scene alone is worth the 399 you might have to shell out should you find it in a video cutout bin like i didbr br im happy for mr firth that his days of taking projects like this one are over,0
the cast and crew of this cheap horror potboiler are more interesting than anything that occurs throughout the movie itself we have barbara payton raymond burr lon chaney jr tom conway paul cavanaugh and woody strode in front of the camera and writerdirector curt siodmak cinematographer charles van enger editorial supervisor francis d lyon and production assistant herman cohen behind it the illfated payton turns the head of virtually every male she comes in contact with deep in the african jungle where she lives on husband cavanaughs plantation doctor conway secretly desires her while hotheaded foreman burrs approach is quite literally more handson on the other hand chaney is surprisingly enough the laidback but knowing authoritarian figure and strode is a native police official the plot is very simple but frankly does not make a whole lot of sense after a particularly agitated dinner complete with thunderstorm burr and cavanaugh art imitating life more on that later come to blows in the garden over their affection for payton and conveniently for burr a large snake just happens to be crawling near where cavanaugh hits the ground witnessing the event from behind the bushes paytons enigmatic maid a native witch no less for some inexplicable reason puts a curse on burr who has in the meantime married payton that periodically turns him into a gorillastarting from his very wedding day when his hand briefly turns hirsute consequently burr takes to losing himself in the jungle for days on end even if the ape creature itself is barely glimpsed throughout the film it must be said however that the version that i watched ran for just 56 minutes when the official length is elsewhere given as either 66 70 or 76 therefore the film feels understandably rushed and disjointed if never less than campily enjoyable as it culminates in the gorillas subjectivelyshot chasing of payton in the jungle with the former being itself pursued by the guntoting chaney and conway to get back to the films tragic blonde leading lady for a minute after a promising start in movies next to such hollywood legends as james cagney and gary cooper in respectively kiss tomorrow goodbye and dallas both 1950 her career soon nosedived into b and lesser grade territory thanks to her own colorful offscreen antics her most notorious misdemeanor was being the cause of a muchpublicized barroom brawl between suave husband franchot tone and brutish former lover tom neal which ended with the former in a coma and payton actually deserting him for the latter shortly thereafter but that was not all nymphomaniac payton also boasted that woody strode was among her conquests a controversial issue at the time shortlived husband tone having caught paytons infidelities on camera spread the damning photographic evidence around hollywood and this virtually served to end her days as a starlet her last film appearance being edgar g ulmers murder is my beat 1955 which i happen to have in my unwatched movies pile the last 12 years of her tumultuous life were spent on skid row in,0
this film has all the earmarks of too many cooks spoiling the stew based on shielah grahams autobiography it seems like the powers that be couldnt leave well enough alone they couldnt decide if this was to be grahams story or fitzgeralds story and also how much they should softpedal whoevers story it turned out to be so a film that could have been a story about two fascinating fitzgerald and notorious ms grahampersonalities becomes a dreary disjointed soap opera about that tells us little about either added to this there is absolutely no period feel other than for 1959 clumsy scene follows clumsy scene and we have no idea where we are in the story or how much time is passing however and this saved the film for me kerr has never looked lovelier and peck is as always a very handsome man they truly make a beautiful mature couple and i only wish they had better material to work with there is one scene that does work scott goes after shielah while in a drunken state and to see these two normally refined stars knock each other around is very disturbing and gives some fleeting idea of what goes on in a relationship such as theirs other than that the movie is a wasted opportunity and achieves nowhere near the classic stature of other wald produced soaps of the 1950 peyton place the best of everything,0
i do not watch much television and came across this show reality show i sure hope this is not for real if i was a man and had such a nag and was married to someone so snotty it would be grounds for divorce i think she sets a bad example of how a person should treat a person they love that is one thing that is wrong with our world now so many people in bad relationships selfish and do not know the meaning of what it is to truly love another it is self sacrificing and not something that should be on merritt that does not give one a very good feeling to watch what should be in private counseling if his personality on the show is for real then he deserves someone much better that would show real true love and care for him and appreciate him for who he is is this show a reality or made up for ratings i really would like to know sincerely gb,0
this has to be the worst movie ive seen this year and i watch a lot of cable the plot is just ridiculous the scenes are just thrown at you with no action no start or ending of any scene its just random idiots with makeup that scream in some plane the special effects spielberg would laugh his ass off are horrible the yellow eye contact lenses are cute though i have to admin that i couldnt bear to watch it to the end the scene where the great scientist bennett was holding for dear life by the engine body was too much for me im sorry for my bad english i am from romania and this is my first post i had to sign up just to make a comment on this movie because i just cant believe that this is a movie released in 2007,0
almost a twoperson play and as such the dialog and the performances of the leads will be important neither are particularly good this might have been stronger in fact if it had first been crafted as a twoperson play and then worked into a filmbr br anyway a twitchy vampire who seems slightly autistic becomes infatuated with a stripper as a result of watching too much porn in his crappy home he wants to have her tell him about the daylight he would have been better off finding someone with a day job or someone who excels at painting a picture with words like a poet but then they might not have a hot bodbr br after he gets her to do whatever he wants and hes not terribly good at it he intends to feed on her at 6 am at which point the sun rises much is made of that deadline despite the fact that he also says that he can go without feeding it will just make him hungrier additionally he claims he cant let the stripper go since she knows about him but he lets a number of other people go who learn what he is there are a lot of inconsistenciesbr br why this vampire chooses to live in a house so poorly boarded up that light from streetlamps and neighboring buildings pours in as if it were daytime im not sure with all the time in the world youd think hed have done a better job or fixed the place up a bit hes clearly not a wealthy vampirebr br this is supposedly a remake and im curious to see the original version of this dance of the damned although that was directed by katt shea and the other films she directed for corman stripped to kill stk ii were pretty bad,0
the human tornado is a campy 70s blaxploitation movie starring nightclub comedian rudy ray moore in perhaps his most endearing role to date the movie tells the tale of dolemite a bad ass pimpin hustler who gets on the wrong side of a white racist sheriff by sleeping with his wife dolemite barely escapes and journeys to sunny california to visit an old friend a nightclub owner and madam to dolemites ladies named queen bee however it seems that a rival nightclub owner with mob connections is trying to muscle in on her racket so dolemite takes matters into his own hands rudy ray moore showcases many diverse talents in this landmark film including strong dramatic skills a mastery of kung fu an impressive singing voice he provides two of the songs on the soundtrack a touching compassionate side with the ladies and an overall compelling charisma and keen sense of comic timing this film has it all people a deep plot blistering action laughaminute comedy beautiful women in distress a slambang endingwhat more could you ask from a movie run dont walk to your local video store and rent the human tornado today and be sure to share it with your family,1
and i actually gave it a zero on my personal 110 scale i have been attending movies since 1952 and have seen well over 1000 in the theater i dont rate movies that i see only on tv this is the only movie i have ever rated zerobr br my wife and i took our four children then aged 15 11 8 and 6 and even the kids thought it was terrible in fact it was my daughter now 26 who alerted me to this site amazed that the movie was getting an overall rating of 4br br the animation of the dinosaurs looked amateurish at the time and is even worse in retrospect the acting particularly by sean young is atrocious and the story line is simply sillybr br,0
the family happiness is crumbling when the from the beginning rich father ward michael ontkean gets poor and cannot support the family any longer then the mother faye jaclyn smith has to take the role as the breadwinner in the family and starts to work in order to support the family and at the same time periodically alone has to manage the family life not always that good but as good as she can the family life hardly gets easier when the father learns that the son lionel joe flanigan stargate atlantis is gay and is living together with his lover john joel gretsch the 4400 also an old family friend resulting in that the father makes clear to lionel that he is no longer welcome in the family lionel is the one who meant the most to his sister anne leslie horan during her upbringing since the family neglected her anne cannot stand the fact that their father have cut the cords with lionel and therefore she run away from home as this wasnt enough the son greg brian krause charmed enlists in the marines and is sent to war the storyline in this film can on some occasions feel a bit thin in spite of that it still has a lot of realism in it which makes it well worth seeing since this film illustrates many sensitive relations and situations i would believe that it is best appreciated by a mature audience even though it wouldnt hurt for teenagers to see it and get something to think about before adulthood,1
pere is an idiot but he is aware about it and acts in consequence his life is totally boring and he doesnt know how to change it when his last friend nicco dies he feels totally empty and he decides to go out to become drunk when he is returning home he crashes with a girl that puts advertisements although she ignores him he fells in love and starts to follow her obsessively well the beginning of the film is a bit slow and can result boring for most people however as action begins it is a little better not much maybe the best part is the 5 minutes of sex almost 30 different scenes about it that you can see in the middle of the movie it is not good for the erothism but for the funny and unexpected that is the scene probably it is the best of the film neither the actors nor the directing is good and the results is a boring film that that can result funny for some people not for me all the film is based on absurd situations idiot as the film says that have anything interesting i like ventura pons but i have to admit that this is not one of his best films maybe his worst he knows to do it better,0
les visiteurs the first movie about the medieval time travelers was actually funny i like jean reno as an actor but there was more there were unexpected twists funny situations and of course plain absurdness that would remind you a little bit of louis de funesbr br now this sequel has the same characters the same actors in great part and the same time traveling the plot changes a little since the characters now are supposed to be experienced time travelers so they jump up and down in history without paying any attention to the fact that it keeps getting absurder as you advance in the movie the duke jean reno tries to keep the whole thing together with his playing but his character has been emptied so theres not a lot he can do to save the filmbr br now the dukes slavehelper he has really all the attention the movie is merely about him and his being clumsy annoying stupid or whatever he was supposed to be fact is this character tries to produce the laughter from the audience but he does not succeed it is as if someone was telling you a really very very bad joke you already know but he insists on telling that joke till the end adding details to make your suffering a little longerbr br if you liked les visiteurs do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel if you didnt like les visiteurs you would never consider seeing the sequel if you liked this sequel well i suppose you still need to see a lot of movies,0
a made for television version of the heart of darkness seemed like a good way to add more insight to the book well that was the wrong assumption the movie made it even worse i was highly disappointed about almost everything in the movie i hoped that the movie would possibly help put the pieces of the book together that i didnt comprehend but it did no such thing it still left me confused and hanging it is one of those movies that makes one feel like it would be more fun to watch the grass grow instead of watching the movie not exactly anyones cup of tea it was an overall dreadful boring and slow moviebr br to begin with nicolas roeg must have been pretty desperate when he decided that he wanted to undertake the task of making the already boring book into a movie its a guaranteed loss its like going into a knife fight but forgetting the knife on the kitchen counter the knifeless person is going to lose and in the case the knifeless person was roeg all ive heard about the movie are bad things and the movie deserves those bad things to be said about it from watching the movie i got the impression that the people who made the movie just skimmed over the book to get the key pointsbr br furthermore although the movie did follow the main story line of the book it left out quite a few details and it also changed the ending i am not a fan of that roeg left out when marlow and his crew came across the russian sailors camp and at that camp they found the book also it didnt show when at the camp they came across the sign that says wood for you hurry up approach cautiously conrad 110 also at the end of the book kurtz dies on the boat not at the inner stationbr br on the contrary nicolas roeg did one good thing while he was making his movie he managed to hire some pretty decent actors to play in the movie for instance he acquired tim roth and john malkovich both of whom would later go on to have successful careers in doing so he added a little something to the horrible movie also though i am ripping his book to shreds i do have some respect for him because it takes a lot of courage to try to take on the heart of darkness it isnt exactly the easiest novel to portray into a film twus a valiant effort though in conclusion if for whatever reason someone actually wants to watch this movie i suggest the reading of heart of darkness first this way youll get all of the scenes that were left out of the movie and you wont be completely lost when you watch it but i really suggest you dont read the book and that you really dont watch the movie both will be a complete waste of your time trust me i was forced,0
if you are a catalan nationalist anarchosocialist with unnuanced reverence for the mythologies of the spanish republic this movie may be for you two brothers reallife ones one of them being marc recha himself reenact a fictional version of a reallife journey they had made through the spectacular catalan countryside and history is evoked pans of bulletholed walls artillery booms on the soundtrack but not shown there is very little dialog and most of it is incidental the story is told in a thirdperson voiceover the voice being that of an actress impersonating the reallife sister of the reallife brothers the images have little to do with what story line there is which isnt much many are stunning brooding pans across stark semiarid mountains and rivers think terrence malick or gus van sant theres not a little of both gerry and last days here interspersed with some stunning still images and motionless frames these are best enjoyed within the films superb natural sound environment and without the ultimately tedious narration or even the occasional background music some quite good some rather odd but all gratuitous the best of what this movie has to say is said in these sequences with their occasional commentless inclusion of power stations and damsbr br the relationship between the brothers is left sketchy and generic a major character is a manbiting catfish never shown the more the catalanonationalist anarchowhateverist commitments of the director are suggested the more the films richer unspoken message is subverted and the more irritatingly narcissistic the experience becomes though the director said at the nyff screening that the film was conceived from the beginning with its thirdperson narrative id like to see a version of it without the narrative or the music and with only the natural soundtrack and minimalist dialog the result might be more moving and would in any case not be that much less bafflingbr br meantime this is most likely the only film you will see this year in which a guy strides into the frame with a cloth object the bathing suit he had been wearing dangling from his penis this is one of the few moments in the whole movie in which your interest is sorry pricked by something thats actually happening on screen what is that whys it hanging there but as usual no answers are provided very warholian very sixties and a not a little tiresome,0
we all know what chanwook park can do if you havent seen oldboyor the sympathy trilogy for that matter you are missing out on some of the best films made this century but im not here to talk about them im here to talk about thirstbr br this movie is not what you would expect yes it is a vampire movie but at the same time it is also a very twisted tale of romance between a priest and a young girl i wont get into the synopsisyou can read that above but instead tell you what this movie has to offer chanwook park is a master of cinematography and this movie is no exception with some very surreal scenes backed by intense lighting he sets the mood perfectly in almost every scene the movie does start a bit slow but i felt this was necessary to build a relationship with the characters once things start moving along it almost never lets up until the credits roll thirst is predominantly a love story but not in the same sense that you would think the relationship between the lead characters is very intense but at the same time almost disturbing chanwook park is no stranger to controversy as we know and this film touches on taboo almost as much as oldboy the end scene is by far the most powerful in the movie and perhaps one of the best conclusions to a film i have seenbr br overall this is an exceptional film that i feel all movie buffs should see it is an excitingand admittedly different take on the world of vampires and the romance is far from sappy or boring this movie is gritty selfless and beautiful in all the wrong ways obviously it is not for everyone but chances are if you are reading this review you are already interested see it do not hesitate,1
at first glance a film like northfork a town set to be flooded in 1955 and a group of 6 characters who are sent out to evacuate the remaining townspeople could be just an ordinary film as we soon meet a remaining priest taking care of a sick child a greedy land owner we could be set up for a simple story we could all easily digest however when one is first introduced to this film you notice the amazing wide open cinematography and a scene involving a church hall missing a wall that opens up to the pastures and scenic view of the mountains with cattle grazing it soon becomes clear that after this scene and a few of the towns peoples introduction that this is no ordinary film and no ordinary story it is something very special and uniquebr br at first glance things are not as clear but the cinematography and landscape that the viewer is witness to is stunning and the characters that inhabit this small soon to be extinct area are just in word amazing its what can either draw you in closer to this qwerky film or either have you bored sitting there waiting for something to happenbr br the films deep spiritual and dream like qualities give it a slow and methodical approach which i am sure will bore some viewers but if you are patient with it and see the bigger picture the film is great to witnessbr br rating 8 out of 10,1
why is it that such romantic movies that never actually go anywhere always start and probably end with crappy jazz its not clever and it makes it look like a bloody tvmovie this film was sappy slow paced boring unoriginal wooden and did i say boringbr br harrison ford was probably trying to be mysterious and crude but he was just a crawling mumbling cop that seemed to walk into the congresswomans home like everything was fine when he behaved like a pervert staring at thomas with a pervy glare hardly ever bothering to speakbr br and why the hell do they always get british actors to put on crappy accents theyre casted because theyre famous and everybody knows theyre british precisely because theyre famous,0
i got the dvd very cheap and im a total drewbie and thats probably the only constellation where this movie could ever interest anyonebr br an early drew movie shes looking great and she gets a quite lot of really cute scenes of her like a shower scene a sexy dance scene quite a number of sexy outfits etc she does never show the friendly charm we know from her more recent moviesbr br the movie itself is pretty average or subaverage and much more looking like being made for the tv than one for the cinema there is no real horror or tension built up and the dialogs are often cheesybr br the most interesting part is probably the end because i honestly dont understand it but maybe there is nothing to understand about it anyway but at least you dont get the end you would be expecting and it also comes much sooner than one would have expectedbr br overall i think this movie is exclusively for drewbies,0
i appreciate the need to hire unknowns for these kind of horror movies but they should at least hire some proper actors the sergeant especially is guilty of using his monotone to bulldozer every single line he has but lets face it the lines arent really important there isnt really a recognisable plot so most of the writing involves the words fk st mfr and other assorted bad language in place of proper dialoguebr br the story as it is is mostly made up of seemingly random gore and death with a couple of cringeworthy surprises which happen around 10 minutes after you see exactly whats going to happen not only this but there are several glaring plot holes and continuity errors why are they going in there didnt he have a weapon wasnt he dead so it makes the whole film seem as if it has been cut down by the several hours it would take to fix thembr br another film which simply relies on blood and gore instead of any real cinematic experience,0
hugh ed harris is a hotshot bachelor senator determined to run for president one day however he happens upon an old high school classmate named aggie aggie diane keaton is an accomplished and awardwinning author with a lovely face and an independent spirit hugh is smitten he convinces aggie to become his fiancé but will aggie have to sacrifice her principles of honesty in the world of politics where things are not always what they seem to be and will she be able to withstand the rigors of a harsh media blitz this is mostly a nice romance for those who adore tales of affection hugh and aggie are absolutely in love and their banter and conversation are a good view however although the movie tries to show the political life in its reality it doesnt completely succeed nevermind the production values are high and the script is very elegantly written with these advantages and the handsome personages of keaton and harris those who sit down to the film will find it to be good entertainment,1

this movie has more goofs than any other movie i have seen in my life the special effects are damned terrible for instance near the end when the concorde is falling after the cargo door tears off the thing spins like a toy the special effects of airport 1970 are way better than this crap also the force of a concorde opening up at altitude and speed would essentially turn the thing insideout that is if it would even open at all but the movie has its good points mostly when it ends thats also cheesy eg the thing lands on a bank of looselypacked snow if it did that it would splinter into a million pieces overall 2 out of 10 instant flop great laugh flick,0
for me the tempest and its characters by which i mean the admirable ones are like old friends ever since i first began to experience the play through acting classes i played ferdinand i found myself immediately caught up in the fantastic world that shakespeare created i can distinctly remember one student deciding not to play ferdinand after all and so i took the stage and had the honor of playing opposite an excellent mirandabr br one of the virtues that a great friend has is that you can never fully know them there is always something you can discover about their character a film production of the tempest of quality is thus like a visit to an old friend dear to ones heart each visit presents one with new perspective on the memory we had of the work with prosperos books the ritual and the elegance of the play was emphasized the exuberant celebration of art within the art here we see a vision as esoteric mysticism with lovingly crafted interiors full of candles and chalk diagrams on floors more aleister crowley than naples nobleman it also made me reconsider why was it that prospero was cast out of naples his magical power is so palpable in this production that it makes one wonder whether it was just politics that doomed prospero to exile but rather the fact of his difference from his peers so in the real world he suffered was cast out powerless to change the wrong to the right all of the villains in this play whether they realize it or not act in accordance to creating a more painfilled hell of a world it is always in the interest of the oppressor to make life on earth closer to hell but prospero manages to bring these terrestrial villains into his island the realm where he has absolute dominionbr br shakespeare brings his audience to the theater the realm where shakespeare dictates the events the words the outcomes shakespeare is of course prospero but what this film adaptation does that really honors the text is to make prospero so sympathetic such a figure of reason despite the fact that he is surrounded by what society calls irrational astrological texts alchemical symbols magical diagrams etc is it more rational to be a man of the cloth and murder or to be a heretic and work towards the righting of wrongs prospero is a heretic for the reason he abandons his magic is not because the books will lose their value in naples but because they are not necessary anymore the world itself has become the magic of the booksbr br in hamlet hamlet presents a play to his peers the play accuses his fellows of conspiring against others for their own advancement the reaction of the audience varies while ophelia is puzzled claudius reacts with stunned shock this happens within the play and then shakespeare has this play performed for the men of his time did shakespeare watch for their reactions in the tempest prospero lives the play he,1
this must be one of the worse movies that i have ever seen on a par with blair witch and just as annoying the flashing helmet lights made things difficult to see and i think that epileptics should take heed as there are moments with strobing that makes this movie even more annoying i think if they had been quieter they might have found a way out then when you think the geek might come up trumps even he resorts to a nervous breakdown oh and when is the guy who is having sex realise that when the girl says she can hear something she can really hear something one of these guys must have at least seen scream where they draw your attention to such things it is also a big letdown when a premise offers so much promise and then someone writes the script so sorry folks i got this on weekly at the video shop and i would still like my money back,0

i am being in no way facetious when i say that this movie was worse than any other movie ever made worse than batman robin worse than manos hands of fate seriously its that bad when people tell me that a movie is terrible i use the two girls scale to figure it out if the movie is comparable to two girls then i wont watch it if its twice as good maybe ill watch it but only to laugh at the retards who paid somebody to make it because a movie twice as good as this one would still be a piece of garbage,0
as is often the case films about selfloathing characters do not usually make for good drama downloading nancy is no exception its supposedly based on a true story about a woman whos murdered at her own request by someone she meets over the internetbr br the protagonist is nancy maria bello who is married to albert rufus sewell albert is a successful software developer who has developed a golf game which his company has successfully marketed to various bars and barrestaurants unlike most human beings albert has virtually no positive attributes except for his ability to be successful in the business world throughout the film albert has a grim and dour expression on his face he has no sympathy for his wife with all her emotional problems and resorts to patronizing prostitutes when his wife asks for sex he punishes her by masturbating in her presence insteadbr br nancy is equally onenote as a character not only has she had a loveless 15 year marriage but was sexually abused by her uncle when she was growing up thankfully there are no flashbacks of that back story in the film her selfloathing takes the form of selfmutilation and a result shes forced into therapy however she has such contempt for her therapist that no progress can be madebr br finally nancy is so depressed that she contacts louis over the internet hes sort of a sadomasochistic gigolo who has sex with women for money while inflicting massive amounts of pain to boot its revealed that louis has two children but no longer sees them the childrens mother no longer wants anything to do with himbr br nancys plan is to first have painful sex with louis and then have him kill her theres a particularly unpleasant scene where louis has sex with nancy while slashing her vaginal area with a broken piece of glass these scenes are shown as flashbacks after louis pays a visit to albert who ties him up and strikes him with a golf club it seems that louis has a twofold plan in going to see albert 1 berate him for his treatment of nancy and 2 enjoy the beating he receives it takes awhile before louis will reveal nancys fatefirst he forces albert to do him the favor of taking his dog to a relative so someone will care for it in the future nancys fate of course is that louis finally ended up choking her to death but showed some hesitation first as he made it clear that he had some feelings for her we soon learn that louis is imprisoned for life for nancys murderbr br what exactly are we to take away from a film such as downloading nancy are we supposed to feel sorry for victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence is that the main point of the film is sympathy for nancy actually warranted i dont think so the films writers create a straw man in the character of albertsomeone who is so cut off from his emotions that he is the,0
here it is the first ever episode of friends where we get introduced to control freak monica gellar courtney cox newly divorced ross gellar david schimmer hippy pheobe buffay lisa kudrow unknown actor and ladies man matt le blanc and very sarcastic chandler bing matthew perry this is how the scene starts off until we introduced to the 6th and final friend spoilt kid rachel green jennifer anistonbr br the episode is better than most people give credit for like any new sitcom the first episode isnt always fantastic the acting in this episode isnt great because the cast cannot identify and arnt really believable in their new characters apart from kudrow and perry who shinebr br matt le blanc man his acting was down right dreadful because until later he gets more confident but i think he tries to be funny but at most failsbr br david schimmer why does he over pronounce every word he cannot speak normally but he became one of the funniest characters in later seasons but he isnt confident and i cannot sympathise with him jennifer aniston looks hot and does a good job as rachel green but we only see the real rachel later in the 1st season courtney cox looks quite anorexic in this episode its worrying she looks totally different now more healthily she acting is a little sketchy but everyones is in this 20 minute pilot lisa kudrow and matthew perry im doing these two together because their comic timing and acting quality was superb and for lisa this was one of her first roles and she is so natural as pheobe pheebs and matthew perry is just matthew perry playing himself basically the episode quality does improve later such as the sets they looks dark and creepy in this episode and makes them seem unfriendly the acting is ok the characters gain confidence with each new scene and i am proud this is the pilot i hope we see the friends reunite cause they will always be there for us,1
a sophisticated contemporary fable about the stresses that work to loosen and ultimately unbind the vows of marriage the main thrust of the narrative arises from a homily spoken by a country priest following the wedding vows of a young cosmopolitan couple from milan in it the future course of the marriage is spelled out which bit by bit frays from the stresses of modern life the moral of this story within a story is that in order for a marriage to work out both now and in the past it has been necessary for that relationship to be abutted by family and friends this film was a relative blockbuster by domestic italian standards its a terrible shame that this film is not available in either dvd or vhs,1

i am a huge adam sandler fan and one day i was looking at the castcrew selection on one of his dvds and saw going overboard and decided to go out and rent it so i went out with a few buddies of mine and rented it we put it on and we were shocked to see an adam sandler that didnt hit puberty yet he looks as if he was 12 when this movie came out i couldnt even watch 30 minutes of this crap i didnt laugh chuckle or even smirk at this movie actually the only time i smirked was when i saw how horrid this movie was i could not believe how hard he tried to make the viewers laugh in this movieand it didnt work once although from seeing the horribly awful camera angles and hearing the disgusting script i realized why i had never heard of this moviebecause it sucks more than anything has ever sucked before this movie in my opinion was the worst movie ever madeever,0

cétait complètement minable à fuir absolument br br this was an idiotic attempt to destroy classic source material and thoroughly succeededbr br do not see this film under any circumstances unless you wish to have your ten euros torn up and shoved up your nostrils by a bunch of vapid atrociously unamusing charactersbr br this type of film clearly illustrates the gulf that still unfortunately divides directors and audiences if the individual heaven forbid a collective could have conceived this dross behind this had been considerate enough to watch the version currently playing in french cinemas he or she would have endured what i was forced to endure and mercifully rewritten it or just scrapped it altogether the vein of adult humour being mined here dates to my mind back to fritz the cat but lacks that films avantgarde status or even its base attempt at social commentarybr br with the proliferation of remakes and increasing reliance on preexisting source material to fund storytelling these days one would hope that choosing snow white and thus not having to worry about conceiving characters or a radically new story would have allowed more time for oh i dont know interesting animation smarter jokes perhaps a coherent film that has something to say and doesnt telegraph its vacuity from the opening frame br br a manifestly appalling production,0

1956s the man who knew too much is exceptional entertainment to those who prefer the 1934 original i will say that that one is faster paced and wittier however even though the american version was heaven forbid a big budget blockbuster i believe it blows the british version out of the water i think this is one of hitchcocks 10 bestno small feat considering he made over 50 films and many of them were among the greatest of all time i find so many things to lovebr br 1james stewart americas favorite everyman for so many years does an excellent job playing the distressed father here he can make any film enjoyable and working with such a likeable character in such a gripping story he had me rooting for him very intensely leslie banks in the original is nothing in comparisonbr br 2doris day yes doris day despite all the criticisms directed toward her i think she makes the loving wifemother an extremely sympathetic person i disagree with the negative remarks towards her character just because she is softspoken and gentle it doesnt mean she is docile and helpless i dont want to spoil anything but she does make a crucial discovery by herself after her husband has failed she gives the story a level of warmth that just wasnt there in the first one and for those who care about that this version is the way to go and i loved que sera sera i think it is one of the most beautiful songs ive ever heard and deservedly won its oscar it elevated the film to another levelbr br 3the albert hall sequence i dont think it was too long at all i think the suspense built the whole time to that terrific crescendo and hitchcocks direction in this scene was absolutely brilliant and the assassin was truly frightening br br 4the ending really put a smile on my face even after the aforementioned scene was over i found the rescue scene to be exciting and it was great to see the charming family together again the last line in the film is highly amusing i dont think the film started out slowly hithcock was trying to get us to know and like the mckennas and he did a great job i wasnt a huge fan of the kid playing hank but i didnt have a problem with him since hank was ben and jos kid i cared about him too its not like he was a brat or anything br br i found no major flaws in this movie and so many major and minor virtues way to go hitch,1
there are no spoilers in this review theres nothing to spoilbr br no plot nothing most clip shows at least try to tie the clips into the plot by some tenuous stretch but this didnt even do that clips three lines to lead into the next interminable sequence of dull clips ok so perhaps they were short on production time but theyd have been better off skipping this episode entirely what a waste of timebr br im not sure how this got made in fact scrubs is usually much better at subverting tropes but somehow this got throughbr br thank heavens they were back on form by the next episode,0
how many of us wish that we could throw away social and cultural obligations and be free most of us i suspect shall we dance is not a movie about dancing it is about learning about ourselves recognising what we are looking for in life and having the courage to go in search of it mr sugiyama is a middleaged member of a japanese society where ballroom dancing is viewed as unsuitable behaviour br br one day mr sugiyama sees a beautiful girl leaning out of the window of a dancing acadamy he is fascinated by her and eventually signs up for dancing lessons he is ashamed of his dancing and afraid of ridicule he hides the fact that he is attending dancing classes from his colleagues and familybr br there is a hilarious scene in the mensroom at the office when sugiyama and watanabe a workmate who also dances are interrupted practising some dance steps there are many other funny and warmhearted scenesbr br the ending is not a fairytale but it leaves the viewer feeling goodbr br this movie helped me to understand the japanese people a little better it is a warm and very worthwhile film to see,1
not that all disney films are garbagebr br anyway i saw legend of boggy creek first and absolutely loved the film when i heard it had 2 sequels i was ecstatic i finally found a copy of this and watched it one night i dont see how they can make a grated sequel to a horror film the original is a moviedocumentary about the fauke monster and can scare anyone return is for kids and should not be watched by anyone i dont remember the plot too well as its been quite some time since i watched it and i will not watch it again but its about these hunters coming to town and they go looking to kill bigfoot three little kids sneek out of the house to stop them a big monsoon comes through the hunters get hurt are saved by the kids then they all hide out in a boat with a big piece of tarp on top and try to wait out the storm then all of a sudden bigfoot comes and does something really sick i dont wanna ruin the ending for any of yas but its not scary well,0

this is my favorite game for the nintendo 64 platform ive played many different firstperson shooters and ive never really liked any of them much but this game has a certain something that i cant put my finger on that makes it an amazing amount of fun maybe its the extraordinary detail put into the game maybe its the fluid movement of the characters maybe its the gadgets and weapons maybe its the suave character of james bond whatever it is this game never seems to get old no matter how many times ive played it,1
this movie probably began with a good idea but thats as far as it went when i read the cover at blockbuster i thought it had promise but that was based on the overall idea for the movie the movie began with a professor talking about how in the future we will be able to see creatures from other dimensions there was no explanation of how that would happen but thats okay i thought it would be developed that in the movie it wasnt in the next scene we see two young men lying on tables with tubes taped to their heads beside each one are two attractive women the men begin asking do you hear that or do you see them we conclude they think they are seeing ghosts or some other creature that seem invisible or they are hallucinating the women do not see these creatures this was fine for the first five minutes but this scene goes on for a full hour it is briefly punctuated by flashbacks that have no correlation to the so called plot of the film we are also introduced to a man in a lab coat and what appear to be middle eastern terrorists what is this about we never find out the flash backs lead us to believe that the terrorists are forcing the man in the lab coat to perform diabolical experiments on these young people but we never understand why at the end of the movie the terrorists finally do what terrorists do they blow up the lab but why what is the point we have no idea this film contains so many disconnected thoughts and ideas that there are too many to enumerate but one more notable one is that fact that the man in the lab coats and the terrorist pop in and out of the room throughout the movie and not once do the young men attempt to escape or even leave the tables on which they are laying even though they are not strapped down the makers of the movie also bring in cameo appearances by cockroaches on several occasions but again we never learn what that has to do with the storyline sorry but this movie was a waste of 4 and the time i spent driving to the rental store and then watching it take my advice dont rent it,0
from what ive read a lot of people were disappointed by this film compared to part 1 initially i could understand this but after a bit of thought i think they are wrong to be soderbergh continues his fact based telling of ches life that he started in part 1 part 1 told a story of a revolution moving from unpromising beginnings to an ultimately successful conclusion part 2 tells a story of a revolution that moves from unpromising beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion it is not soderberghs fault that these 2 parts of ches life had completely different outcomes he bravely chooses to tell both in a fairly straightforward way the viewer may feel a lot better coming out of the cinema after part 1 than part 2 but that is the reality of ches life and not in my opinion any fault of the director the film is far from perfect it is probably too long at least in part 1 we saw different aspects of the war as the guerrillas had successes in part 2 they cant catch a break and we see their numbers constantly being reduced by death and capture ches capture and death are dealt with well the film is greatly enhanced by the dialogue being in spanish benicio del toro is again excellent as the charismatic argentinian so if youve seen part 1 you will see a very similar telling of a very different story in part 2,1
i dont know what neighborhoods the folks who wrote the rave reviews for this movie live in but im glad im not there if they dont comment on the cartoonishness of this thing okay we learn to suspend our disbelief in films like the die hard series but seeing little jodie knock off a whole street gang with a glock as a novice yetcmon all she needed was a bald head and a ripped tshirt and she would be bruce willis br br apparently jodie being the executive producer blinded her to what a joke and waste of her money this would be or she was living out some kind of fantasy where she is the only blonde and everyone else is a brunette black or hispanic even the dog is black little blondie is the only good one and except for a black police officer everyone else in town is some nasty minority out to get her has your fear of your acting talent declined so far that you think the only way you can get noticed is to be the only bright spot literally on camera in a dark morose and somber neighborhoodfilmcast apparently she thought she was in the wrong moviethe dark knightbr br ridiculous plot holes furniture chewing acting gratuitous violence look girls now you can do it toospend the time with your family instead of watching this drek,0
nine out of ten might seem like a high mark to give for a straight to video scifi movie thats been vilified at the us box office and roundly criticized as the poorest movie of kurt russells careerbr br i have my reasonsbr br firstly when you read negative reviews of this film they usually start with the wooden nature of russells interpretation of todd the eponymous soldier im going to start here too with my surprising statement that this is possibly the finest piece of acting ive seen russell pull off todd is an emotional cripple and suffering from intense ptsd this movie being written before the phenomenon was as widely recognized as it is nowbr br the portrayal is spot on todd is withdrawn uncommunicative and a loner he suffers from irrational anxiety keyed to a fever pitch by training that teaches him to analyze every movement and interaction with another human being for signs of betrayal and danger his hyperfocus brings with it an inability to comprehend the bigger continuum that the tasks he is given to do sit within there is a scene where he cuts himself slicing carrots and continues to work unfazed not cleaning up the cut or the blood many interpret this as a sign of his physical toughness and focus on the job at hand but it is also a sign that he is simply performing the requested task by rote not comprehending the relationship between the vegetables hes preparing and the food that will be eaten laterbr br todds dialog is spartan to say the least the two big talking scenes he gets are central to the plot of the movie and both underline the bleak nature of his existence fear and discipline we are told always fear to keep him pumped up to a hyper alert state where the smallest detail will not pass him by keeping him ready to react on a knife edge discipline to hold him in check through his fear to overcome it and perform tactically the inference is that he has no time to think and cannot afford feelings many viewers have different interpretations of his reaction to the hug from nielsens sandra but i believe you have to interpret it from the perspective of a human whos only experience of an embrace is in combat the trembling represents him suppressing his fight flight instincts reacting to the fear of being grappled his movement and vision restricted fear and discipline indeedbr br then there is the subtext of his abandonment twice in fact so representative of the way our society tends to toss infantrymen onto the rubbish heap of society when theyve served their terms 40 of the unemployed are exmilitary in our world in his it can only be worse russell quickly picks up the mantle of maces responsibility to his wife and child desperately in need of a mission even one with such a high likelihood of his deathbr br then there is the military subtext too the conflict between buseys church and the hotshot,1
how i got into it when i started watching this series on cartoon networki have to say that ive never seen anything like thisand it was the best but when i started collecting the series on vhsand years later on dvd part of bandais anime legends collections it was amazingand truly worth watching it had a lot of exploding action that will blow you out of your seat and of coursethe theme songs just communicationand rhythm emotions were the bestbr br charactersand gundams my favorite characters in the show wereheeroduorelenatreizelady undnoinand zechs my favorite gundams in the show that i liked the most are the wing zeroand epyonand of course the altronand deathscythe iand iibr br meaning of the show what this series also tells us that in real lifewars are very hard and we can sometimes winor lose but peace can also be hard to obtainand i do believe the gundam pilots are doing the right thingand are trying to obtain world peacebr br but howeverthis show is truly the best of the best so in closing to this reviewafter you watch this showsee the movie endless waltz,1
if jean renoirs first film whirlpool of fate first takes us into the world of the countryside the rivers the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards put the characters from the first two films together and you have the seeds of his great grand illusion and rules of the game this is beautifully filmed with the restless camera making full use of the amazingly huge apartments and backstage areas that dominate the films interiors and the acting though frequently overwrought offers some great moments as well particularly from werner krauss muffat but the glamorous and sultry ms hessling who at first appears as if she might give louise brooks a run for her money in vampishness never goes beyond a one note selfish harlot portrayal perhaps this is in part a problem with the script which does seem to mostly go for high points and outraged emotions not having read the novel im not really clear on whether the choices were wellmade or notbr br still the differences between nanas suitors are welldrawn and i particularly liked the relationship between muffat and jean angelos vandeuvres the tragic understandings that each seems to have of his ultimate fate and their sympathy with each other particularly in the scene at the bottom of the enormous staircase where vandeuvres warns muffat and we wonder if violence will erupt this and other gleanings of the ridiculousness of the idle rich help give the film the depth it hasbr br far from his greatest achievement and for me probably just shy overall of whirlpool of fate this is still well worth seeing for renoir fans or those interested in silent cinema generally,1

sadly every single person i ask about this series says theyve never heard of it i remember it fondly from my early childhood i wasnt quite 10 when it came outbr br my favorite story was a story short something about the way the stone soup story was woven into a greater story gets me every time and then the storyteller explains why he has no story to tell and it becomes a story itself ive always been a fan of jim henson and this is just one reason whybr br im adding this dvd on the self with labrynth the dark crystal the neverending story the princess bride the last unicorn willow and mirrormask these are all dvds i share with my siblings who are 6 5 and 4 yrs old,1
there are some excellent comments and observations on this film i was pleased to note the comparisons to fritz langs m forget the 50s abortive remake with lightweight david wayne the real villain is not the tortured murderer extraordinarily fine performance by jeffery demunn taking out his sexually frustrated anger on his victims mostly children he is the objective the real villain is the stifling bureaucratic soviet system drowning in its own corrupted incompetence the frustration of an uncompromisingly dedicated man rea in his best role since the crying game a facile pragmatist whos willing to use the system to his advantage sutherland always successful in this kind of role a hesitant frightened but determined psychiatrist the incomparable max sydow the bumbling boopous bureaucrat of a prosecutor brilliant brit actor john wood and the quiet supporting wife of the driven investigator delightful supporter imelda staunton this is one damn fine film its darkness and bleakness are supported by the portrayal of a corrupt incompetent system which works against success the is no need to dip into goreladen slice n dice sensationalism that has characterized so many recent films gore is present its a ghastly story but it adds to the depicting of a pathologically twisted human being the success of the story is precisely that these were acts perpetrated by a person a human like you or i where you and i choose to vent our frustration by reasonable means chikatilo took his anger out on the most innocent and vulnerable of us our children the superb premise of this story is made manifest by an equally superb cast of excellent actors sadly i note that our australian friend didnt like the speech and no doubt would have preferred to hear them speaking in aussie dialect well too bad this fine film sure worked for me and everyone else ive talked with who has seen it,1
i saw this dvd in my friends house and thought that this was a turkish action movie with some hollywoodnot very bignames in it interested enough i decide to give it a shot later it was a tough to bear experience believe me then after finally seeing the credits roll i tought we turks really suck at hollywood style film making this is an insult to the heisthostage movie genre but then wait i checked some names and no they were not turkish names and no this was not a turkish movie on the contrary it was literally shot in america with an american director crew that made me thinkingagain how on earth can you persuade names like micheal madsen edward furlong or even arnold vosloo to take part in such a project with money probably that kept me thinking further how can you raise such amount of money to offer them and a supposedly international cast then all my meditation paid off and i came to find the answerby hiring the cheapest equipment and crew that you can find and if you still have to difficulty in adjustin your budget then by writing and directing the movie you are trying to produceor vice versa i dont have any information on that so bottom line this is not a bad movie as everybody are so anxious to present as it makes you think in my case even meditate and there are a lot of movies outthere that doesnt give even that affect this one at least makes you think it makes you wonder it leaves you with disbelief and then it makes you wonder again,0

this movie has no plot no character development and no budget it really sucks to put it in short terms since there is no development for the movie it really cant even be looked as trying to be artistic or trying to make a statement against torture which leaves two other reasons to possibly watch it to be shocked or to get off on it like a sick little freak well it falls short here too the girls reactions just seem dumb its extremely easy to tell that its fake honestly professional wrestling looks more realistic than the crap they try to get by with in this movie they throw innards on her but shes asleep for most of it so its just kinda dumb the only really kind of worthwhile part is the end when they quickly cut from scene to scene just before the needle goes into her eye but honestly the girl is extremely ugly and everything is incredibly fake with the exception of the eye if you want a good movie about torture go watch hostel and hostel 2 not only do they both contain realistic violence but there is also an actual storyline that draws you in and makes you care about the people plus the tow movies really work on a deeper level considering themes like american fears of foreigners issues of morality testing how far a person can go human instincts vs civilization and many other things plus they are carefully written and contain some good humor when the story isnt focused on the violence these are much better choices over this piece of crap,0
im really amazed that this got an 88 on rotten tomatoes and a nomination for best foreign film at the oscars the 73 rating on imdb thats not so much of a surprise seeing the way imdb users have been voting recently i just cant get into a film in which the actual facts about its main character have clearly been distorted and not at all in a way to make the movie artistic but rather to make it melodramatic and less boring which it turns out actually makes it very boring for anyone who was expecting to see a serious and credible interpretation of the life of genghis khan the farfetched and overdramatized mongol often echoes the likes of 300 a film that couldnt be happier to be ridiculously inaccurate but unlike 300 mongol takes itself seriously its stoic seriousness mixed with the obvious inaccuracies is what makes it truly the most boring film ive seen this year possibly the most action or biopic movie ive ever seen the characters were pathetically written honestly i doubt genghis khan was as boring and passive as shown in this film which is funny to me because if theres anything that id think should be changed for the sake of theatricality its making a boring person into an interesting person the romance between khan and borte is similarly boring simple and stupid also without giving anything away mongol contains the single stupidest scene i have seen in a long time where there should be a good 20 minutes of plot development the film just skips forward without any explanation it looked like something out of a saturday night live skit that parodies epic action movies with horrible pacing did i mention how seriously mongol takes itself meanwhile it drags like no film ive ever seen before even now i could swear it was three hours long about 45 minutes into it i checked the time being pretty certain that it was almost finished besides some pretty scenery and quality acting from asano naturally mongol is honestly just a disaster it completely failed to entertain me or enlighten me in anyway i would never give this film a second chance and not to sound racist or patriotic or whatever but give me a trashy and mindless american epic over mongol any day at least then i know what im getting unlike with mongol where the reviews and ratings led me to believe it was actually something worth seeingbr br the saddest thing about how much i hated mongol is that i have friends who i know without a doubt would simply love it,0
i really liked this movie kurt manages to act without speaking letting moments speak for themselves he doesnt have to verbalize or rationalize his actions he simply decides and takes action he is supported by a good cast of actors and settings and is able to show us a more humane side of soldiers without getting to corny,1
this film is the one which you fall in love with alfred hitchcock shall always remain over the top of any directors of his time the most influential aspects about his films are sheer simplicity gripping drama the another best thing about hitchcocks films is a definite gripping endbr br any thing said about the man who knew too much is less the cinematography acting dialogs camera works are magnificent in this movie the song que sera sera at the end shall remain in our memories for life time the film is so enjoyable from start to end that we never know when it ends rarely would hitchcock include humor in his films this film has comic scenes which fits in to the movie br br this film is absolutely brilliant as good as vertigo,1
it may be hard to explain how but this film is a masterpiece perhaps because i never imagined that a plot like this or a film with so few words would convey all this poetry the true poetry and aristocracy of human passions and obsession bogard is amazing and needless to say that venice is utilised as a perfect scenery dark sinking and dreary just like bogards soul and classical music is more that a simple background escort to human feelings in my opinion a classic masterpiece of european filmmaking,1
countenance antoine monot in a copycat impersonation of kevin smiths silent bob keeps asking for it but writerdirector christian zübert never listens zübert just cant say no to a joke no matter how cheap the best thing about this movie is its soundtrack of course joey burns of calexico and the divine jonathan richman understated oldschool bard of theres something about mary fame would grace any smalltown dropout story in visual allure stefan lukas gregorowicz looks cool enough riding his tan sixseries bmw twodoor wearing aviator shades going nowhere true he accidentally sleeps with his wildeyed bohemian kid sister marie zielcke but then who wouldnt thumbs up also to how he goes blackandwhite on a liberal dose of that mysterious substance they call zerozero but if youre looking for a slightly more serious rendering of what intoxication can do to you i suggest you check out fear and loathing in las vegas,0

i am in awe of the number of people who consider this film to be decentmuch less great do the majority of people even have basic standards for a film they watch i just dont know anymorebr br this commercial cinematic product doesnt really deserve the respect of being called a film to call dean cain talented is a gross injustice to anyone who actually has talent i have had a lot of respect for lori petty but most of that has gone right down the tubes at least her role was extremely small maybe she had a bill that desperately needed to get paidbr br the ignorance i saw while viewing firetrap was amazing let me start out by getting this off my chest if you cant show fire realistically then dont show it at all okay its an embarrassment to all involved when you show lame effects that dont even come close to simulating an actual burning buildingbr br some interesting tidbits 1 a janitor opens the door to a large storage closet and finds the entire room engulfed in flames what does he do he tries to put out the fire with his broom 2 the same janitor who knows the building is on fire later comes across a door marked hazardous materials his brilliant mind tells him that it would be a great idea to open said door big mistake 3 a woman is giving a fantastically generous donation of 100000 to a greyhound rescue fund butshes wearing a fur coat to the charity event theyre holding wouldnt people who care about animals kinda frown on that sort of thing 4 several of the people in the movie are forced into a vault of some sort with massive steel walls that even an electromagnetic pulse couldnt penetrate yet they have a spacious air vent leading right into the back of the thing that anyone could crawl through that sure seems like a lapse in securitybr br i could go on and on but i have grown tiresome thinking about this lame movie our hero whom we are supposed to be cheering for is a career criminal who early on tries to kill some police officers what a swell guy if the general public wants to waste their minds away on this drivel then more power to them i just wish i could have it erased from my memory 110,0
spoiler this film gives away plot points and discusses the ending i hated this film mostly for political reasons but also for moral and aesthetic reasons politically this film glorified war and military technology blowing things up real good we are led to cheer as the music swells and the afghans use our weapons to blow the ruskies to bits and no us soldiers put their lives on the line so its a fun war aesthetically there isnt a touch of real human emotion in the film just smug privileged people being sarcastic feeling superior and doing whatever they want regardless of the consequences and speaking of consequences the film only makes a few small hits at what the arming of the afghans actually led to i had read an earlier draft of this script and it ended on 911 with charlie wilson realizing that things had gone horribly wrong but that wouldnt leave the audience feeling good this is a feel good movie about killing ruskies and it made me sick,0
i recently was in a stage version of this play and on the last day of the run i was excited to see that it was going to be playing on tv i stuck a tape in as it was on late at night and i watched it the next day i have to say i was very disappointed the actors in the film made few of the discovers that are in the script that is understandable as the resersal process is probably different but it was upsetting to see a lot of the original script was changed for the movie as well to make it better for the screen but i am not sure if it helped the movie out at all i gave this 4 stars only because i know the script and the writing is a lot better than what this movie portrays,0
first what is really great about this movie br br ryan reynolds great acting there are very few actors i really like and for now he is one of them he has an amazing skill to impersonate characters br br the soundtrack very good music played at the right time br br the idea of a nine lost in his own world incapable of leaving br br still i give it only a 3 out of 10 for certain flaws br br horrible second part it seems that the director was very eager to make something new but despite of the efforts it was really boring br br very annoying character melissa i couldnt stand the scenes with her ie it was constantly annoying she represents everything that is wrong with american woman br br terrible explanation of the numbers the director was so busy with character development that he completely missed the point of a good story excuse me koalas brr terriblebr br this movie had great potential the filming is nicely done the music is really good but nothing morebr br see it only if you are a fan of ryan reynolds or have a lot of time to spare,0
this is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their erasmus year in barcelona which by the way is one of the most beautiful towns in europe and is an ideal location br br the idea itself with all the different languages is great and gives the film an original atmosphere there are some clichés about the countries but most of them are true the characters could not better represent their different countriesbr br having experienced erasmus on myself during my exchang semester in italy i can say that is movie is incredibly authentic i had many experiences which were similar to the characters except i didnt get laid as often the movie is also quite funny yet not like all those stupid american college moviesbr br finally the movie touches also some important issues like the change from student to work lifebr br 910 i may not be very objective though,1
if you just watched all dogs go to heaven and learn that theres a sequel dont watch it its horrible its absolutely awful they rush the characters to develop sasha for example begins singing about how you can count her out for love and at the end this seems more like a dramatic romance flick than a comedyadventure film they rip charlie out of his character and replace him with a gushy soft but still rebellious version of himselfbr br the humor behind carfaces character is just completely lost hes a totally different dog he doesnt have a cool voice anymore he isnt that villain you love to hate anymore hes just a wimp voiced by none other than mermaid man from spongebob speaking of voice actorsbr br charlie has a completely different voice and while it isnt horrible i dont like it its terrible in comparison to the excellent job that burt reynolds did for the character in the first film dom deluise is wonderful as always as itchy that character stays true and thats why this film gets a 310 purely because dom deluise was still voicing itchybr br oh and my last complaint i know annmaries movie was done and gone she has parents now etc but did charlie completely forget about her or what no mention at all of her in the second film i mean even a small mention from itchy would have been acceptable ex charlie we have to get back you cant take care of every kid that needs rescuing or something of the sort i mean he died living with her she deserves some kind of mentionbr br dont watch this if youre looking for a wonderful sequel,0
i was disappointed with the sequel to the swan princess i can see what they were trying to do with the story show how married life was going for odette and derek but the story wasnt interesting enough to hold my attention and it seemed to cover the same bases as the originalbr br it isnt funny the only bit i found humorous was when jeanbob was turned into a prince and then back into a frog and noone saw it happen and he was trying to convince them that it really didbr br the villain is rubbish and the animation isnt as impressive as the first filmbr br the queen is a very irritating character and instead of cheering with derek to rescue his mother youre hoping that the villain puts a spell on her voice box to stop her talkingbr br it is a shame because i really liked the first movie but it didnt live up to my expectations,0
i remember thinking that due to the cast the subject matter and the director i was going to love this moviebr br stepping into the theatre and taking my seat i was like a giddy schoolgirl as my anticipation for the opening scene builtbr br i was not disappointed with the opening and felt that i was truly going to love this moviebr br if you havent seen the movie and feel that anything that gives away scenes might be seen as a spoiler please stop reading im not going to give away anything really important but it might be seen as such so that is the warningbr br spoiler may be included below bewarebr br i think that the first scene that really hit me as just utterly ridiculous was the russian space station scene i mean honestly refueling a shuttle with no real prior warning and then to simply show the station as being so fragile that a simple little mistake can cause the entire thing to just explodebr br while all of this is possible it seemed to me to be way over the top im not sure if it was just the situation or if it was the cheesy acting the silly view of the russian technology or just the campy attitude of the scene itselfbr br it only got worse for me after that because then we endure what seemed like 2 hours of constant super loud explosions in spaceyou know that place where there is no sound because its a vacuumbr br but the coup de grace for me honestly was the gun scene spoiler possibility earlier in the movie we see bruce willis tearing apart their land vehicle the vehicle that they will use to drive around in when they get there and to help them drill when he is told that this is what they will be using he is taking pieces off and complaining about it because much of whats on it is heavy and not required for what they are doingbr br so then as we are wandering onto the asteroids we see that they have opted to add a massive gatling like gun to the vehiclesyou know standard nasa fare is to have heavy weaponry on all space missions in case you know aliens or somethingbr br i could have taken the explosive 2 hours the silly russian space station refueling scene the cheesy love scene near the end the bruce willis character being nothing more than most of his other past characters but the steve buscemi going mad and shooting the space vehicles gun all over the place and causing havocdamage well that threw the entire thing over the top for mebr br save your money and time and avoid this movie if you want a good meteor movie see deep impact if you want a fun space movie with awesome special effects see space cowboys but no matter what avoid this flick,0
this movie is truly unbelievable in every sense of the word i couldnt believe what i was seeing and hearing and i didnt believe it anyhow hepburn is probably my favorite actress but this was ridiculous being a hillbilly myself i know what it should sound like and its not kates back bay accent the only thing i found funnier was the fact that the guy who played charlie chan so many times sydney toler was cast as another one of the hillbillies with accent to match maybe this was a practical joke come to think of it i can think of no other reason for such peculiar casting well maybe this i noticed that natalie schaefer lovey howell on gilligans island appeared in this play on broadway can you imagine what part she might have played,0
let me say at the outset that im not a very artistic person and that i dont get new art that being said this film is absolutely crazy and in my opinion not crazy in a good way filmed entirely in black and white with a series of very loosely connected stories avida is a film for those who can look at modern art and say wow i feel the energy and passion of this painting the only reason i give this film a 3 out of 10 is because i actually did manage to laugh at some parts though mainly laughing at the sheer insanity of the film two of the characters throwing chairs on a lawn as to do what these characters were doing i have no idea i wouldnt recommend this film to anybody,0
i saw this in a preview screening and have to say that this documentary style movie is the biggest load of tripe i have ever seenbr br completely unfunny low budget boring rubbish script terrible acting the entire audience young and old sat through the film comatose without laughing for most of it there were literally only about 2 places you will laugh in the entire moviebr br many people left halfway cant blame them i stayed thinking that the film would pick up however it never did and i wish id left br br the humour was really lame and i am surprised that this ever made it on to the big screen i am not someone who is offended by the adult content of this movie at all it just wasnt funny the people who made this movie really dont deserve your money so please dont pay to see this filmbr br this isnt even funny enough to be shown on tv let alone cinemabr br i wanted to give it 0 out of 10 but the system wont allow it,0

the movie looked like a walkthrough for immoral study most likely i never got much involved with the burning need of the female artist to immortalize male nudes and thus all that fuss about now who drew this penis sounded a bit gratuitous dialogues in this movie are rather dreadful albeit visually this movie got its moments i almost dig it when tassi got into painting a mental picture but then movie weered back onto penises highly recommended to those who has not seen one in a while,1
the script seems to have been wholesale ahem ahem cough cough borrowed from a certain other movie involving using a selfpropelled manned drilling machine scene by scene the two movies were almost identical just enough of the serial numbers filed off in this one to prevent a copyright infringement lawsuitbr br but other than that i have to say i found this somewhat entertaining as i enjoy deepundergroundintheearth genre of movies its a little bit on the stupid side as far as the science goes but if one is willing to squint ones eyes real hard and pretend one didnt notice that scientific gaffe here and there and all over this movie is almost bearable far better than supernova which was another flick that luke perry had a leading role in that was so dumb dumb dumb that nothing could save it a note to movie makers employ someone who knows something about the subject the movie deals with it would be a very small part of the movie budget but it would have a big effect overall in helping prevent your audience from guffawing at you for doing dumb sciencebr br production values almost passable ive seen far worse in my timebr br a new thought for disaster movies instead of them always having a happy ending where the world gets saved yet once again how about some where things are a tad bit more realistic where sometimes even the very best efforts still end up in failure particularly when the problem that needs to be resolved was caused in the first place by sheer stupidity stupiditycaused disaster movies with glowing heartwarming endings sort of backhandedly justify stupidity by stating no matter how awful a problem is caused by braindead stupidity it can be fixed which is definitely not the case a selfcaused disaster movie with an unhappy ending would serve better as cautionary tale of dont be so damn stupid in the first place should you watch this movie if youre bored and youve seen everything else in the scifi section at your local video rental store sure why not but do avoid supernova as i can assure you that youre not that bored that definitely was not one of luke perrys better movies this one is better thats not saying much but it is betterbr br one dead hoof up for being a deepunderground genre movie one dead hoof down for naughtily ripping off from the screenplay of another certain movie of the same genre,0
the movie itself is not too bad many comments have pointed out the obvious flaws of the script but it is watchable what really gives me the creeps though is that people like justin timberlake even get cast for movies and on top of that for movies like this one i have to admit i had never heard the mans name before watching this but the very instant he appeared i was just plain annoyed the voice is crap the face is a bad ripoff of legolas the posture is horrible and he cannot even properly coordinate all three of them said to say i was delighted when he got jumped after leaving the disco because i was hoping from then on it would be morgan freeman and kevin spacey only too bad i was wrong these two and also ll cool j give a very decent performance and they are the main reason i give this a 4 br br i see many upcoming movies with the little timberlake cast and cannot believe it,0
this tv movie goes to show that bad films do exist the only reason i saw this was it was covered on a ktma mst3k its super bowl at the superdome in new orleans however no football is played whatsoever and we see the behind the scenes look at basically nothing with the many stars in this film it made no difference i really dont know why i watched this,0
this movie was well acted and kept my interest in the main character for the entire movie stu unger lived an extraordinary life imagine if stu were alive today this movie paints a picture of what stu ungers life might have felt like it was interesting to see how connected was growing up i would have liked to seen more detail on stus partying his gamesmanship and his relationship to bob stupak but all in all this movie was well done well acted and the story touched on many facets of a life that was full of many events that were larger than lifebr br this movie is worth renting,1
i know a lot of people would claim certain films as the worst of all time but i think redneck stakes a claim for this prize a combination of quite dreadful acting from both mark lester and telly savales and plot progression that defies beliefbr br on telly saveles was he drunk when he acted in this he seems to play a slurring laughing lunatic with no sense of conviction maybe he mixed his medication with his whiskey i dont knowbr br on mark lester a performance more wooden than a carpenters workshop his clipped british tones dont belong in this film and his transformation from sheltered teenager to gangsters apprentice in 24 hours is mad and the strip scene with mosquito does not have any relevance to the plot at all perhaps the director likes this sort of thingbr br plot logic when memphis and mosquito ambush the car at the beginning why doesnt mark lesters mother do or say anything to get her son out of the car before the loonies drive it off she just lets them all go without saying a word on the other hand redneck has to be seen you wont believe how bad it is otherwise,0
i thought that this movie was incredible i absolutely loved it even though my brothers didnt that much the special effects were outstanding and this movie is about my favorite sport golf the only thing that was disappointing about this amazing movie is that it is hard to watch two times or more in a row this movie just absolutely tops everything else i have ever seen it was everything i would expect out of a movie i just loved it also it was pretty kidfriendly this movie helped me realize that when you put your mind to it anything is possible i would give it a pure 1010 it was better than the legend of baggar vants and the two pirates of the caribbean movies combined absolutely amazing loved it,1
br br it wasnt the worst movie that i have ever seen however that is only if i get to count home movies made by 8 year olds this movie was horrible from start to finish nothing about it made it worth watching unless you wanted to show new filmmakers how not to make a film,0
this film recreates lindberghs historic flight across the atlantic while touching on episodes in his aviation career through flashbacks stewart was about 20 years too old to be playing the young flier but his fine performance particularly in the solo flight sequences makes this a minor quibble waxmans rousing score is a big plus despite the long running time wilder manages to make it quite exciting and is able to sustain the drama even though the outcome is known what a year 1957 was for wilder besides this he also wrote and directed love in the afternoon and witness for the prosecution and his next two were some like it hot and the apartment what a run,1
the largerthanlife figures of wyatt earp and bat masterson and the specters of george armstrong custer and sitting bull loom over director anthony manns hugely entertaining first western with james stewart although stewarts quest to avenge his fathers murder is the primary story winchester 73 is really an ensemble piece with the eponymous oneinathousand firearm passing through the hands of many colorful owners including a wry trader john mcintire especially great and outlaw dan duryea whos even more despicable than usual the films conflation of fiction and history produces a breezy pace and an ambivalent tone brilliantly in step with manns pareddown compositionally rigorous filmmaking his themes of psychological unrest and past dictating present faintly underlie this tall tale of good and bad men chasing after a fabled gun but they starkly emerge in a vignette about a husbands cowardice and failed attempt at atonement and are defined in stewarts conversations with sidekick millard mitchell manns use of environment is what sets him apart from other filmmakers of westerns instead of gazing at vistas from afar he incorporates them into the drama as characters that redirect complicate or evoke the human characters goals just as mountains caves and rapids had to be accounted for in the naked spur here a gunfight occurs amidst the loose rocks and boulders of a small mountain a physical obstruction that fatalistically determines the roles of victor and victim between two equally skilled sharpshooters i would be remiss in not recognizing cinematographer william h danielss contribution particularly his superlative dayfornight openrange photography not merely an adept outdoorsman mann presents an equally vivid picture of wyatt earppatrolled dodge city primarily through scaled multipleplane staging the shooting contest does not depend on brisk camera shifts or twitchy cuts for effect because mann instinctively knows where to place the camera and how to move it to display the greatest density of information in a given shot nor does he care to spell out the plot in dialogue relying on the actors eyes or a wellchosen image to convey the stakes one scene in particular serves to explain his attitude mitchells telling of stewarts motivation to shelley winters which is interrupted by the climactic gunfight that soon enough reveals all light without feeling insubstantial intense without being overbearing winchester 73 seems more modern than its contemporaries and is a joy to behold,1
oh dear the bbc is not about to be knocked off its pedestal for absorbing period dramas by this one i agree this novel of jane austens is the difficult to portray particularly to a modern audience the heroine is hardly a elizabeth bennet even edmund is not calculated to cause female hearts to skip a beat however i must say i was hoping for an improvement on the last and was sadly disappointed the basic story was preserved but the dialogue was so altered that all that was jane austens tone manner feeling wit depth was diluted if not lost if some past adaptions may be seen as dated the weakness of this one must be that it is too modern his life is one long party the cast was generally adequate but i think billie piper was the wrong choice it needed someone more restrained i gained no impression of hidden depths beneath a submissive exterior she was more like a frolicking child i see i must wait for the bbc to weave its magic once again,0

even if youre a huge sandler fan please dont bother with this extremely disappointing comedy i bought this movie for 799 assuming it has to be at least halfway decent since my man sandler is in it and because i assumed some women would get naked judging by the rrating and scantilyclad women on the cover well there are quite a few scantilyclad women but none get naked im not sure what point this was in sandlers career but im guessing it was even before his snl days i can be wrong this is like watching one of his home movies he might look back at a cheesy movie like this and reminisce about the good ol timesbut we the audience are left to dry this is hardly a movie sandler does a lot of talking to the camera and even admits at one point that this is nobudget movie thats right not a lowbudget movie a nobudget movie so our job is pretty much to laugh at the quirky characters there is no steady plot its like an extended sketch comedy showbut a crude and badly written one that guy who played the nasty comedian was completely annoying and it was implausible in the first place that he would receive such a mass audience and sandler finds his comic inspiration by saying the one classic henny youngman line take my wife please and the audience is on the floor im not even going to try to make any logic here sure sandlers current and recent movies are not known for making a lot of sense the penguin in billy madison the midget in happy gilmores happy place but the comedy works this is a strictly amateurish work and even if youre curious about adams early days in filmyou still wont be interested youre better off checking out his start on snl or maybe his underrated role in mixed nuts of course the sandman is not the only actor wasted in this thankless vehicle billy bob thornton also makes a short appearance billy zane titanic has a supporting role and the great burt young from the rocky movies has a significant role br br this awful comedy will most probably be collecting dust on the 99cent rental section of your local video storeand rightfully so br br my score 3 out of 10,0
what an utter disappointment the score of 61 here on imdb built up some mild expectations but oh my was i disappointed the first thing that bugs me are those braindead stereotyped university kids yes i know teens can be childish and so on but why are they in movies always portrayed as complete braindead morons there was one character that i thought was alright but heshe not revealing it here was killed off way before the end the other characters was poorly executed and even the supposed heroheroine just didnt do it for me on the plus side the plot is pretty good and the productions values a cut above for these kind of flicks the acting was generally not very good rutger hauer stands out in a small role but it all fails with bland and braindead characters you just stop caring about them after 10 minutes 410 and thats being generous,0
the regard of flight and the clown bagatelles as performed by bill irwin are some of the funniest both in terms of physical comedy and verbal and visual gags performances ive ever seen my father taped this special when it first aired in the 80s and my family has loved it ever since we quote it back and forth fairly constantly its a crying shame that copies are not readily available for purchase i have a bad vhs copy that i acquired from a specialty distributer a few years ago but mr irwins performance deserves a proper dvd treatment with a restored version of the original performance and interviews with the performersproducers as well as more examples of modern clowningbr br bill irwins talent deserves more exposure to mainstream audiences than it has enjoyed in his limited wide release appearances i share the regard of flight with friends quite often and though i am always greeted with a small amount of skepticism when i mention that it is a mixture of clowning and vaudeville i have yet to have anyone come away from seeing it without loving it in case the powers that be ever happen upon this imdb listing please consider releasing this and other bill irwin work,1
everything a musical comedy should be gene kelly as joe brady doesnt miss a step and frank sinatra as clarence doolittle doesnt miss a note scenes with them together are very good showing how much talent can add to a somewhat uneven plot sinatras i fall in love too easily is an indication of his then and future best kellys mexican hat dance with a young mexican girl is delightful kelly certainly earned his nomination as best actor and there is a bushel of truly funny lines like you think the navy takes dopes you think anybody sings a sailor to sleep and we got in a little trouble we picked up a little kid a thoroughly enjoyable movie just the thing for shaking off the dust of a recently concluded world war ii,1
minor spoilers as a bad movie connoisseur i must have viewed hundreds of bad movies and yet hobgoblins stands apart from all others in its own unique way classic baddies such as the creeping terror the mighty gorga and manos are uniformly bad from start to finish hobgoblins on the other hand starts off bad and gets progressively worse as it goes during my first viewing of the infamous rake fight scene i thought to myself that this was a truly bad film i was blissfully unaware that i had just seen the best that this movie had to offer the movie takes its most massive nosedive into celluloid hell during the painfully inept club scum sequence which is a continuous string of one unfunny joke after another with just this one film director rick sloane proves that he deserves mention alongside the likes of coleman francis and bill rebane as one of the worst directors of all time how bad can a bad movie be watch hobgoblins and wonder no longer,0
the farrelly brothers bobby and peter are at it again with fever pitch the creators of other films that have dealt with a lot of gross themes abandon that tactic when they decided to bring nick hornbys film to the screen something that it would have been hard to do the novel of the same title dealt with a mans obsession with soccer since it is set in england where that sport consumes most of british sports fans its to the credit of the writing team of lowell ganz and babaloo mandell to transform the book into a language that would appeal to most americans when they make their hero a boston red sox fanbr br fever pitch is a film that presents an obsessive fan ben wrightly whose life revolves into the red sox season and who is an eighth grade teacher with uncanny ways for involving his students into the subject he tries to teach them when ben takes four of his best pupils for a tour of a local firm he meets and falls hopelessly in love with the brainy lindsey meeks a young woman who is going places but at thirty has no life of her ownbr br the story follows the two lovers through the ritual of attending the red sox at home games in fenway park this teams fans are probably the most loyal people in the world having stuck with a team that does marvelous things but until 2004 never won a world series in fact the ending from what we heard had to be changed because that was the year in which they finally won the event that had eluded them for eighty six years drew barrymore and jimmy fallon are perfect as the couple at the center of the film ms barrymore is a natural who always surprises in her appearances in front of the camera jimmy fallon a popular television comedian turned movie actor has a better opportunity here than in his last appearance in taxi in our humble opinionbr br the farrelly brothers film will satisfy their fans as well as baseball fans with this baseball tale,1
this movie start quite gruesomely with a female being bound and psychologically tortured theres male full frontal nudity dead animal parts dogs licking nipples the female loosing control of her bladder all shot in a gray cold color effective but a little too much we then move on to seeing the btk killers youth as well as the present and his history of crimes the tension is entirely psychological and the scenes of the killer entering the homes of his victims and talking to them lasts for quite a long time and its creepy here we dont see fancy or good imagery it looks as if shot with your home camera it doesnt look horrifying but in a way seeing a criminal engage his victims for quite some time before killing them is quite unusual and chilling what this movie doesnt have is any drama really there are some cop scenes every once in a while but theres no excitement in terms of them finding the killer there isnt much of an arc to this story this could have been an effective psychological thriller a study of madness unfortunately the movie is filled with real slaughterhouse footage its dispersed throughout the movie and comes on suddenly again and again sometimes you dont know its coming and dont have enough time to look away and that i have to reject im all for low budget horror movies but i dont tolerate animal suffering it was unnecessary excessive and comes without warning im glad that lionsgate releases stuff that no one else does but they should have passed on this movie or edited out the animal gore stay away from this garbage,0
i can never fathom why people take time to review movies that they have not understood fully i know people will read scathing reviews on these pages of this film and it will keep them from seeking copies of this quite forgotten late 20s style but 1932 movie which should probably be referred to as indecent as that is the name on the main titlesbr br myrna loy best known as a comic actress in countless genteel roles shows herself to be miscast in all of them she was a true dramatic actress something that i did not know before watching this film which predates all of her famous roles she is exciting and moving here two things she never was opposite the graceful and refined william powell im still rather in shock over how good she wasbr br becky sharp 1935 the first threestrip technicolor feature is more familiar but this one is far better artistically and an adaptation it is also very poignant as an expression of a film style that was about to die you cannot take my word for it you must see it,1
beyond the clouds is an overthetop artsy group of four vignettes each a offering a glimpse into a manwoman relationship from the tenuous to the turbulent although the film offers superb cinematography some exquisite visual beauty and a cast of fine performers theres little meat on the bones of this fragmented work a taste of a relationship cannot impart the fullness of it and synergism suggests that much more can be accomplished with one story in 2 hours than with four nonetheless beyond the clouds will be fodder for dilettantes and a visual feast for the all albeit superficial stilted and lacking in substance,1
visitors is a hard hard movie to enjoy its so slow and leaden in its pacing that at times i was drifting off during the film this was about 11am on a hot sunny day i might add not midnight on a cold winter evening so you get an idea of just how slow this movie isbr br strange thing is its not long at 100 minutes its only ten minutes longer than the average straight to video and its only fifteen minutes longer than the superior darkwolf that id quite happily watched the day before it just drags an awful lot enough for you to lose interestbr br when its not mistaking sloow development for atmosphere visitors is good enough at action to almost make it excusable how slowly things happen while the flashbacks are both cheap and annoying as a way to round out radha mitchells boatswoman the hauntingsalienswhatever are actually quite creepy and effective especially when her suicidal mother turns up and starts groaning in the night full marks for not splurging makeup all over the shop too the single person boat is a creepy place and at times the movie uses the full power of the location and the deserted sea to scare the hell out of youbr br still though i find it hard to recommend visitors i came out of it not only feeling like id just watched a 4 hour film not a 100 minute one but also feeling like id been cheated somehow as while offering many explanations as to the hauntings mind games real ghosts space aliens visitors doesnt pick one for definite all that watching radha mitchell talk to her cat and dominic purcell smoulder for no obvious reason about some unexplained horrific event in the past for nothing say what you like about shyamalan but at least he tells you what happened however crazystupid you might think it if you dont watch a lot of these movies your fresh perspective will probably improve matters somewhat but i found this slow boring and highly derivative if you want to scare yourself silly there are much better places to do it if you want a clever thriller there are many that are smarter,0

this show is absolutely ridiculous yes of course its fake but it is agonizing to watch i personally know more creative film influenced minds that could make this seem real the young lead male couldnt be more unconvincing he linereads everything he says are we really suppose to believe he knows what he is talking about there is a plethora of ways to blairwitch this show up fear does not breed from what seems cool and computer generated nor does it generate from such proverbial lines as what was that did you hear that also there are real convincing psychics out there that dont just want to be on screen another duhfactor is how do these producers think we are actually going to buy that paranormal activity will just magically happen within the 2 possibly 3 days if we are lucky they film i dont think so a 2 week at one site would be more convincing it is also disarming that they think including nasa radar checks and computers that show fancy bs really make us scared and ie exorcisms should not be staged like the film the exorcist when are they going to get it right possession of the devil or other evil spirits influence people differently they dont just snarl and lower their voice like linda blair or fallel around like courtney love on a drug binge as stated better concentrations on psychic ability would aid this show greatly we want to see and hear everything that supposingly flashes before them not cutaway to other story bs on a final note shooting stars do not generate interest when you showed fake pictures of ufos ahead of time might i stress again the young dark haired man that hosts this show is absolutely downright awful avoid this show for fright watch old unsolved mystery episodes not the new ones the recreation got it ohso wrong but that is for a different blog,0

what does the executive producer do in a movie if i remember correctly its the person who raised the financial backing to make the movie you might notice in a great number of movies starring sean connery that he is also the executive producer which meant connery himself raised the money since he is a major player unfortunately it should also be pointed out that a great number of movies starring sean connery were solely made because he managed to raise the money since hes a major hollywood player its usually an indication that when the credits read that the executive producer and the star of the movie are one and the same the movie itself is nothing more than a star vehicle with the storyscreenplay not being up to scratch br br protocol follows the saga of one sunny davis a kooky bimboesque cocktail waitress who saves a visiting dignitary and as a reward gets made a top diplomat likely as things progress ms davis who has problems being able to string two sentences together finds herself in more outlandish and less likely situations when i say that protocol stars goldie hawn who is also the films executive producer do you understand what im saying about the storyscreenplay not being up to scratch exactly,0
i just watched it a couple of laughs but nothing to write home about jason lee looked like he was having fun the long dvd gag reel consists almost solely of him having fits of uncontrollable laughter selma blair seemed to be punching a time clock but then again her character was supposed to be a stick in the mud so well done i guess jim brolin was surprisingly funny being married to babs cant be a picnic the soundtrack was hip and eclectic larry miller who played julia stiles father hilariously in 10 things i hate about you is funny here as well hes great but the best aspect of this movie was the casting of julia stiles i could spend two hours watching her fold laundry and i feel like i just did,0
the funniest movie from britain i have ever seen the supergrass is a tale of sex drugs cream teas and murder by the seaside dennis carter adrian edmonson average moron is out to impress his socalled girlfriend andrea dawn french because she thinks he is too lawabiding so to get her to come along with him on a romantic getaway he comes up with a scheme that perhaps will impress her and entice her to spend some time with him trouble is dennis lie is that hes somehow gotten involved in an international drugs ring and while telling her a couple of policemen overhear his boasting and nick him and so begins this witty movie full of slick comedy and crude jokes dennis is banged up in the local nick and much to the arresting officers delight there seems to be no way out andreas earlier attempts to explain it was all a lie were dismissed by a hilarious melody of stand by your man by the two officers then comes along commander robertson ronald allen chief intelligence scotland yard he makes a deal with dennis that if he helps him catch the drug smugglers then he will be set free and allowed whatever he pleases dennis agrees and is teamed up with harvey duncan peter richardson and lesley reynolds jennifer saunders the rest is an unforgettable ribtickling experience with robbie coltrane as sergeant troy adding humourous colour to the film his walk along the drydock against frankie goes to hollywoods two tribes is superb and probably the best scene in motion picture history the two officers who nick dennis are wonderfully played by michael elphick and patrick durkin and alexei sayle as the motorcycle cop is a laugh if you want something good to watch on a saturday night then i suggest you rent this you wont forget it,1

the main reason for writing this review is i found this revisioning of a great play and worthy 1972 film a horrible movie experience if i can save someone from watching it i will have done a good thingbr br this new version is loaded with talent and it all goes wrong kenneth branagh oks an ugly sterile one note set he proceeds to film the movie from every arty distracting selfcentered angle possible we see reflections of the actors in stainless steel on security monitors shots of their heads from 200 ft above close ups of eyes chins and on and on the screenplay by a nobel laureate introduces long stretchs of unpleasant homosexual banter that is being faked by both parties i think given the character twists how would i know the characters themselvesso richly drawn in the original are crass and unsympathetic the running time has been cut by an hour which is either the real problem or the kindest thing the director did for us the actors perform their lines effectively but nothing they say or do is remotely believable jude law is over the top more than caine but as the credited producer must have had branaghs blessingbr br all in all i found this to be an ugly to look at unconvincing shell of a former classic why was it even made the paying public spent less that 4m worldwide to see it a vanity piece of work that fails at every turn,0
last year we were treated to two movies about truman capote writing the book from which this film was made capote and infamousbr br i cannot imagine a movie like this being made in 1967 a stark powerful and chillingly brutal drama elevated to the status of a film classic by the masterful direction of richard brooks elmer gantry cat on a hot tin roof the professional blackboard junglebr br it is interesting that robert blake who starred in this film has had so many problems of late that may be related to his portrayal of a killer in this filmbr br this is a film that stays with you after viewing,1
while watching the film im not sure what direstion it was to take theres a reason a writer shouldnt direct his work and even act in it as well you cant do it all i felt the story really suffered in this film due to the director wearing so many hats ms mcteer is the film to add to her amazing talents her portrayal of this woman was why i was engaged here is a british actress who can do anything in my view conflict is what makes drama and a great story i felt this film didnt have that everything was somewhat easy for the characters there were no real obstacles preventing the chahracters from getting what they wanted watch the film for the sweetness but most of all for ms mcteers brilliant performance,0
the return is one of those movies for that niche group of people who like movies that bore and confuse them at the same time sarah michelle gellar plays a lame buisnesswoman who does not kill vampires or get naked at all throughout the movie i was willing to put up with this however i was not willing to put up with the worst editing ever combined with pointless flashbacks at the end it turns out she crashes her car into herself when she was young or maybe im wrong and that was just a flashback with this movie its impossible to tell can you believe the same dude who made army of darkness produced this crap a much better idea is to stay at home and watch army of darkness on sci fi channel that movie had it all sluts zombies and a dude with a chainsaw for an arm the forgotten didnt even have one of these things,0
i was so disappointed in this movie i am very familiar with the case having read not only mark fuhrmans book but also the far superior a wealth of evil the true story of the murder of martha moxley in americas richest community by timothy dumas anyone who watches murder in greenwich should be aware theyre watching the mark fuhrman story not the martha moxley story this film is nothing more than an egotrip for fuhrman just watch his character strut around as if he is the second coming yes even being ogled by women the actors playing the kids look way too old for their roles and the flashbacks to the 1970s are totally unconvincing if there is any hero to this story its marthas family her mother dorothy and brother john they kept this case alive for two decades before fuhrman walked into it in order to make a name for himself they and martha deserve to have the true story told,0

a noted cinematic phenomenon of the late eighties and early nineties was the number of oscars which went to actors playing characters who were either physically or mentally handicapped the first was marlee matlins award for children of a lesser god in 1986 and the next ten years were to see another best actress award holly hunter for the piano in 1994 and no fewer than five best actor awards dustin hoffman in 1988 for rain man daniel daylewis in 1989 for my left foot al pacino in 1992 for scent of a woman tom hanks in 1994 for forrest gump and geoffrey rush in 1996 for shine for portrayals of the disabled matlin who played a deaf woman is herself deaf but all the others are ablebodied br br this phenomenon aroused some adverse comment at the time with suggestions being made that these awards were given more for political correctness than for the quality of the acting when jodie foster failed to win best actress for nell in 1994 some people saw this as evidence of a backlash against this sort of portrayal my view however is that the majority of these awards were well deserved i thought the 1992 award should have gone to either clint eastwood or robert downey rather than pacino but apart from that the only one with which i disagreed would have been hanks and that was because i preferred nigel hawthornes performance in the madness of king george in that film of course hawthorne played a character who was mentally ill br br my left foot was based upon the autobiography of the irish writer and painter christy brown brown was born in 1931 one of the thirteen children of a workingclass dublin family he was born with cerebral palsy and was at first wrongly thought to be mentally handicapped as well he was for a long time incapable of deliberate movement or speech but eventually discovered that he could control the movements of one part of his body his left foot hence the title he learned to write and draw by holding a piece of chalk between his toes and went on to become a painter and a published novelist and poet br br life in workingclass dublin in the thirties and forties could be hard and the city jim sheridan himself a dubliner shows us here is in many ways a grim grey cheerless place very different from our normal idea of the emerald isle sheridan and daylewis were later to collaborate on another film with an irish theme in the name of the father against this however must be set the cheerfulness and spirit of its people especially the brown family much of christys success was due to the support he received from his parents who refused to allow him to be institutionalised and always believed in the intelligence hidden beneath a crippled exterior and from his siblings we see how his brothers used to wheel him round in a speciallymade cart and how they helped their bricklayer father to build,1
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids a bit predictable the book was better gave more plot details ore about the environment and how the kids uncovered the conspiracy i think hiassens warped humor comes across better in the book than the movie but there were lots of funny moments in the movie as well it is probably a bit too slow paced for kids under 6 yrs of age loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher and those baby owls were adorable i wonder how they managed to film them the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing am i imagining it or did the author carl hiassen make a brief appearance,1
despite a few acceptable adaptations of the books main themes queen of the damnedthe vampire lestat did not stay true to anne ricess complicated story telling the deep layers that build up all the characters were shredded apart to only their surface if not a completely different identity the chronological order of the major events in the movie seemed warped and unevenbr br however there were quite a few things the movie did to deserve my rating of 7 one was that the film strongly captured the affect that lestat among other vampireshad to the public especially young girls the movie also did a fairly good job focusing on the importance of heredity and history that the vampires took pride in the scenes of sensuality were also atmospherically satisfyingbr br the acting in queen of the damned was moderate if disappointing stuart townsend and aaliyah have a surprising chemistry though it only shows when the acting is at its best not very often the characters are nothing compared to the ones established in interview with a vampire it also lacks the emotional intelligence of the feast of all saints which is a shame because rices queen of the damned book had that and morebr br this movie doesnt give all that it appears to be the effects are dull and very disappointing the extravagance needed in many scenes is not given and the dialog is tiring the settings for many scenes are not how i pictured them in the book and i think that many of them werent even taken from the story there are only a few areas of incoherence near the beginning and middle of the movie but it wraps itself up fairly neatly giving the viewer a full story if they had not read the bookbr br somethings that i feel the movie needed include a good original score howard shore or elmer bernstein instead of the mix of rock music though i had no problem with some of the songs another thing that would have made the movie better is better set direction the scenery was boring as well as unclear which is important in a story that moves around quite frequentlybr br overall queen of the damned was an unevenly disappointing yet somewhat satisfying adaption of the important novel with a few simple changes it may have been a very successful piece of film work id recommend this movie for people who has seen interview or have read the books so that they can make their own opinion on the adaption,1
when braveheart first came out i was enthralled and was admittedly one of the most rabid fans of the film when rob roy came out i was intrigued and although i enjoyed the film i did not think it was a great film however as time has gone by my appreciation for rob roy has grown and my enthusiasm for braveheart has diminished braveheart is great entertainment to be sure but there are flaws as well the most significant in my view is the unflattering portrayal of robert the bruce who was without a doubt scotlands greatest king another is the historical inaccuracy of the film which tarnishes the film in proportion to the many historical distortions i think i am also bothered by the fact that it was in this film seen only at least by me in retrospect that the beginnings of mel gibsons egomania can be seen clearly for the first time in contrast rob roy has grown on me over the years partly because it largely avoids the faults i mind most in braveheart but also because rob roy is like fine wine growing more mature and complex with each viewing,1
this is one of those filmspilot that if you knew battlestar galactica it helps but isnt necessary what makes this even more believable of a story than bsg is that this isnt something so far away in the future this has such a depth to it that it is quite astonishing it was not released theatrically the leads could not have been chosen better in such experienced quite talented actors eric stoltz is superb as the father who will do anything to be reunited whis daughter however real or not she is hell do it no matter the cost paula malcomson of deadwood fame is terrific as his wife as well you are not sure completely of his motives whether its love or money or both but that is what makes this pilot even more intriguing i see a star in the making of zoe played by the relative unknown alessandra torresani her performance esai morales is terrific in his desire to see his loved one again just how wrong to be even considering what he wants more than his moral objections i didnt think this would be a good idea when it was announced but from the pilot alone i am thrilled to see how we got to the bsg stage story its great to see adama as a child already being affected influenced by the different sorts of robots starting to permeate life at this stage i just hope that they can keep up the stories so we can figure out even more how they got the the humanoid typed robots this is an almost perfect pilot i hope they can keep up the fantastic storytelling even the visual effects are better than most of the garbage you see on the big screen if you havent gotten into bsg least try this ill bet you become a fan will want to see how the bsg story came to be,1
i loved this film a must see for any rod steiger fan producer suzanne delaurentiis and director stewart raffill have brought us a true family film that touches the soul an incredibly well put together movie with a beautiful soundtrack,1
i have seen quite a few action thrillers in my life and this is clearly one of the best ever there are very few films which i even consider watching several times and this is one of them everything in this movie is just right clint as the superb leading actor rene russo as his nonstupid female partnerthis is a very rare combination sadbut true of course john malkowich deserves a lot of praise for his excellent villain but let us not overlook eastwoods initial buddy played by dylan mcdermott who in my view fits the role perfectlythe soundtrack is absolutely fantastic but sadly never released on an original soundtrack cd shame on the producers the plot makes sense and there is no loss of pace the audience is kept in constant excitement of the outcome of the duel between eastwood and malkowich i give this one 10 stars,1
is this a good movie its hard to say but in 1953 for many people it was a remarkably effective movie suspenseful scary and then amazingly actually touching when the old gentleman meets his unhappy death at the end of the moviebr br yes what lurks in the maze turns out to be something of a surprise and for a lot of people a hilarious one but the basic idea ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny was a very real one at the time the book was written and does have some basis in fact not that it would ever result in what we see in the movie of coursebr br but working on what must have been a very low budget one of the greatest production designers and the person for whom the term production designer was invented creates a very eerie mood that was strangely compelling at times of course the movie is very silly but it has its moments,1
if you like soapseries you might like this film i recommend this film to fans of dutch soapseries like gtst westenwind or even american stuff like the bold the beautiful if you dont like that stuff stay away from this movie it has the same kind of visual style the same quality of acting direction and writingthe film was a big hit at home territory but wasnt sold anywhere else outside holland and belgium pretty strange for a commercial film like thisbr br maybe it says something,0
from all of the vietnam war movies this is probably the most frightening and disturbing and that is really saying a lot with so many spectacular ones that have come out it has this freakish feel to it everything is so chaotic in the movie it scares you it is not like it shows a lot of different things compared to the other vietnam war movies what does push to such a high level is the br br the directing was spectacular here francis ford coppola shows of his talent in his last epic movie unlike other directors he makes you feel as if you are in the war most others just display and show you the horrors of war coppola though makes you feel confused shocked and scared these feelings of war are usually told to us from a movie or story this is something that i have only experienced very few times while watching a film the writing was of course amazing too it brought you write into the middle of the movie it never made me bored and this movie is three hours the cinematography goes hand in hand with the directing which very much added to the freakish experience of watching this film showing all the chaos around you even when everything seems calmbr br the acting was bonechilling just look at marlon brando also giving his last great performance playing a deluded out of whack colonel when ever i think of a crazy gone made soldier i think marlon brando in apocalpyse now with brando n this film you dont want to look into his eyes like the movie he was freakish to me this performance is as memorable as the one he gave in the godfather martin sheen gave a very deep performance and probably the best one of his career making you see everything through his eyes all the craziness he is experiencing and yet wanting him to get to his goal it is just a wonder why these two did not get oscar nominations robert duvall was able to show part of that craziness with his ludicrous battle strategies among those playing music to tell the enemy he is coming also duvalls character asking one of the soldiers to surf in the middle of a battle was just shocking but believable other great supporting performances were given by a young laurence fishburne sam bottoms and frederic forest who all summed up the attitudes of many of the soldiers at that time without becoming a cliché also for once cameos were put into good use having dennis hopper and harrison ford who i both lovebr br i would definitely recommend people to watch this movie it has a message and everyone involved in the making of it is at their best there is nothing more i could ask of this movie with its great acting directing writing cinematography and great ending watch and you will see why it lives up to its title apocalpyse now,1
this movie shocked me it was so realistic and the story was incredible touching they talk german and russian which makes it more believable and real this is a mustsee movie the actors are great too really a good piece of work the plot takes place within a german troop in wwii they have to go to stalingrad sovjet to fight against the sovjetian armies you get more connected with every soldier in this group and follow them through all the perils as they get captured within stalingrad they get facetoface meetings with death blood grief and the coldness of russia this is a mustseemovie and you cant afford not to see it,1
this game is a good looking first person shooter hang onbr br but of course a story must be put around this genre so a quite innovative plot about soldiers now driven by drugs to save the world and kill the terrorist nectar is the drug of choice which creates a super soldier br br great now just give us some fun challenging missions throw in some great new weapons and free terrain vehicles that can be driven at our leisure and i will be quite contentbr br nobr br the makers of this game decide to create a propagandish military driven game that tries to make sense of our fears of terrorism and embracing democracy the game has twisted ideals that just reenforce morals that we learned when we were in primary school nothing new is told to us but drugs are badmmmkay then pushed in a type of yvan eht nnnioooojjjjj join the navy of how standing up for the common good given rants on normality and abnormality right and wronggooooooooood we get it lets kill somethingbr br nobr br you cant you are forced to endure extremely long gaps of completing bullsht objectives such as run to helicoptergo to group of troops then once this is completedcinematic takes overyou sit there for at least half of the game watching little scenarios played out by the characters ones you cannot skip but sit and wait sometimes when people arent even talking we sit and wait for a helicopter to land br br bad game by a laughable group of programmers dont bother making another because i will rather see the movie,0
when i rented this i was hoping for what reign of fire did not deliver a clash between modern technology and mythic beastsbr br instead i got a standard monster hunts stupid people in remote building flick with bad script bad music bad effects bad plot bad acting bad bad badbr br only reason why i did give it a 2 was that in theory there could exist worse movies in theory,0
you know i really have a problem with movie lists i was reading maxim magazine a while ago and they had a list of the 50 greatest bmovies of all time and knowing me i of course have to go through and watch them all and write reviews of all of them this is why you see reviews of movies like gator bait and barb wire and coffy on my list so i noticed hots at the video store the other day and recognized it from maxims list of the 50 greatest bmovies and i decided to rent it and check it out my only consolation is that i rented it because i recognized it from a list of bmovies so i already knew it was going to suck br br given the type of movie that it is i cant say that hots is a total failure since it is nothing more than a late 70s ta film and it never pretends to by anything else the only place where it strays widely from its objective is in a ragged subplot involving a couple of excons who have stashed a lot of stolen money in the house that the selfnamed hots move in to because this subplot has absolutely no place in the movie despite the fact that the rest of the movie is as well this subplot is completely superfluous and unnecessary br br the story is based on a couple of rival sororities at the beloved fu which exists as one of those universities that contains a grand total of one sorority until the rejects form their own in order to get back at the snobs in the other one this new sorority help out the seals hots is a sorority supposedly based on helping seals the seal subplot is another one that doesnt really belong in the movie and little attention is paid to the meaning of that name beyond having a seal running around here and there throughout the movie br br this is going to sound weird but there was actually one scene that i was pretty impressed with in this movie one shot that i was impressed with i should say about midway through the movie one of the girls in pi the rival sorority is pouring alcohol into the punch and she pours some for herself in a glass and drinks it oddly enough what she does as she drinks that alcohol reminds me of something that charlie chaplin would do which really brightened up the movie obviously nothing in this movie comes close to anything that chaplin ever did but that shot alone raised my score for the movie from a 2 to a 4br br as a whole however the movie is exactly what you would expect it to be a lot of people running around looking for excuses to take off their clothes i liked how the removeonepieceofclothingforeveryscore in the football game at the end was one of the girls ideas riiiiiiiiight and not much thought is put into much of,0
normally i try to avoid barbie films but this one was unmistakably awesome kudos to the graphics and character voice overs it all flowed well this enchanting tale is a great spin off of others but is well worth buying i dont have kids but the kids i babysit including boys find it intriguing and love the extra features on the dvd i honestly dont know why this is rated so low but for kids especially your barbie lovin 8 year old will love this its not straight forward and predictive like most movies are this childrens film has excellent morals and shows teamwork it has no swearing bits of romance if your old enough to figure it out and beautifully written storyline thats why i am giving it a ten out of ten,1
this is a story of a long and awkward love the daily life of a woman of 50 years old and some people around her is depicted her daily life is so ordinary and routine that i doubted who was the real lead character in the beginning then the audiences know that the woman and a man who was her highschool class mate had very tiny connection the woman has been doing the same job a milkwoman and a supermarket casher so long there are so many slopes that delivering milk bottles is a very hard job the man had married another woman who is now dying of cancer he works at the city hall and devotedly cares her at home they never look straight nor talk each other but they never forget each other br br the original japanese title means at some time the days you read books but of course when the man said now i want to do what ive always wanted to do it was to hug her and make love with her she writes to a radio disk jockey that if god gives us time to talk we need at least a whole day dreaming of that day she has been sublimating the desire in hard work and book reading i personally know a woman who has loved a man for long years even after he married another woman and died for an accident therefore the story setting is not that special rather this movie well portrays unspoken romances in many ordinary men and women through this movie you will recall your romance that is lost long ago this is a movie with lasting effect,1
ok i will admit it started out very pleasing and good but then it just dropped downhill i cannot believe sarah michelle gellar could have even finished reading the script after about 5 minutes into the movie the only reason i actually sat through the whole movie was i wanted to see the twist at the ned and to my surprise well folks i cannot even tell you if there ven was one because the end just leaves you confused and then the credit role i was like what the hell this did not deserve a theater run i am sorry but it didnt i mean it was horrible the only reaso i gave it a 4 is because it had a few jumpy partsthats it you can watch it im not telling you not to hey you might even like it or even love it but if you hate it dont say i didnt warn you,0
get the cd instead the show is tame and the editing sucks the crowd gets way too much screen time as does till lindemann the cameras spend more time on the same kid shaking his head around in the same way which leads me to believe its the exact same shot than they do during richard kruspes solo in weisses fleisch the scenes change so quickly its impossible to tell where the camera is pointed and the replays are simply redundant not worth the tape its recorded on,0
documentary content amazing man amazing movement he started amazing stories most of them yet to be really toldbr br celluloid treatment nike ad sorry aint got nothing else to say about this but that you can say all you want about the dire circumstances in the favelas but if you attempt to support that claim with flashy and romanticized images and camerawork of that life the humbleness necessary to show this life as an outsider filmmaker goes out the window and with that goes the legitimacy of the narrative besides that the timespace continuum in the film is all off and im not necessarily against that in films as a tool but here it serves only to confuse the viewer into wondering what was said when thus leading me to the question is this a documentary or a docudramabr br cococravescinemablogspotcom,0
iron eagle has always been one of my favirote films for a long time now it looks like topgun but with a different plot and a lot of people will disagree with me here in my view its better than topgunbr br this film has some amazing dogfight scenes when the fighter jets are zooming through the air it also has the queen song one vision thumping in the background which in my opinion is a fantastic songbr br to be honest iron eagle was very good but its sequels were rubbishbr br,1
years before prenuptial agreements became a regular thing ernest lubitsch made a screen comedy on which they are the basis bluebeards eighth wife involves gary cooper as a multimillionaire living on the french riviera whos been married seven times and now marries claudette colbert for number eight but coopers a good sport about it he always settles with his exwives for a 5000000 a year as per an agreement they sign before marrying him sounds like what we now call a prenuptial agreementbr br of course claudette wants a lot more than that and she feels cooper takes an entirely too business like approach to marriage shed like the real deal and is willing to go some considerable lengths to get itbr br bluebeards eighth wife has some really funny moments the original meeting of cooper and colbert in a mens store where cooper is insisting he wants only pajama tops and colbert looking for only bottoms and of course my favorite is colbert trailing and blackmailing the detective cooper sends to spy on her herman bing has the best supporting role in the film as that selfsame flustered detectivebr br ive often wondered how back in the day hollywood could get away with casting so many people who are nonfrench in a film like this of course cooper is an american and colbert of the cast is the only one actually of french background though david niven is charming as always having him be a frenchman is ludicrous he is sooooooo britishbr br nevertheless bluebeards eighth wife is an enjoyable film and a great example of what was called the lubitsch touch back in the day,1
i think south park is hilarious and i have no problem wthem taking shots at people on the left but youd think that after taking a whole movie to attack celebrities for risking their careers taking on an illegal war and then being gasp right along they would have the sense to start giving w and the bastards ruining the country a shot or two bush seems to get a pretty free run from these guys for as stupid and messed up as he isbr br gore is fair game but please what do the republicans have to do how bad do they have to fk up the country before these guys finally act like maybe they arent just trying to do the best they can and that they have done some true screwing upor maybe just go after rush limbaughhes a good targetor even just make fun of condoleeza rices gap teeth,0

i found this film to be a bit too depressing i dont mind dramas but this was a bit too much for me luckily there does seem to be somewhat a decent outcome i suppose it was well done id watch it again but its nothing to rave about,0
i watched this film many years ago and have searched for it ever since in my opinion although very raw it is very educational as to what the future can hold i enjoyed the movie and to this this day rate it very high sorry to all those that disagree but a movie should always be judged each to there own and in my opinion its great give it a go with all the cloning and test tube babies that are happening today who are we to judge this film this may be a dramatised event of what is to become but there you go all the horrors of today are so far fetched even i laugh but this one gets me thinking and it scares me as a mother what if i was desperateafter watching this movie i would think twice sorry but i love the movie make your own mind up dont watch the movie making just aknowledge the story and ask yourself this how far would you go for a child,1
i was stunned by this film afterwards i didnt even want to see any films for a long time any other film would be so unsatisfying by comparisonbr br for many it may be the worst of antonioni very slow without an engaging conventional story line microscopic examinations of human emotions and interactions and the worst of wenders verbose confused transcendentalism it is composed of short distinct episodes linked by wenders typical meandering heros stream of consciousness so it doesnt produce the temporary oblivion of escapist cinemabr br but for fans the worst is the best and the disjointed story line is sketching a single poetic image that stretches across the film wenders and antonioni create a discourse between their segments that seeks out the heart of thingsbr br,1

i didnt really expect much from the night listener and i actually never heard of it until i saw the cover in the videostore however the movie is very effective when it comes to building up suspension and tension on occasion it drags a little but it actually helps to keep you wondering whats going to happen and more importantly when as the movie progresses the character played by robin williams gets dragged into some kind of cat and mouse spiel to the point where he becomes obsessed with finding out the truth and existence about a 14 year old abused kid that noone seemed to have ever seen in person the night listener is an interesting story which is great in building up the suspense throughout the movie and youre pretty much kept in the dark of who is lying and whats real however in the end it kind of disappoints and doesnt live up to the potential it could have had it doesnt really give you a detailed or plausible explanation about the other main character which would have been helpful and interesting,0

not only was the plot of this film contrived with the ease in which the two psychos are able to kidnap a pregnant woman without breaking a sweat but it was a terrible ripoff of misery however the main reason i gave this film such a low rating was because it absolutely disgusted mebr br im not someone easily shocked by what filmmakers dish out and have always had a love for horror flicks but this film went too far purely in terms of violence and torture just for the sake of getting points in the shock factorbr br i think most people when watching just the first ten minutes of hide and seek will find themselves reaching for the remote,0
waterss contribution to the world of cinema has to be searched with a telescope and then whenif something is found by sheer chance and lots of luck it has to be analyzed with a microscopebr br and after it has been analyzed it would get discarded into the labs rubbish bin for totally useless things one single atom of that microscope is worth all of his movies combinedbr br cb is etremely campy and intentionally so the usual jw stuff comicstrip dialogue simplistic plot moronically cheerful characters chewinggum pop overacting etc waters knows that he is incabaple of making a movie of quality so he hides behind the mask of the intentionally cheesy filmmaker which supposedly makes him a special kind of antiartist but in the world of cinema being an antitalent often gets mistaken for talent which is exactly what waters had hoped for and eventually got its a con act charlatans infest the world of cinema and modern pop art its a plaguebr br perhaps we have john waters to blame for inspiring baz luhrman to make all those horrible dumb turkeys its like a virus one waters creates five new bad directors and then these five each create more and so on where will it end with dancer in the dark can that bomb actually be topped,0
as can be read in many reviews here it is a movie you love or hate apparently not so much space for opinions in between i for one think that is a good sign br br i always appreciated this movie although the genre is not my typical style i never watched titanic for instance and am not planning tobr br the english patient grips because it shows how people can be different when they are in an exotic environment as opposed when they are home katherine it shows how destructive love can be in a slow strong and utterly painful way it excites because of the extremely passionate affair the pain of the ones who leave behind how pointless one can feel to move on br br the photography is just stunning not to mention the play of the actors the pace is slow but timely and that does justice to the book the timeline and the depthdevelopment of the characters to put this in 110 minutes as some seem to suggest here would amputate the multilayeredness of this movie people tend to have difficulties with the pace of movies as if they are in a rush to get to work hey get a life enjoybr br i give this movie 45 out of 5,1
the untold is one of the worst films i ever saw the story really seems original but it was badly bestow on screen lance henriksen a good actor ended up in this crap but hey he made a lot of low budget films you need to pay the bills you know kidding lance is a great actor but he ended up with this bunch of silly actors seriously andrea roth was there just to have a nudity scene and other actors well they were just there there was constantly a fade outfade in editing and that makes me sick that was the most horrible move that just keeps on coming and it really makes you angry it was also very predictable boring and slow it has a bizarre tempo that goes just wrongbr br cant say more dont rent it or buy it you can watch it if on tv,0
it is difficult today and in the us to understand this movie we have nothing really to compare it with here is an attempt at comparison it is as if during the last years of saddams rule a filmmaker in iraq were somehow able to make a film which for the first time ever showed life as it really was lived in that country the life of ordinary young girl with all the terror and the repression full blown then the film was exhibited freely in iraq if you could imagine that unlikely event then you might have an idea of what went on with this film in the last few years of the soviet union prior to this film soviet cinema was highly censored soviet movies would only show an ideal life in the workers paradise then suddenly this the alcoholism the random sex the ugly wasteland that was the soviet city the choking pollution the proletariat victimizing each other and themselves the utter hopelessness it is all there people were stunned soviet women would often weep during the showings many would say that this is the story of their lives it was a cultural earthquake the like of which filmmakers only dream of accomplishing it undoubtedly hastened the breakup of the soviet union br br reading the reviews here i can see that few understand this film one says it was groundbreaking because it contained real sex to the soviet viewers at the time the sex was a minor event compared to fact that it portrayed reality for the first time in soviet cinema br br others compare it to current films such as as good as it gets might as well compare homers illiad to the latest john grissam novel they simply do not compare this is not just a film this is was a social document and a transforming social force it needs to be viewed that way or you will not understand the film br br other reviewers see it as a film about a dysfunctional russian family one even says that it is difficult to feel sorry for vera because she keeps coming back to her family the point is that vera and her family are symbols for all of soviet life there was nowhere else to go because the family down the block and in the next town were the same this was life in the soviet union for most people br br this is a film that can be viewed on many levels as a drama it traces the landscape of despair as a social document it shows the living conditions of the time as a political document it shows the attitude of the people and many of the reasons for the breakup of the soviet union and as a moral document it shows the evils of a dictatorship that is out of control and the cruelties that victims will practice on each other br br little vera clearly shows the human toll that socialism eventually takes on its victims despite any good intentions,1
this movie took the jerry springer approach to superhuman power wilder napalm is the kind of themebased movie that i love addressing the idea that prodigies in america are defined either by their gifts or by attempts to hide them at the same time the movie points out that every prodigy is only human and no more to be feared or worshipped than any other human being this was a great comedy fun and human with that slight satiric edge,1
from the first scene i was really excited i can tell this is going to be awesome i thought the acting was so good i felt as though i was eavesdropping on these peoples lives the music too was exquisitely unsettling the plot started with a sudden event and then drifted forward one could sense toward some irrevocable fate the build was slow but i personally love that kind of thing as long as the quiet tension stays on track and doesnt get derailed before its ready to pay offbr br so everythings going fine and then the fireworks begin and before you know it the credits are rolling what was all i and my movienight companion could say if you understand the directors intentions the blunt ending does make sense for those of you who have seen the movie already check out the very fascinating and hilarious interview with larry fessenden at filmcriticcom but i cant help saying it was not pulled off quite rightbr br this probably could have been resolved with as little as ten more minutes of material before the climax in any case its too bad those ten minutes could have made all the difference in the world but for those of you who dont write or make films you should know that crafting a story arc with the proper timing is a huge pain in the butt and i am certainly not making this critique from any kind of pedestalbr br wendigo feels to me like a masterpiece that was given up on before it was finished but hay id take a blunted masterpiece any day over an overproduced piece of dogpoo overcompensated with too many digital effects like most horror movies these daysbr br one other comment some of the monster scenes left me confused as to whether i should be scared or laughing i dont know how to explain it but there was a distinctively monty python feel about this monster in his more blatent monster forms although this may sound like a terrible criticism for a horror moviei dont know it still worked for me in some crooked way i will never look at deer antlers in the same way again,1
kite runner is undoubtedly one of the most amazing books i have read in the recent past i perhaps had very high expectations from the film but none the less the movie was good the entire setting seemed realistic nothing was made to fancy the dialogs were not very attractive or powerful they were just right the movie was not a bad experience at all especially at the last 15mins where it got real emotional and even the hardest man would probably crybut my imagination was far better than the moviei cried more upon reading the novel than seeing the movie but overall a good movie to see for those of u who are not readers but the readers the novel would be a better experienceso if at all u want to see the movie read the novel first and then compare it to the movie,1
a swedish splatter movie has the world gone insanebr br probably not but its still not a common sight in these days with swedish goreflicks the bmovie business in sweden seems to have troubles these days long gone are the golden days of rymdinvasion i lappland and this movie seems to have some troubles on its own its just too much talk in it it still manages to be somewhat amusing mainly for the good fx which are great for a bmovie the script and most of the acting is still pretty bad though but that actually dont matter that much its supposed to be a gore flick and nothing more thats where it goes a bit wrong for some reason theres is simply not enough blood to fill the void br br every person who know about gert fylking will have a good laugh over his role as a sgt though i nearly laughed my ass off its really that hilariously bad br br besides the good parts ive listed theres really nothing else to recommend here unless youre starved for swedish bmoviesbr br 410,0
the brave one seems to indicate that the main character of course is brave id disagree the more brave thing to do in a situation like the one that happens to her getting brutally beaten along with her fiancée who doesnt live another day from it is to go after the criminals without resorting to a total distorted view of society jodie fosters character erica is a radio personality whos niche is walking the streets and recording what goes on were given no real depth aside from she had someone she loved he died the police dont pursue it she gets a gun yadayadayada she gets somewhat but not really involved with the lead detective into the character and so were left with something leftover from past movies the vigilante code of justice where taking the power in ones own hands is all there is but were never too sure if erica is sane or not if the filmmakers take a position one way or another that is until the end which is such a stupid message to take anyway dog included as overbearing metaphor while making the new york city of today which has become significantly safer than say twenty years ago look like youll get knifed or beaten if you go down just the right alley or just sit alone on a subway carbr br there could even be a somewhat better movie in the midst of all of this perhaps just in the undercooked subplot with terence howards detective who is involved in some custody battle of a child that isnt his and a woman who hes not linked to and a stepfather who i dont know what aside from owning parking lots and being a bad dude but were left to a script thats both hamfisted and disjointed with logic it becomes laughable for example to see that at first the logical side of erica unable to really shoot properly as seen in her first shooting in a convenience store at the convenient moment of a robbery of a wife by the husband and then giving way to the illogical of her crackshot at shooting at a pimp driving a car head on at her and killing him and ducking just in time to not get run over it doesnt help that jordons style with the camera becomes a little more than insufferable its called a stedicam for a reason not because it can weave in and outbr br ironically the script and direction become very good or rather work the best they can under the desired circumstances when looking at the actual beating scene under the bridge caught between a videotaped point of view by one of the criminals by the regular film cam in a pace that is perfectly disorienting and when erica first comes back on the air to her radio show and she freezes up trying to do her old shtick and speaks out a fromtheheart about how afraid she is this scene from fosters performance to the clear direction and script is the,0
i watched the trailer on the dvd after seeing the film and i think anyone who saw it before watching the film would be very surprised and possibly disappointed it made much of the fact that the film was by the director of cube and made it look like a horror film when in fact it is an absurdist comedy imdbs spell checker doesnt seem to think that absurdist is a word but it is reminiscent of rosencrantz and guildernstern are deadbr br i love the way the story builds up slowly at first then gradually escalates i also enjoy the fact that no explanation is given for what happens in the film that and the fact that the story plays out mainly in just the one set are the only respects in which this film is similar to cube i recommend it,1
lets see here are the highlights of the brain machine 15 establishing shots of a pool and a house 15 establishing shots of a nondescript office building 5 countdowns by a bland technician 7 closeups of a menacing guard and a myriad of technical babble to show us this is a hightech experimentbr br various posters have commented on the discrepancy between the copyright date of 1972 and the release date given on the dvd box of 1977 thats an easy one to explain this dog simply sat on the shelf unreleased for five years until someone dusted it off thinking it fit in perfectly with the postwatergate mood of distrust in government after seeing the brain machine now my only wonder is that it ever got released at all,0

george mildred the movie lacks the talents of its tv writer john mortimer who brings the close quarter cut and thrust of georges class war with the fourmiles alivebr br the plot is cut from standard spinoff cloth hitmanmistaken identity and has as little tension as there are laughs the producers should have taken a leaf from rising damp also 1980which was also bought to the big screen after the tv series demise and kept much of the story in familiar settingbr br yootha joyce died in 1980 but she should not be remembered for this creaking piece of work encumbered as she was by her illness mildred lacks the sharpness of her tv incarnation cutting asides and withering looks largely directed at georges lack of libido georges sputtering incredulity also gets lost in the more expansive sets this is not to say that they were much to shout about the budget for this movies looks pathetically small a restaurant they go to is clearly a new semistarched house with some christmas lights adorning the front doorbr br for fans of 70s british comedy or those who just want to revisit an old tv companion from their youth this film can add nothing to the experience and they should just stick to the first four tv series out now on dvd,0
this film was made soon enough after karens passing that perhaps richard carpenter and the people closest to karen were feeling a little guilty as to how they may have contributed to her health problems as the years have passed almost 25 to be exact it must have gotten easier to deny any complicity richard has spent the years after karens death endlessly remixing and recompiling the recordings he made with her he married his cousin mary and from what i have read it looks like he may be planning a next generation carpenters with his children he seems to have regretted making this filmand that may very well be why it is unavailable in any form it seemed to me to be a fairly honest assessment of the tragically short life and incredible talent that was karen carpenter,1
i was so excited when i discovered this was available i couldnt wait to see it what a waste of energy its kind of like that rarities cd by your favorite band you found in the back of the rack at your local music store being a hard core fan you were certain that it was a valuable discovery but once you heard it it became obvious why these dogs never made it onto a real album this dvd is only recommended for completionists who must have everything lynch has done six men getting sick is somewhat visually interesting but short and repetitive it lacks the power of lynchs later work the grandmother is quite simply an immature work its tedious and looks like a student film but it was the 70sits interesting only if you hope to psychoanalyze the director but you can see briefly the seeds of some of his trademark images and sounds the alpahabet is forgettable no really i cant remember this one at all the amputee is pointless the cowboy and the frenchman is just plain silly lumiere is the only worthwhile one in the bunch without dialog lynch tells a disturbing tale comparable with his best work i had to watch this one several times but it runs less than 2 minutes hardly worth the trouble of renting or buying the dvd,0
i loved this movie it was all i could do not to break down into tears while watching it but it is really very uplifting i was struck by the performance of ray liotta but especially the talent of tom hulce portraying rays twin brother who is mentally slow due to a tragic and terrible childhood event but toms character though heartbreaking knows no self pity and is so full of hope and life this is a great movie dont miss it,1
after reading the mostly glowing comments about this movie i decided to rent it despite some suspicions of tv movies i should have followed my instinctsbr br i tried so hard to warm up to the movie and find merit in it but i just couldnt the story never draws you in or rings true and the acting is perfunctory at best and laughable at worst everything in this production is amateurishbr br always a joy to watch mary mcdonnell may be the only performer to escape this disaster without damaging her career or reputation i wont even bother checking the name of the leading man hopefully hes back doing commercialsbr br even poor vanessa redgrave whom i adore and respect seemed to be channeling katherine hepburn all the time appearing as if she were really drugged in the home maybe she needed the moneybr br if i can save one person from wasting 100 minutes on this tripe i will feel vindicated,0

gilmore girls is my favorite tv show of all times they only aired the first 2 seasons in india but ive watched the rest on dvd or read it online its very refreshing to find a show where the protagonist isnt sneaking around her mothers back but has an open relationship with her the chemistry between lauren graham and alexis bledel who play lorelai and her daughter rory is really great all the acting is excellent and the characters though extremely quirky are still believable the residents of stars hollow show all the amusing bizarreness of small town life which is contrasted by the endless snobbishness and social norms that make up the high society life of lorelais parents on one hand there are danceathons and firelight festivals while on the hand you have cotillions dar meetings and cocktail parties all the characters develop a lot and theres a happy ending for more or less everybody there are dramatic elements but also a lot of very witty humor rorys boyfriends are all incredibly hot as are her friend lanes basically its a cool funny very satisfying show which encompasses all the aspects of life and gives you a feeling of if you work hard enough and wait patiently youll get what you want even if it wasnt what you intended,1
the mother is that extraordinary piece of film making it gets you thinking it pulls no punches and ultimately it leaves you thinking very much openended as to the lead characters fate anne reid which i only knew briefly from her appearances in some victoria woodled projects and thought a fine comedienne is truly superb here not the stereotypical widowed housewife that was perfect in marriage and motherhood at all and not all that freespirited and adventurous at first she plays her character just with the right note that rings true well it did to me powerful cast great script renaissance of european cinema indeed,1

after viewing the film i was truly shocked to see such a high rating on imdbbr br the fantastic mr fox is an adaption of a beloved childrens classic portraying the story of the smooth slick protagonist mr fox or foxy as he attempts one last heist to steal from the dreaded boggins bunce and bean thats right one short one fat one lean or however it goesbr br i dont quite know where to start with my criticismbr br well im in my late teens and was never a fan of roald dahl but i like his material well enough having read a few of his books as a child and seen matilda and charlie and the chocolate factory over and over again this film however struggles for an audience is it aimed at children adults im still unsure many of the jokes would bore a child especially as mr fox visits a lawyer for example or complains about being poor also an audience of im assuming children is expected to sympathise with a character who steals and kills chickens im all for the food chain but you practically see mr fox biting down on their necks surely thats a bit much and also the plot well its kind of boring i stayed only with the hope of it getting better but instead i just got more and more annoyed at mr fox and his son ash for making stupid decisionsbr br the humour meanwhile falls flat i laughed only once or twice even though i specifically recognised attempts at jokes i think part of it is that the voice acting is so incredibly flat and monotoned the voice actors have no sense of comic timing instead aiming for the subtlety of humour that only works with certain mediums george clooney aims to portray mr fox as charming and sleek but his voice has no character meryl streep shows no emotion i didnt even realise bill murray had a role until the end credits and ash twelveyears old in foxyears sounds like hes about 30br br i love animation particularly stop motion but the visual style actually creeped me out a little bit characters are tall spindly and lacking any warmth of design they move with very little fluidity and often the animation is jerky and strange there is also a distinctive mixed medium feel as 2d components are added in sporadically and unsuccessfully characters look straight at the camera and talked it was very awkward there was one or two moments when kylie looked straight at the camera didnt move and had swirls on his eyeballs it actually freaked me outbr br fantastic mr fox had so much potential lots of people still seem to like it look at the reviews maybe it just wasnt for me,0
for muslim women in western africa married life at the hands of abusive husbands can be very hard the community may not explicitly endorse such behaviour but equally they may not yet be ready to see it as criminal an attitude which of course enables it to continue fortunately the letter of the cameroonian law promises equality to all and this documentary follows the real life exploits of various female practitioners in the cameroonian legal system as they attempt to secure justice for a number of women and children what is notable apart from the uplifting central story is how in spite of their informality the courts are actually pragmatically progressive if a case is actually bought the program also gives a fascinating insight the whole cameroonian lifestyle which aside from the awful crimes committed in the featured cases seems amazingly emotional and joyous compared with that enjoyed by inhabitants of europe or north america and while i concede that this comment may betray naiveté on my part this attitude appears to be captured in delightful pidginenglish they speak overall this is a terrific little film and much more fun to watch than you might imagine,1
kannathil muthamittal was simply one of the most touching and sincere movies ive seen in a long time the story of an adopted girl who on her 9th birthday learns the truth about her parentage she sets out in an endeavour to find out more about her real mother and learns that her mother is now a terroristbr br the greatness of the movie lies in its simplicity mani ratnam generally has a tendency to create unreal and pompous overblown characters in this movie every person seems real and their interactions are touching and sincere this is the reason why this ranks as one of his best moviesbr br the movie is emotionally draining and tugs at the heart of the viewer keerthana as the 9 year old amudha and simran as her adopted mother are simply brilliant their relationship is the cornerstone of this movie there are some notable flaws here particularly the scene where amudha learns that she is an adopted child is jarring and seems totally unreal it is hard to believe that such sensitive parents would break such a news in the manner that they did another flaw is surprisingly enough the brilliant songs they again seem forced and stand out not gelling with the rest of the scriptbr br having said these this still is one of the most poignant and beautiful movies to come out of india in a long long time this beauty is not just in the script or characters but in teh technical brilliance as well ravi chandrans camera work is sheer poetry all characters perform creditably and the realistic humour especially in teh flashback scenes are entertainingbr br a sincere 9,1
the overriding problem with this film is that it cant possibly use bill murray to the best of his abilities simply because of the costarbr br if this was a road movie with another comedic actor it might work even if they were both trying to get the elephant across the country it would at least allow for them to share some amusing dialogue as it stands murray is left talking to an elephant who cannot answer back with witty banter essentially it means that murray is talking to himself and this makes the film more boring than it could have been had he had another character to bounce offbr br kids would enjoy this moviesimply because of the elephant but anyone wanting to watch bill murrays biting delivery and enjoy an excellent script needs to look somewhere else,0
i read somewhere in a fairly panning review that this is something of a liveaction mecha anime and i think theyre on the right lines i first watched this movie when i was very young and ive been dying to see it again and when i finally did just recently all the memories came flooding back i dont think this is to be taken too seriously its just a bit of good old 80s almostatvmovie fun it is set against the backdrop of a fairly dark future although this point isnt stressed too much what i admired most about this movie was that the dialogue didnt sound generic no clichés no predictable lines all in all just good fun maybe time hasnt been kind to this little movie but still i can find appreciation for it in me its by no means perfect but its entertaining and doesnt try to be anything other than that let the nerds and comicstoreguys worry about technicalities who cares see it for yourself and make your own decision noone elses opinion matters,1
a wonderful movie about people i first saw four friends when it was originally shown in theatres and ive seen it many times since if im not watching it when its on tv ill get together with friends and rent it invariably the people ive watched this movie with find it enjoyable it deals with friends from childhood to adulthood in the 50s and 60s its very funny and touching dealing with first love and first sex racism war politics the whole 60s shebang it can also be quite dramatic if you enjoy movies about people this one is definitely worth the time,1
this is an interesting series that takes real life people jesse james john wesley hardin etcand dramatizes part of their real story with a continuing series character taking part in that story railroad detective matt clark takes a role in tracking down famous outlaws from the old west in stories that are at least partly based on the true accounts in that sense its almost an anthology series and as someone else pointed out this odd structure poses some timeline conflicts with the real events but its a fun series with plenty of action to satisfy a westernhungry 1950s audience and it still holds up pretty well 55 years later clark cuts a powerful figure in his western gear as he goes up against some of historys baddest baddies and his girlsidekick frankie is quite a dish if youre a western fan be sure to check it out if you have a chance,1

incredibly vampire assassin is significantly worse than such atrocities as tequila body shots and zombie nation and those movies are terrible writerdirectorstar ron hall is devoid of both charisma and acting ability and is also clearly incapable of the most basic directorial concepts possibly the worst camerawork editing lighting sound visual effects music and fight choreography i have ever seen in a movie rarely do two shots cut together nor can you see much in the beyonddim lighting the terrible dialogue is spoken extremely slowly by a supremely untalented cast stretching the movie to a neardeadly 87 minutes this is a truly laughable embarrassment for everyone involved obviously aficionados of terrible filmmaking will want to see this but its very hard to sit through no matter how experienced a badmovie viewer you are the fact that ron hall thought this was actually releasable is astounding if you are a movie director and you actually think its ok for the opening credits of your movie to include a few frames of the words slug before the title appears left over from your rough edit and you apparently cant muster the energy to edit those frames out then your standards are obviously so low as to be insulting i am astounded that lions gatemaple agreed to release this movie on dvd in spite of rudy ray moores very brief cameo this movie is a work of supreme selfindulgence on ron halls part he clearly thinks he is a formidable actor and must also believe he possesses superior writing and directing skills but the movie is so unbelievably inept that its hard to believe hed actually want people to see it for fear of being brutally excoriated like im doing right now a jawdropping insanely terrible movie im not kidding,0
whatever happened to british tv drama from john major through tony blair the focus of the genre appears to have shifted from social realism to smugly normative womenfocused tales about the piddling domestic problems of nice middle class professionalsbr br or perhaps tvnz doesnt buy the good stuff please let that be what it isbr br the writers long career in soaps probably explains why the dialogue is made up mostly of stale clichés niamh cusacks performance is strong on meaningful looks each held by the director for at least half a dozen beats longer than they deserve baleful looks however are a poor substitute for depth of character if the writer has failed to provide such material for actors to work with br br of course this is theoretically a thriller about a murder investigation but thats not as important as the central characters failing marriage and its attendant problems is cusacks characters husband a complete bastard will her son be utterly traumatized by the marriage break up making these the central issues isnt a sign of insight it indicates a profoundly narcissistic identification by the writer and director with a character who should be getting on with her jobbr br lynda la plante knows how to write this stuff so that it feels as if it matters and involves viewers other than housebound neurotics evidently paula milne isnt up to the task,0

on the outside this film is better because of vincent donofrio law order criminal intent but this film is equally as good as the 1982 version in some ways the 1999 version is better because its more up to date a decade as compared to the 27 years the actors in this film were great like terry kinney mcmanus of hbos oz as james daly and tony shalhoub usas monk and gary sinise csiny obvilubuly dialogue was changed for contemporary audiences nut much of the writing remained the same there were stuff that wasnt in the 1982 version that gave this one a boost in drama and comedy but in the end this film was just as great at the 1982 one characterwise vincent donofrio playing phil romano was excellent better that paul sorvino its a match up between stacy keach and terry kinney in terms of james as for george i would praise shalhoub and between martin sheen sinsise as tom i would say sinise wins,1
the second coming of suzanne is yet another one of those surrealistic films that tries to come across as extremely sophisticated yet all it does is put the viewer to sleep like other movies of this type there is limited dialogue everyone is much more interested in the visual aesthetic of the shot however the cinematography stinks so there is nothing at all to keep your attentionbr br the video box states that this film is one of the most exciting visual adventures ever seen on film yeahsure its right up there with watching such stimulating events as a bucket of ice melting or a turtle walking for a mile 110,0
the 1960s were a time of change and awakening for most people social upheaval and unrest were commonplace as people spokeout about their views racial tensions politics the vietnam war sexual promiscuity and drug use were all part of the daily fabric and the daily news this film attempted to encapsulate these historical aspects into an entertaining movie and largely succeededbr br in this film two families are followed one white one black during the first half of the film the story follows each family on a equal basis through social and family struggles unfortunately the second half of the movie is nearly dedicated to the white family admittedly there are more characters in this family and the story lines are intermingled but equal consideration is not given to the racial aspects of this centurybr br on the whole the acting is well done and historical footage is mixed with color and black and white original footage to give a documentary feel to the movie the movie is a work of fiction but clips of wellknown historical figures are used to set the timelinebr br i enjoyed the movie but the situations were predictable and the storyline was onesided,0
renaissance 2006 was created over a period of six years cofunded by france luxembourg and the united kingdom at a cost of around 14 million the final result is a staggering accomplishment of comicbook style animation aesthetically similar to what robert rodriguez and frank miller achieved with sin city 2005 but this film employed motion capture with liveactors to translate their faces and movements into an entirely animated format presented in stark blackandwhite the film looks as though it has been hoisted from the very pages of the graphic novel on which it was based and the futuristic city of paris looms ominously above us directed by french filmmaker christian volckman in his featurelength debut renaissance draws significantly from other films in the sciencefiction genre and the technoir storyline isnt something we havent seen before but from a technical standpoint it is faultlessbr br the year is 2054 the city of paris is a crumbling metropolis filled with dark alleys and deserted footpaths the recent installation of modern technology merely offering a thin mask to the pitiable degradation of the darkened buildings the citys largest corporation avalon achieved wealth through offering citizens the promise of beauty and youth and the companys research department is continually striving to invent greater means of eliminating the aging process ilona tasuiev voiced by romola garai in the englishlanguage version which i watched a brilliant young scientist is mysteriously kidnapped on her return from work and so it falls to legendary detective barthélémy karas daniel craig to uncover her current whereabouts possibly holding the key to the womans disappearance is bislane catherine mccormack ilonas hardened elder sister whose trustworthiness is in question and jonas muller ian holm the dedicated medical doctor who adored ilona as his own daughterbr br the eerie dimlylit city of paris is reminiscent of ridley scotts blade runner 1982 and some of the technology looks as though it might have been borrowed from tom cruise in minority report 2002 which was coincidentally also set in the year 2054 however despite this familiarity volckman has created an exciting world for his characters to inhabit blending classic filmnoir and sciencefiction the result is an eyecatching collage of harsh lighting and dark shadows which i should warn occasionally becomes difficult on the viewers eyes the dialogue is a little banal at times and the story though engaging doesnt offer anything strikingly original except for the ending which i thought was a bold twist on the usual formula but renaissance is intended to work best as a visual treat and that it succeeds in this regard cannot be denied,1
i shot this movie i am very proud of the film it was a great experience which shows up on the screen halfdan hussey is an excellent collaborator who had a vision and was able to capture the movie in the exact way we envisioned while prepping the film the sets are amazing and well crafted for each character john york and his team built sets that not only fit the characters they worked well in shooting the film allowing us to move seamlessly through walls and from one set to another each character has an amazing arc which makes for a great story i feel like all of the actors gave excellent performances i disagree with some of the other comments that say the acting was not good watch it and decide for yourself,1

i normally dont like romantic films but i love this film very much the story is really touching and the ending is very appropriate i feel i really care for many characters in this film i feel i can feel their feelings while most romantic films always make me feel detached and bored this one completely makes me feel involved starting from the scene of capshaw running along the beach with scott until the ending scene i want to rate this film 11 out of 10 because i want to give an extra one point for the ending the acting part is very strong kate capshaw has a good opportunity to show her talent though im not impressed with scott in dead man on campus this film completely changes my viewpoint towards him hes so irresistibly charming here geraldine mcewan is as terrific as everbr br this film might not be as good complex deep or believable as other films which deal a little bit with the same kind of relationship such as lecole de la chair or post coitum animal triste but the love letter can still be proud of itself as it casts a rare different light on that kind of relationship and that difference makes this film eminently enjoyable by being unambitious and relying on great charms of small stars dreamworks this time you really make my dream come true,1
this is a joke right this cant be a real film its not even a real video give any harvey milk high school kid a video cam and they could make a better movie than this the film makers cant be serious right is this satire comedy drama gone horribly wrong the script is about as singleminded and dull as is conceivable ten monkeys locked in a room with a laptop could come up with a better screenplay the dialogue isnt clichéd clichéd dialogue might elevate this holiday mess to something akin to camp fun but it doesnt and it isnt worst of the worst a landlady wanders into a dramatic scene in a private apartment dressed a bathrobe carrying a frying pan like something out of a honeymooners episode whaaa i have seen better acting from middle school drama clubs one of the leads is an attractive lunk the other is not both cant even manage a convincing kiss so much for romance the supporting players are jawdroppingly overthetopbr br everything is underscored by a nauseating soundtrack and the sound seems to have been recorded in a back room toilet most of the dialogue is mercifully unintelligiblebr br this stale cinematic fruitcake isnt even worthy of being the next rocky horror or a gay holiday installment of mystery science theatre 3000 its just plain bad in every way visions of sugarplums will not dance in your head they will trample your every expectation have an eggnog and stare at mindlessly at the neighbors holiday lights it will be time better spent,0
what a great movie this is so reminiscent of the wonderful disney classic family movies of the 60s and the 70s i was so pleasantly surprised after the past 20 years of absolute detritus disneys live productions crews have churned outbr br this movie is an absolute joy the child stars were just that professional quality actors i am most impressed with the quality of this moviebr br sigourney weaver was a total sycophantic insert hyperbole here running a prison camp for wayward boys siobhan fallon was wonderful as the stars motherbr br i wont recant the story here as there is little point in doing that yet again but the story is wonderful the direction was extraordinary and the acting quality was superb this work reminds you what its like to be a child without going all sugary or being too grim the deleted scenes featured on the dvd version were truly best left deleted they were too harsh for this movie and would have taken so much from it while the abuse was hinted in the finished product it was not outright shown beyond a certain extent it was best that waybr br this was an absolutely delightful movie to watchbr br it gets a 910 frombr br the fiend,1
this review contains spoilersbr br i was searching through horror movie dvds on amazon when i came across flight of the living dead i already knew from the name that it was going to be abysmally naff and most probably a ripoff of snakes on a plane but it was selling brand new for 69p so i figured i didnt really have much to losebr br the music played over the opening credits didnt fit at all although i did like the song itself a poprock song isnt really suitable to appear on the soundtrack of a zombie horror movie it started off surprisingly well the opening scenes werent too bad some of the acting was a little cringeworthy but not as bad as i initially thought it would bebr br it all goes well until laura cayouette rocket from kill bill vol 2 enters the picture she is supposed to be playing a scientist if she is shes not a very bright one luckily shes polished off pretty quicklybr br i actually physically laughed out loud when the camera panned over the passengers of the plane during some turbulence there was a nun have you ever been on a plane with a nun i was surprised she wasnt clutching a crucifixbr br finally after 35 minutes we get to some zombie action and use the word action loosely the special effects are pretty below standard but thats to be expected from a movie with this budget being covered in blood and having yellow contact lenses does not make you look like a zombie though it makes you look pretty amusing using slow motion doesnt work particularly well either i think this movie is probably guilty of trying to add too much story trying to pass off the problem as a variant of the malaria virus wasnt an especially good move either considering malaria isnt a virusbr br the rest of the movie pretty much plays out like any other zombie movie most of the characters are killed off and it eventually ends up with a handful of people fighting to stay alive possibly the worst part of flight of the living dead is the utterly inconceivable ending i know its a movie about people who come back to life and feast on the living but the ending was just ridiculous rating,0
ok so i am like most people give me free tickets and i will go and see most things now that multiplex cinemas are so good i remember the old flea pit single screen cinemas and i am the healthy side of 40 in england this film was released as liar its a dog it is a total waste of good celluloid 410 for the photograpy and set only,0
no one is going to mistake the squall for a good movie but it sure is a memorable one once youve taken in myrna loys performance as nubi the hotblooded gypsy girl youre not likely to forget the experience when this film was made the exotically beautiful miss loy was still being cast as foreign vixens often asian and usually sinister shes certainly an eyeful here it appears that her skin was darkened and her hair was curled in most scenes shes barefoot and wearing little more than a skirt and a loosefitting peasant blouse while in one scene she wears nothing but a patterned towel i suppose im focusing on miss loys appearance because she is by far the best if not the only reason to tune in to this creaky antique and to keep watching you sure wont be attracted by the dialogue which is hopeless in one typical passage nubi gazes out the window at the departing caravan and waxes poetic always the gypsies they sing weird and sad when the big sun have breath of fire that burn and when the pale moon look from behind cloud and breathe air cold as death they sing poetic or what lovers of purple prose will have a field day i cant help but wonder though if in her later years miss loy preferred not to recall her involvement with this projectbr br like so many early talkies this one was an adaptation of a recent broadway success the stage version opened at the 48th street theatre in november of 1926 and ran for over a year the play provoked a famous episode involving the humorist and theater critic robert benchley who was known to have an aversion to characters who spoke in thick dialect or pidgin english according to a muchrepeated anecdote mr benchley squirmed uncomfortably through the opening portion of this show the spanish village setting moved to a village in hungary for the movie for some reason gave the actors leeway to practice their accents with varying degrees of success but benchleys patience reached its limit when during a family dinner sequence a door burst open and an actress dressed as a gypsy girl dashed into the room shouting help help he keel me she then threw herself at the feet of the mistress of the household and exclaimed me nubi me good girl me stay here at that point mr benchley rose and announced to his companion me bobby me bad boy me go now and left the theaterbr br the film version offers numerous examples of unintended humor but never comes close to benchleys level of wit the melodramatic plot concerns the lajos family father josef mother maria and son paul a student at the nearby college we would consider this prosperous family uppermiddle class as they are landowners with servants and all the comforts of life but their comfortable existence is abruptly thrown into turmoil when a gypsy caravan arrives in the village and their home is invaded by yes nubi the nubile gypsy girl,0
the acting itself wasnt even that bad since it didt come to mind in the movie but whatever had this director in mind the intended climb towards some climax completely missed the markbr br almost all scenes involve acting that stand so far from our own intentions and way of reacting on things that you dont really attach to any actor in the moviebr br empty silencesin this case see through cheap method of boasting your way into potential metaphorical brilliancewhich just wasnt here at allbr br i guess im bitching but shit2 hours of my time,0
it was libby talking to desmond in the flashback and if anyone is confused about her past like how did she end up in the same hospital hurley was in then you should know that despited libby dying in season 2 the character will be explored more in season 3 and we will get answers to questions surrounding herbr br btw great episode it had a really great cliffhanger and some interesting questionslike what happened to eko and lock and what about the four toe statuebr br i cannot wait till season 3 lost just rules i hope all the unanswered questions will be answered i loved how they explained why the plane actually crashed desmond did it when he did not manage to type in the numbers in time 4 8 15 16 23 42,1
at the beginning i was happy to know about a new superman movie i though that will be great but it wasntbr br is a bad copy of the richard donner worklex is again a villain that makes no more else even played by kevin spicebr br the evil plan is the same of the first movie of donner just a lot forcedbr br the script is predictable and simple all stuff luthor finds in a museum or an old ladybr br the story is the wrong thing it must be the kevin smith script and may be it could be betterbr br i just hope a sequel without brian singer and with a new talent director to do something new and not a copybr br all read you later,0
oh god why i am aghast at the sheer ineptitude of this delicious blathering nonsenseas if all that makes sense well like this film from bottom rung poverty row of 1940s hollywood nothing in this door slamming horror made on three sets makes much senseexcept the horniness of dr markoff jerkoff who lusts uncontrollably after some plonky pianoplayers daughter who has big melons and a flouncy hairdoo it is just terrible and even has a gorilla and a big dog for pointless added distractions more elephantine than elephant man and that is just at 62 minutes the monster maker is the sort of film kids in 2005 just howl at with disbelief and wonder what the hell their grandparents saw in their youth that made them the lovable movie kooks they are today i guess you just had to be there in 1944 or whenever the hell this mad drivel was shown to impressionable 13 year olds in glorious 3000 seat velvet movie palaces on a wet day somehow it was made for no reason by botchville crapshooter movie scammers prc pictures in the war years by escaped german refugees who knew who to make a film since they got out of europe as the nazis advanced on ufa studiosthe monster in this film like the mad scientist is actually a nazi nightmare,0
somewhere out there there must be a list of the all time worst gay films every made ones that have overlong camera shots of the stars sitting and staring pensively into space or ones where they focus unbearably long on kitty kats eating spaghetti this motion sickness picture is a story of a boy and a boy and they live and love and swim and get stuck in grottos and one of them has a depressed mother and another has no mother and they talk and walk and swim and have sex and get drunk and then break up and someone goes to the hospital for eight days and then gets out and there is a lot of fast forward and rewind and there are long pensive shots of one of them looking into space or just sitting and doing nothing i think its some sort of gimmicky film making technique or maybe its that the film is so bad they have to fill it up with long wasted shots because otherwise if they had to rely on plot or story the film would be about 14 minutes dont get me wrong this is about the 30th gay film ive watched in the past 6 months and some of them most of them have been very formulmatic predictable and boring but this is one is really a terrible waste of time the best one so far was beautiful thing so i watched this and after the very first opening shot which lingered and lingered i thought oh no its going to be creative sinny mah but i gave it a chance and watched it and then when it ended i tossed the dvd in the trash sorry i didnt like it and if you did sorry if i offend,0
linda blair has been acting for forty years now and while she will never escape the part of regan macneil in the exorcist few of her subsequent horror films have used her legendary status to such great effect as witchery does she plays jane brooks a pregnant single woman who travels with her family to an abandoned island hotel that her parents want to purchase they are accompanied by a couple of real estate agents catherine hickland and rick farnsworth and upon arriving at the island they meet a photographer david hasselhoff and his writer girlfriend leslie cumming who are illegally squatting in the hotel while investigating the legend of a local witch hildegard knef it seems that a longago witchhunt resulted in her suicide and she was with child at the time unaware of the danger jane has recently dreamt of the witchs dramatic death and janes little brother tommy michael manchester has been more directly visited by her spooky blackclad spirit which he calls the lady in black the groups time at the island inn begins quietly enough unknown to them however the lady in black has already dispatched the captain of their hired boat george stevens before long the isolation and cold begin to affect everyone and it is during this period of moodiness and tension that the lady in black begins her reign of terror she plans to avenge her own fate by possessing jane and sacrificing her companions and her unborn child each of her other victims fulfills an aspect of her vengeful curse greed lust and the blood of a virgin as the sun goes down and the sea becomes wild she haunts them one by one in gruesome horrifying ways the island location is effectively scary and the inn is very creepy and hauntingly shot its such a colorful film that it reminds me of dario argentos work the lighting is excellent and the set decoration is perfectly spooky the soundtrack is very effective and unique the horror effects are extreme terrifying and unforgettable the cinematography is great and it is this that brings us back to linda blair the creative team behind this film shoots her like a horror star should be shot lots of dramatic pushins lingering closeups that subtly detail janes incremental possession and moments that are reminiscent of other great horror films there are hidden homages to rosemarys baby jacobs ladder the shining black sunday and of course the exorcist she does a great job and absolutely steals the show with her moody and understated performance that isnt to say that the rest of the cast disappoints catherine hickland is sexy and very good and veteran performer annie ross is memorable as janes bitchy mother rose hasselhoff gives it his best but he is not essentially a film star and his television persona gets in the way of his performance blair and young michael manchester have a wonderful chemistry together the film is otherwise so violent and creepy in a good way that it desperately needs their warmth blair also played,1
this pof s was highly recommended to me by two friends that have greatbr br similar to mine taste in films and have seen more than anyone i knowbr br i have no idea what they saw in this movie sadisticcruel and repulsive is fine in an entertaining moviebut this is a windbag effort trying to pass itself off as highbrow lowbrow movie makingor is it lowbrow highbrowbr br the ancient generation gap cliché no redeeming social value comes to mind bill pullman is tryingmaybe a little to hardand except for the kid the rest of the acting seems selfconscious and kinda lamebr br save yourself from this and watch a double feature of in cold blood and the hitcherbr br as somebody said this would never have been made if jennifer lynch was not the overrated david lynchs daughter,0
this movie was pathetically awful the sound was terrible the action was ridiculous and the effects were nauseating if you have a life dont see this movie cause you will want to kill yourself this movie totally rips off blade which is undoubtedly a really good movieor trilogy i should saybr br i dont care who the actors are this movie is just horrible i watched 10 minutes of it and had to come to my computer and comment on how absolutely just bad this movie is i actually dont know why my family is still watching itoh wait yes i do they are laughing almost nonstop at the stupid action dialogue and acting,0
first off im an american i havent seen any comments on imdb about this series yet from a us viewer secondly i work in the television business in development so i wallow in much of the sludge that comes out of american broadcast programming unit one is an example of television thats a throwback to what i would attribute as 70sstyle scripting featurewise namely those films made by young autueurs who had free rein to make the dramas feel more realistic and to allow for organic character development it tacks more along the lines of stellar british dramas like cracker and prime suspect as well as australias brilliant underbelly unit one features standalone cases that are committed then solved each week the mysteries arent extraordinary or particularly byzantine they usually center around one single twist clocking in generally at the 40 minute mark and resolution is neatly wrapped up in the 15 minutes thereafter what makes this series a breath of fresh air is that it features main characters that you are hooked on and find relatable by episode 2 these are real breathing alive characters that have personal baggage yet its not a talky batty type of baggage that american flotsam such as greys anatomy or desperate housewives spoons out these are realistic individuals whose backstories unfold leisurely over the course of the series as if you work with them on a daily basis after the mindless decade of csis nciss and criminal minds along with their subsequent spawns its refreshing to actually sit down to watch friends you want to spend time with as is the case with unit one the quippy banter the unemotional wooden dialogue and the overthetop jeopardy that those american series i mentioned bludgeon us with each week are absurd compared to the nuance and the quiet resonance you get with this remarkable danish series im on episode 7 of the first season but ive already bought all four seasons and am in for the long haul if you need explosions and farcicallyhopped up testosterone along with music by the who and fastcutting neonlit jittery palsycam action with cipherlike main characters as your main diet of television drama viewing i suggest you stay away from this series if you are an adult with a hunger for subtle poignant thoughtful and yes sometimes straightforward procedural crime dramas i urge you to check this show out,1
i caught this movie late at night on cable and i was pleasantly surprised i can only imagine the reason this movie was not better known is because the subject matter is very disturbing but if you can handle the sexual abuse topic it is a well acted suspenseful and very interesting movie both richard gere and claire daines are very good in it and although the subject matter is not for the faint of heart the movie doesnt go out of its way to be brutal either like 8mm for instancebr br i highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys serial killer and suspense type movies,1
seven young people go to the forest looking for a bearsoon they are all stalked and viciously murdered by a crazy vietnam veterantrampa infernal is a pretty entertaining mexican slasher that reminds me a lot the zero boysthe film is fastpaced and there are some good death scenes like throat slashing or axe in the neckunfortunately there is not much goreso fans of grandguignol will be disappointedhowever if you are a fan of slasher movies give this rarity a lookmexican horror flicks are quite obscurei have seen only alucarda and dont panicso this should be another reason to see this enjoyable slashermy rating7 out of 10highly recommended,1
this film is a tapestry a series of portraits of rom communities woven together by music its very much a musicians film because of the paucity of spoken dialogue and what dialogue there is is not important to the structure of the narrative some might expect a national geographic tale of customs dress and music or a plotline orbiting a few central characters dont look for that herebr br this is because it paints a portrait of a family of peoples rather than telling a story of individuals the plot is the story through space india to andalucia andor time we cannot tell of a people there is no need of narration you get a sense of a joyous people strongly linked in small communities where social interaction is very important and a great sense of sadness in parts at their rejection by society at largebr br so its a paean to rom culture very beautifully shot with a wide spectrum of rom music and a sting in the tail which is the oppression these people have faced and still face,1
kannathil muthamittal is for sure a great movie i have to give it to mani ratnam for a great directing job and ar rahman for great songs the camera work is just excellent and is similar to black hawk down and saving private ryan i will be shocked if this movie does not win an oscar for best foreign film or even best camera work,1
i am not exactly how sure the accuracy is with this movie but i can tell you that i was thoroughly entertained by this movie the character of gustplayed perfectly by phillip seymour hoffman was one of the most unique yet entertaining characters in recent memory this movie informedyet managed to avoid preaching to the audience it made me laugh made me sad made me feel alive and glad to be spending the time to watch the movie it takes no time to understand what is going on and takes you on a roller coaster ride of genuine human emotion i thought i knew my history apparently i didnt know it at all i give this move 9 out of 10 and recommend it for all adults and young adults and the young at heart just not the young but as soon as they are allowed to see r rated movies make it a priority,1
oh the horror ive seen a lot of gore movies in my day but this one just makes me gag with with laughter rather than repulsiveness this is definitely a crazy movie and is very lowbudget i might add but if youre able to look past the cheap audio horrible dialogue ugly girls the obviously fake gore scenes and overall cheeziness of the film then you might find some of this film to be somewhat entertaining the story is about a copy cat killer who goes on a killing spree every 5th day of the 5th month of the 5th year wow how original and its up to two detectives one of whom gave a valiant effort at trying to make the crapy dialogue good to stop the killers bloody rampage the killing scenes which are done with a plastic toy knife are pretty brutal which is a good thing but very annoying due to the constant repetition of an obviously recorded scream which is very ear piercing as for the gore theres plenty of it but it looks very fake especially the blood dude cmon purple blood but if youre a fan of gore videos like myself then youll find something in this video to cherish like i did the craptalking detectivehes the best thing going for this film other than that all youre going to find is a bunch of senseless nudity which is also a good thing but too bad the girls are ooogly and a very idiotic hippy necrophiliac serial killer sorry but this one sucks,0
phewi dont what to say this is a film that could be really good a with a bunch of stoned viewers some of the acting reminded me of john waters early offerings perhaps i should take that backi dont want to insult waters ability as a directorstorytellerbr br i particularly loved the lawyer taking about the full faith and credibility clause its full faith and credit by the waybr br this also reminds me of the conrad boys where the main actor is also the writer director film editor etc those sort of multiinvolved undertakings such as that are probably best left to very seasoned film professionals who would have the technical ability albeit a stunt some might say to pull something off like that,0
holes the novel was forced on me in an education course i didnt think i would like a childrens novel plus the other couple of books i was forced to read for the class were really bad but to my surprise i absolutely loved holes it really is one of the most perfectly written novels ive ever read i think it has the rare quality that makes it appeal to preteens teenagers and adults everyone who reads it i think will walk away a better person while i cant quite say that for the film i am happy to say that they got it mostly right i dont think viewers of the film will walk away as enriched but they will certainly be entertained without the side effect of being stupider when they sat down it is an intelligent story and its very well told i think it moves a tad too quickly the novel takes more time in developing the characters and the flashbacks come in and out so quickly that they dont have too much time to register the interracial romance in the past feels more cliché and trite than it does in the novel and the ending which ties together all the loose threads seems very ridiculous its exactly the same in the novel but theres a sense of the absurd that doesnt quite exist in the film it works a lot better i also dont like the multitude of pop songs i wish disney didnt feel it such a necessity to sell soundtracks the cast is acrosstheboard excellent from the young kids to the old pros jon voight is especially great not quite sure why we need catwoman and the fonze though 910,1
worst movie ever made please see the real movie reviews from the pros on this moviecheck rotten tomatoes on the web for some good independent reviews on this film the comments made on this site are apparently from folks with some financial interest in this film i find the positive comments very misleading i find it amazing how the negative comments are so bad against this movie and the positive comments sound like an academy awards speech dont waste your hard earned money this film is retarded i cant believe a film like this would ever be made why would hollywood waste their time on such junk this film is an attempt at nothing i ask myself what looser would actually sink their money producing such trash i went to blockbuster and the attendant even told us not to waste our time or money i didnt listen and i did waste my time and cash please dont make the same mistake it really is the worst movie ever made,0
inherited this from my xs dvd collection when he left with my best friend enough said watched it one night when there was nothing on the telly nothing new there then and got a very pleasant surprise very british you no hardly any budget no faces you know or have even seen before the accents were a bit thick for my liking but after a worrying start a bit too close to home in my case it began to grow on me apart from the some unnecessary jokey cutting that really didnt add anything i found the film throughly uplifting very real natural performances throughout left me wanting more from an ending that came suddenly too soon highly recommended,1

not really worth a review but i suppose its my duty to warn you all especially since there are some pretty good reviews of this canadian bomb floating around out there bad acting and a slow moving absolutely atrociously boring coming of age tale in which 3 boys lives are turned upside down when a man on the run shows up at their clubhouse in the woods at firs the boys make good with the intruder and at one point even view him as some sort of a role model however all this changes and you still wont care you will recognize chris penn whose biggest cinematic impact is corky romano and a young devon sawa whose career peaked at casper i was hoping for a 12 and holding the war or lie and all i got was a waste of time this film struggles to keep its audiences attention and never makes an impact or maintains a note of anything remotely interesting,0
sitting down to watch the 14th season of the bachelor on the wings of love i knew i would be in for an interesting time i had watched some of the previous seasons of the bachelor in passing watching an episode or two and missing the next three or so i find that the bachelor is often appealing and intriguing though its quality and morality are often lackingbr br on the wings of love details the journey taken by jake a 31 year old commercial pilot from dallas texas to find true love as true a love as one can find in a seasonlong realitydrama dating show jake meets 25 beautiful girls from all over the country he begins to get to know them a bit but it is mostly superficial how well can you get to know someone in a few 5 minute conversations jake tries to make his true intentions known from the very beginning at least to the audience he noted that he doesnt just want love or a good time but he wants a fiancé or wife we can only assume that he has made this clear to the women in the competition as well if that is the case it might explain to a degree some of the womens actions the women are super competitive while they dont even know jake at all yet they are still in it to win it no matter what the costbr br not only were the women competitive but they were also confident and catty threats backstabbing and warnings of watch out all show that these women werent there for a good time either jake noted that he was not just looking for sex appeal but looking for a connection however the girls pulled out all the stops to try to impress jake with said sex appeal they arrived at the mansion in skimpy dresses either lowcut or shortbr br while some girls seemed to maintain their sense of decorum others missed that memo altogether one girl channy noted that jake was a good guy to whom she could be a naughty girl she went on to say that jake could land on her runway anytime she got flack from the other girls for her provocative statement which showed their take on these situationsbr br so a reality dating show couldnt be that bad could it besides the obvious issue of sexdriven attraction there are other issues that mar this seemingly harmless show is this the right way to find a future mate vying for someones attention by flaunting oneself to extreme proportions unfortunately however that is what america has reduced dating to these days pleasure and sex without commitment and a little happiness on the sidebr br another problem is the premature emotional attachment by which many of the girls bound themselves to jake a few girls in particular seemed to be overly attached one girl said if i dont get that first impression rose it will kill me as mentioned before they dont even know him yet and she,0
my take on the ending bobby died at the hands of his step father mike had tried as he may to get bobby out only a child could think that it would be possible to build a machine that could fly bobby died mike as a child survived by creating an alternative ending in his mindon how bobby leftmike made a plane that flew bobby out children who are sexually and violent abused often create whole other worlds in their minds to survivebr br was also great seeing my old housing area we called it san jose boulevard and i lived right around where these house were filmed it was so strange to see that they filmed inside the housesnot studios it was my kitchen bedroom and living room and those hillswe use to hike them as kidslooking down on our little valleyseeing glimpses of the bay was a real nostalgia trip for me,1
what can i say about oceans twelve who thought that it would ever come to this a gigantic mess that loses itself halfway and cant retrace i found myself amazed at how bad this really was really i have never seen the ending properly because this film is just insufferable im a huge fan of the first but this is a lame excuse for a sequel br br what was the point of the heist if they were going to give the money back the movie is just boring and so drag along that i cant ever sit through this it really is bad just stay as far repeat far away as possible from this movie its worthless,0
lauberge espagnole collected the audience wherever it was shown it gathered audience awards on many film festivals all over the world and it is not strange we have the ability to watch a cheerful and an astonishing piece of art and it is wise by the way lauberge espagnole is a very funny comedy about youth and growing up but most of all it is about the lights and shadows of living in the european unionbr br the main character of the film is a french student of economy xavier for his future carrier his is sent for one year of studying to barcelona in spain it turns out that the lectures are being given in catalonian language that probably doesnt help the increasement of knowledge but it helps in tightening the relationships inside the group of foreign exchange students especially if they rent a big flat together there are 3 girls english belgian and spanish as well as three boys german danish and italian our french guy will also get there a year is a very long time long enough to get close and make friends and get to know some european stereotypes while trying to break them apartbr br klapisch treats this special case of a process of uniting europe with humor and without pecky didactism he comes out of the idea that young people are everywhere just the same they like jokes they like to make irresponsible relationships but they dont neglect their aspirations the most interesting is the sum of experience of this little community they live together in the fire of everyday tasks fighting with the surrounding reality they are full of unusual ideas for life young europeans come back to their countries to take up a life of an adult on their own they are europes hope to fight the many problems of the union for example the terrifying administration system in the end they proof that not only can they communicate and make friends despite the many differences but they also now how to live the full of life and they wont allow taking that full of life away from them,1
ive seen this at the fantasy filmfest in cologne and left the cinema halfway through this movie with a bunch of other people so maybe im not the right one to comment on it but i think the fact of leaving sc is reason enough to do so sc is a different film people who need a coherent narration characters or a plotline wont find anything in this one its supposed to be an experimental film relying on the power of images but these images have no power they are so forced in their intention of simply grossing people out that they have nothing else to say the gibberish of the offnarrator is simply boring the visuals are cheap ok the effects are good but if thats the only thing why care husseins film wants to be shocking and thoughtprovoking instead it is boring and annoying in its noncreativity note not every movie without a story is art and there is absolutely no creativity in breaking taboos anymore especially not if everything is executed as bad as in sc id suggest director hussein should either visit a psychiatrist or a filmschool before he mistakes crap for art again note i never want to see a baby getting slashed during birth again,0

havent seen this film havent even heard of this film it wouldnt surprise me one of the few truly independent films produced in the last ten years no studio had faith in the picture and it was never picked up for major distribution the independent company kino films gave boesman and lena a very limited run with virtually no promotion and the majority of major film critics didnt even bother reviewing it i guess a movie based on a one act one set play about the apartheid and its affect on two individuals never really had a chance in todays market and its the intelligent filmlovers lossbr br for the record both angela bassett and danny glover deserved ocsar nominations as did the cinematographer but the film received such little fanfare that i cant even blame the academy on that one this is a film that is challenging thoughtprovoking and heartbreaking and it actually requires the audience to meet it on its own terms taking that into consideration it is definitely not a movie for mindless entertainment director john berry wisely does not attempt to dressup athol fugards play sure were given a few fractured flashbacks and some breathtaking scenic shots but the film version of boesman and lena remains on the whole a story of two people living in inhumane conditionsbr br stripped of their basic human rights boesman glover and lena bassett have no one left to attack but each other a third character joins them for awhile willie jonah amazing in a largely silent role but the films focus never strays from the title characters and what theyve become bassett and glover give brave performances as the broken couple performances that simply could not be improved upon vigorously and brutally stimulating both intellectually and emotionally boesman and lena deserves to be rediscovered of home video hands down the best film of the year 2000,1
this stan laurel comedy short is a cute little parody of the valentino film blood and sand if youve seen blood and sand then youll probably appreciate this film and laugh at a few of the scenes that mock the valentino film however if you have not see that movie and just watch this film youll probably not be very impressedthough i really liked the title cards us the word bull was used repeatedly in very funny waysbr br stanly plays vaselino a bullfighter who seems pretty dimwitted and wins only because the bulls seem to lazy and nonaggressive even the bull at the end of the film who has supposedly killed ten men is obviously just a domesticated bullbr br not a great film by any stretch of the imagination but still a cute and harmless film,1
the message of hero is quite clear the idea of greater china is more important than the death and the suffering of millions at a time when china is dangling its war toys over taiwan it is unacceptable for western viewers to endorse this piece of overproduced governmentsponsored dogmatic trashbr br particularly surprising is the promotion of this film by the liberal media roger ebert of chicago tribune david edelstein of slate charles taylor of salon and many others have wholeheartedly endorsed hero in so doing they have implicitly legitimated its reactionary political message the only critic that i know of who saw through the films glossy facade was j hoberman of the village voice who wrote of the films sanctimonious traditionalism and its glorification of ruthless leadership and selfsacrifice on the altar of national greatness i for one sign my name under hobermans final pronouncement hero is nothing more than fascinating fascism,0
as with most rosalind russell movies this one is very entertaining its fun all the way through its definitely one of the last of this genre of film just good wholesome entertainment give it a try i dont think you will be disappointed,1
when i heard the plot for this movie i simply had to see it i mean whole cities being wiped out by killer tomatoes sadly the title is about as funny as it getsbr br led by detective dick mason a special team of military and scientists including greg colburn who never takes his scuba outfit off and lt finletter who is never pictured without his parachute trailing behind attack of the killer tomatoes is a parody of bmovies in particular japanese horror of the 1950s the film begins with a standard sized tomato being discovered by a women washing up in her kitchen before we find ourselves in a middle of a crime scene as the tomato has supposedly murdered this lady and let me tell you it doesnt get any saner as the film progresses to be fair there are a couple of funny moments for instance anytime the japanese scientist dr nokitofa speaks his voice is dubbed over in an american accent or when disguise expert sam smith infiltrates the tomatoes hey can somebody please pass the ketchup equally this film was probably a lot funnier in 1978 with the whole so bad its good concept unfortunately for attack of the killer tomatoes spoof films such as the airplane and naked gun series have been released and done this kind of comedy a lot better sincebr br the acting is atrocious there is zero continuity in the editing and it just feels genuinely slow and lacking energy for a parody film to work you need a lot of things happening at once one gag after the over the singing in the film seems pointless and the adverts for the furniture store that flash across the screen are damn right bizarre even for this film ultimately however you can see why this film is a cult one i cant see many people being indifferent to it unfortunately terrible would be the way i would sum this up,0
wow you guys are way too nicecornycornycorny that is how i feel about that filmit started well with a good idea a guy edward asner escape from jail dressed as santaa bunch of kids find him and believes his the real santa so the fake santa enlist the children to help him find a bag of stolen moneythe film is like a christmas version of whistle down the wind the movie start well but gradually it becomes cheesier and cheesier to the point that at the end it becomes ridiculous and you just cant take this film seriously for example you get the scrooge type character called sumner rene auberjonois whos a total douchebag who treat his young son like a pile a rubbish he treat his son so bad that he dont even buy him decent clothesthe poor kid wears jeans with holes in it but a 45 second scene with fake santa visiting sumner and by the end of the film you get the guy all happy singing christmas carol and giving his neglected son a hugyep that is how corny it is im all for feel good movie especially during christmas and i am a big fan of seasonal tv movie but this one is way too over the top for meit is a shame because it started well but the second half of the movie is trowing a supernatural element to the film that just dont match with the rest of it its not totally badthere are some solid acting especially from the children but there are plenty of better christmas film around,0
slight spoilers br br way back before evangelion was made before hideaki anno was an idol and household name for many anime fans and before gainax had reached the status of fanfavorite gunbuster was made with only wings of honneamise made by gainax at that time and the famous otakon shorts or course gunbuster had some tough acts to follow up it didnt make it easier on itself by picking out a genre that was already done countless times before space operabr br luckily gainax decided to put it out as a sixpart oav direct to video series this allows the series to have a bigger scope than would have been possible if it was made into a film this also prevents it from becoming too boring and overly long with lots of pointless battles and filler along the way besides that they made some effort to stay clear from the tested space opera mechanics used in macross or gundam and many other popular space operasbr br for one the shows starts out pretty light with noriko in the okinawa high school for mechapiloting noriko is the daughter of a respected ship commander who died in battle when she was still a little kid this makes her life at the academy quite hard as some of her fellow classmates start to suspect that noriko is favored by the professors the first episode is pretty much a comedy drama with a very tight focus on the characters and setting of the school things quickly change when the threat of an alien invasion is announced and noriko and kazumi best girl in class are chosen to help the assembled fleet outbr br the middle bulk of gunbuster leaves our female lead in space focusing on both personal drama and action a couple more characters are introduced and parts of norikos past are dragged up again besides that the alien threat becomes more imminent every minute and the gunbuster mankinds final hope is presented smart as writer okada was he incorporated the principles of time dilation to spice things up a bit in short time moves slower for those who travel at the speed of light this means that noriko can be part of a war that takes almost a century to complete also the dramatic aspect of this is accentuated when noriko sees her friends again on her return to base who have aged considerably more than her the science might not be perfect but its presented in a pretty believable way with even some sd science theatre shorts in between the episodes where noriko kazumi and their coach give a short description of the scientific principles used in the seriesbr br the animation for a series made in the 80s is definitely good the designs are retro 80s style of course but it has its charm animation is fluent enough and the character designs are nice although the costumes do betraybr br some of the fanservice fascination gainax will later exploit to the fullest the mechas throughout the shows are pretty cool too,1
this is the first must see film ive seen in the last year its wickedly funny incredibly original unbelievably great looking they went for this super cool widescreen technicolor look thats awesome to behold and it actually has depth in character and in what it says about society its really smart satire that nails everything from homeland security to race issues while at the same time leaving you laughing and realizing how much are world lives in fear carrie anne moss turns in a comedic performance i never imagined would come from her shes sweet funny and sexy billy connolly is great as fido who can only grunt and moan and dylan baker as the dad is priceless in fact the whole cast is perfect henry czerny as the bad guy tim blake nelson as the neighbor with the hot sexy zombie girlfriend getting the idea now funny thoughprovoking and just all round amazing go and see this movie its like nothing youve ever seen before,1
zentropa has much in common with the third man another noirlike film set among the rubble of postwar europe like ttm there is much inventive camera work there is an innocent american who gets emotionally involved with a woman he doesnt really understand and whose naivety is all the more striking in contrast with the nativesbr br but id have to say that the third man has a more wellcrafted storyline zentropa is a bit disjointed in this respect perhaps this is intentional it is presented as a dreamnightmare and making it too coherent would spoil the effect br br this movie is unrelentingly grimnoir in more than one sense one never sees the sun shine grim but intriguing and frightening,1
i loved this movie im shocked and disappointed that it never made it to the theaters every story was better than the lastmuch better than the much hyped scream series and i know what you did last summerand way better than the terrible urban legend id recommend this film to every horror fan,1
it is rare that one comes across a movie as flawless as this its truly one of the best acted most tightly structured films ive ever seen every line of dialogue can be interpreted in several ways relating to each of the three main characters differently the film weaves an intrinsic web of motivations and double crosses that snare you and refuse to let go add to this that the slowburning romance between kevin and faye is as moving as anything thats ever been committed to celluloid and you have the ingredients for a perfect film it exposes the romance of movies such as titanic as the trite cliches they are if youre looking for a movie to watch while you fold laundry this isnt it you have to commit yourself to this film you cant have a conversation while running in and out of the room this movie demands your attention treat it with the respect you deserve and youll get a lot out of it unless you think titanic is the greatest film ever,1
hmm is it right to compare tiffani thiessen and markpaul gosselaars post saved by the bell acting of course its not right its ridiculous and is right to give this movie a 10 rating hahahahahaha thats funny this movie wasnt so horrible though better than i expected it to be madefortv movies are often so so so similar so many of them have the same feel to them this one had that same feel but it worked even though it was yet another tortured wife whos gotta get the bstard in the end story before it started i had envisioned ms thiessen as a vixen type 90210 seductress but here she was as innocent as kelly kapowski which was refreshing eric close surprised me by playing his part really well with some decent writing the director got a pretty good convincing performance out of him without being at all cheesy all in all it was somewhat interesting definitely better than most tv movies my grade b,1
while the title before the devil knows youre dead comes from an irish proverb the film plays out like a greek tragedy it all starts with a botched robbery and continues to spiral out of control as two brothers attempt to escape the mess theyve gotten themselves intobr br the cast is wellassembled with philip seymour hoffman ethan hawke playing the aforementioned brothers notable support includes albert finney as their father and marisa tomei as the wife of one brother and lover of the other beyond these principals the acting is unremarkablebr br the story is compelling and is told with a certain degree of verve the narrative structure keeps things interesting by providing different points of view and frequent time shifts that being said the films unpredictability is somewhat muted since it becomes apparent early on that this story is a tragedy through and through all in all a pretty impressive debut for firsttime screenwriter kelly mastersonbr br sidney lumets direction is well handled but im more impressed by the fact that hes still directing at over eighty years old i was less impressed by the score by carter burwell but it isnt a major distractionbr br in the end the film proves to be compelling viewing and while the story presentation may have superficial similarities to other films this one remains a unique experience,1
well one has to give the director credit for how gutsy he was gutsy would be the right term not only did he use a total cast of five people no extras at all but he also decided to use subpar special effects with a confusing and boring plot he also and i am not kidding put a warning at the beginning of the movie that you might die of fright however they do promise a freeeeee coooofffffffiiiiinnnnn to have a creepy limping gardener is always a good move yaaauniqueaaawwwwnnnbr br if you watch mystery science theater 3000 you mightve seen this they like to showcase horrible movies just to let you knowbr br a good gift for someone you hate,0
this movie could have been oh so much better it is a beautiful story set in very trying times and yet it was so poorly executed the leading actors have in the past done excellent jobs and for the most part they do an adequate job in this film although at times their dialogue seems stilted and forced the directing could have been more concise the bulk of the criticism should go to the writers who took a good story and made it tedious in short there are thousands of much better ways to spend 2 hours,0
although the flock has some pretty good acting by veteran richard gere and some okay shots that might harken some back to the silence of the lambs days the movie stretches credibility to the breaking point and destroys itself against a plot that really leads nowherebr br the film is about erroll babbage gere who works for the department of safety and is preparing to retire his office thrusts upon him his replacement allison lowry claire danes stardust who quickly discovers that babbage is obsessed with his job and that job aint very fun he monitors hundreds of sexual offenders who are on parole in his jurisdiction allison goes with erroll on many calls to check up on his flock of offenders and learns that he is in desperate need of retirement but erroll is good at his job even if his methods arent he taunts sexual predators and even has physical conflicts with them erroll justifies his actions by bringing up these deviants pasts it is this good justification that challenges the audience on some level letting us see how brutal erroll is and yet how outoftouch hes become by being too close to his jobbr br when a teenage girl goes missing in errolls area he immediate leaps to the conclusion that she was abducted by one of his flock but how could he know is erroll that good at his job allison challenges him and erroll pushes back their battles become as fierce as errolls need to find this missing girlbr br although the setup for the story was okay it didnt have any umpf i will give credit to richard gere however who plays the erroll character very well battling retirement worried about everyone whos near his flock disgusted with those hes responsible for overseeing disgusted with himself for having to do some of things he does quite a change in character portrayal for gere but beyond him theres not much else some of the sets are okay dark and dangerous but there are so many other problems as to be laughablebr br ill be the first to admit that suspending disbelief is a requirement whenever watching films but that suspension has limits the biggest push against those limits is the destruction of extremely vital crime scenes someone as meticulous as erroll would know that moving a body would be a huge nono or trampling through a crime scene or moving evidence it went beyond and hurt the film to no endbr br the other damaging part of this film is that we never get into clair danes character allison shes almost dropped by the wayside at the end of the film and were never privy to what her intension might be will she stay or leave will she end up like erroll if she does stay this isnt a horrible film as it does touch on some uncomfortable moral ground but the story as a whole needed to be tightened up,0
its a mistake to refer to any film of this era as a horror film most early german films with supernatural themes are not so much horror films as they are dark fantasies borrowed from the works of early german romantics like e t a hoffman and others in fritz langs der mude tod also from 1921 death personified takes a young man away from his sweetheart but in langs film the characters destiny cannot be mitigated by behavior neither of the young lovers deserves to die but they are destined by circumstances to be reunited only in deathbr br in victor seastroms korkarlen however repentance is always an option destiny can be altered and death deferred through the characters choices although scenes of the phantom carriage collecting souls are genuinely eerie these horrific images of death as the great leveler are compromised by deaths offer of redemption to the real monster of this tale david holm a brutal drunk who because of a perverse hatred of humanity spreads tuberculosis and emotional misery to everyone he comes in contact withbr br one new years eve holm is struck down in a fight with a drinking companion as the first person to die on the stroke of midnight holm must become the driver of the phantom carriage and collect souls during the new year the phantom carriage driven by an old acquaintance who had started holm on his road to ruin comes for his soul and takes him on a journey of self discovery along the way holm sees the horror he has inflicted on his family and the people who tried to help himbr br perhaps my disappointment with the films ending is a criticism of the selma lagerlöf novel on which the film is based but i would have preferred to see david holm unable to escape his destiny and to see his repentance come too late to prevent his wife from poisoning his two children and herself and to see holm suffer for the consequences of his sins by being made to collect their souls it would have been a fitting punishment and a horror more immense than witnessing the abuse he inflicted on others in the film however the unalterable nature of destiny isnt the message redemption is the driver of the carriage allows holms spirit to return to his body and he rescues his family in the nick of time his repentance smacks of scrooges repentance in a christmas carol br br if the trite and sentimental ending does not offend you there is still much to admire in the films images the special effects are astonishing when measured by the standards of the day and still hold up which is more miraculous when you consider that these double exposures were created inside a handcranked camera also the restored film on tartans new dvd looks fabulous,1
this must be one of the worst movies ive ever seen the graphics are ridiculous and the script pathetic and the biggest question is how this rather low brow script got trough the selection processbr br i like all sorts of movies from deep dramas to the more male oriented kill everything you see type of movie so i cant say im picky i have been struggling to find something to compare it to but i just cant think of anything that matches this maybe starship troopers 2 witch in my opinion makes the movie gods cry and me thinking about throwing out my dvd player but compared to this its effects are great the acting superb and the script should be awarded you know when a movie is bad in a funny way well folks this isnt one of those this kills your soul minute by minute,0
i attended a screening of this film travolta came to do a q a after the film ended it was a small screening room in tribeca out of courtesy to him i did not walk out which i wanted to do this is filmmaking at its worst to start the script was poorly written the writer writes in one voice the dialogue was stilted and clichéd how this writerdirector got scarlet johansen john travolta and lions gate entertainment to back her on this is the only brilliant thing she accomplished in this fiascobr br i do in fact recommend this film to all aspiring screenwriters directors and filmmakers because when you are told that you are wasting your time and it will be impossible for you to reach your goals heyjust look at this crap and say to yourselfif they can make this then anythings poosiblebr br ps travolta did a great qa thoughhe was at ease spoke freely and was a down to earth nice guy the directorwriter stood on the sidelines when john tried to engage her in the conversation she stood back like a piece of wood and never joined in i looked at her and i thoughthow was this person able to successfully pitch to agents studio execs top talent when she cant open her mouth at a screening of her own film the conclusion from a few of us in attendance was that she must have strong family connections in the businessbr br after you watch this you should follow it with guy ritchies zero star masterpiece swept away with the most unintentionally funny and worst performance by wife madonna shes so bad and looks so bad in this film i figure this was her his way of getting back at her for all the abuse he takes from her at home,0

this may sound crazy to even the people who remember this showbut i remembered this as being liveaction i dont think i ever saw the cartoon but movie maybe i remember it very clearly the guy was in a building kinda like a showroom he even had the red jacket it was dark out and he turned into a red car and there was this guy on the second level looking down at him the carguy spun around and crashed through the big showroom type window and out onto the street and then proceeded to drive off that is all i remember i really hope someone else out there remembers this too if not maybe im still crazy but im hoping im not,0
this is by far the worst film i have seen in my entire life the acting is poor and the storyline is almost incomprehensible whether or not you like lightships or any ships for that matter is irrelevant as for special effects the film has none the whole film crew were probably on the boat out in rough seas rather than in a studio and when some of the men are stabbed if you can even call it that their reactions are totally unreal the guns are more quiet than a mute how this film could have one two awards puts serious questions to the state of the human mind well thats about it this review is probably more fun to read than the film is to watch if anyone is considering watching it or buying it i would seriously advise you against it for obvious reasons i have said that it includes a spoiler if the fact that some people get stabbed and a gun gets fired is a plot giveaway i suppose it is because they are the only good parts of the film,0
i went to see this film based on the review by siskel and ebert not only did i get duped but i took some friends along and had to spend the rest of the day profusely apologizing for making them sit through this pointless crap after this i never went to see a movie based solely on siskel eberts advice,0
this movie was a major disappointment on direction intellectual niveau plot and in the way it dealt with its subject painting it is a slow moving film set like an episode of wonder years with appalling lack of depth though it also fails to deliver its message in a convincing mannerbr br the approach to the subject of painting is very elite limited to vague and subjective terms as beauty according to the makers of this movie beauty can be only experienced in bobrossstyle kitschy landscape paintings good art according to this film can be achieved by applying basic like primary school level color theory and lots of sentiment in parts the movie is offending eg at a point it is stated rather celebrated by dancing on tables that mentally handicapped people are not capable of having emotions or expressing them through painting their works by definition being worthless bullshit quotebr br i do not understand how the movie could get such high rating then again so far not many people rated it and they chose for only very high or very low grades,0
what a wasted opportunity to actually make an interesting film about a complicated subject there is very little exploration about what it really feels like to be a straight or gay man working in a gay sexual environmentthe dancers keep talking about their art as if it has no erotic component they may not all be prostitutes for hire but they are indeed sex workers playing out fantasies and selling private sessions where more than dancing is offered from the film one would get the impression that they mainly appeal to the women who go to the gay clubs and then end up hiring the dancers for private sessions even the shots in the club only show women in front of the stage and the dancers only playing to the women in the audience this just isnt the reality of these clubs it would be pretty hard to make a living doing private dances for straight women and couples so what do they really feel about their gay admirers and clients we learn very little instead we get filler a gay activist who adds nothing to the study of straight dancers a manager who tells us about the costumes for the drag acts but offers no insight into the dancers lives and attitudesbr br the pictures of mexico city are generic the phallic montage showing sausages roasting is ridiculousbr br this is a totally simplistic film which should be of interest only to those who want to see a few pictures of pretty boys dancing the rest of the movie is an insult to gay men,0
this is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time all of you who regard this movie as absolute sht obviusly are not intelligent enough to grasp all of the subtle humor that this movie has to offer it shows us that real life and ficticious action can produce a winning combination also as a romantic comedy it has one of the most clever ways for two people to find each other name me another movie where you can see all of that as well as donald sutherland singing a song like theyre going to find your anus on a mountain on mars,1
i think my summary sums it up i found it inane and stupid i also saw the ending a mile a way everyone is copying that ending anymore when doing a tvtheater crossover anymore sometimes its better to let the movie stand alonebr br others its better to forget the movie altogether this is one of the others,0
doyle had never wanted to resurrect holmes from his joint death with professor moriarty in the adventure of the final problem howeverfinancial considerations made him willing in 1901 to write the hound of the baskervilles which is still considered his best holmes novel and possibly his best novel but it was a memoir of the great detective written before his death only a greater outcry from his public led doyle to fully resurrect holmes in the adventure of the empty house published in 1905br br it is not that the new short stories and the last novel are really bad maybe three of the stories are really terrible but even the terrible ones are very readable several of the later ones like the adventure of the solitary cyclist are really very good but the unevenness of production in particularly after the stories in his last bow 1917 become increasingly apparent he repeats past story lines and he shows really negative aspects of holmes in the story the adventure of the three gables holmes shows a sneering sarcasm at a character who is of african ancestry br br spoiler coming upbr br the adventure of charles augustus milverton deals with holmes trying to recover compromising letters from milverton a hugely successful blackmailer it is an interesting example of how doyle could make a highly readable story with a minimum of plot for there is little real detective work in the tale holmes is hired to try to negotiate with milverton regarding the purchase of the letters but to get them back no matter what milverton proves not only unwilling to consider a smaller amount for the papers but prepared to protect himself from holmes attempting a search of his person later we learn holmes has gotten into the household of milverton by romancing a maid while disguised at the end holmes goes with watson to burglarize milvertons home he and watson are in the house when they find that milverton is awaiting some new business deal in his study someone with information that milverton can use carefully hiding holmes and watson watch as a woman comes in who turns out to be a victim of collateral damage from milvertons past activities and who shoots the blackmailer to death holmes and watson are able to set fire to milvertons collection of compromising documents before fleeing the house and subsequently discover for themselves the identity of the woman the police under lestrade dont discover who the two mysterious men seen running from milvertons home are and they are so disgusted by milvertons activities they never were able to bring anything home against him that it is obvious the murder will never be solvedbr br the tale is not one of the fascinating ones with real detective work involved like the adventure of the speckled band or silver blaze it is a tale of mood and late action the issue being will holmes and watson get the papers or will they be caught by milverton it is not one of the best stories but it is,1
this is an excellent standup dvd eddie izzard is the funniest person i have seen in years his routine is hilarious and makes for great conversation with others who have seen it i highly recommend this one the part about the history of europe is a bit slow but the ending jokes in french are quite good because you dont have to speak french to get it although if you do it is still hilarious also the parts about being a transvestite are quite good the first scene about san francisco is not great but funny the first time skip over those if you can its almost not worth watching however this really is a funny funny standup show that everyone should see i was dead at the time,1
its partly bad luck for illuminata that it comes out after shakespeare in love as it deals with virtually the same themes of life as art art as life and the magic of the theatre and the same archetypal foibles of theater folk but a whole lot more ponderouslybr br there are scenes that come alive as a play develops and gets reinterpreted by a writers life but theres a whole lot of orson wellesish ego in this produced bydirected bylead acted by john torturro as a vehicle for his wife katharine borowitz with an adorable cameo by their sonbr br each actor gets hisher moment literally in the spotlight but theres so many masques or set pieces that seem like 19th century parlor games bill irwin talks susan sarandon gets to be a diva christopher walken gets to be a different kind of villain a gay critic the women have to disrobe unnecessarily because this is an art filmbr br the art and set direction are marvelous though quite dark this should get an award as the best use of a jersey city theater as a set ever in a movie originally written 82199,0
maybe one of the most entertaining ninjamovies ever made a hardhitting action movie with lots of gore and slow motion eehaaa made in 83 and still the greatest swedish action movie made so far and we can hardly wait to see the upcoming sequel ninja mission 2000 the legacy of markov,1
soderbergh is a fabulous director but nothing he could conjure could beat the amazing cast he gathered for this zenith of sequels clearly he knew this from the getgo the term starvehicle has traditionally been used to refer to a movie that builds itself around one star what this film does is net a whole herd of hollywood hot shots and make them shine even brighter than before the last scene says it allall the stars sitting around with nothing happening and nothing being said we just get to see them socialize as though it were a scene from a reality show where george clooney catherine zetajones matt damon brad pitt and don cheadle are just hanging out being themselves so the storys not important at allat least thats not where the films greatest pleasures come from if you want a clever heist movie better stick with 11 but if stargazing turns you on this will make your day,1
on sunday july 27 1997 the first episode of a new science fiction series called stargate sg1 was broadcast on showtime a spinoff of and sequel to the 1994 film stargate starring kurt russell and james spader the series begins approximately one year after the events portrayed in the film for ten seasons it chronicled the adventures and misadventures of an intrepid team of explorers known as sg1 originally the series starred richard dean anderson as colonel jack oneill two ls michael shanks as dr daniel jackson amanda tapping as captain samantha carter christopher judge as tealc and don s davis as major general george s hammond for ten long years we watched the team battle against the goauld the replicators the ori and many other aggressors at the same time they forged alliances with the asgard the tokra the rebel jaffa the nox and the tollan they saved the world no less than eight times over the years and never gave up not until death claimed them and sometimes not even thenbr br as with all longrunning series they were numerous cast changes michael shanks left the series in january 2002 at the end of its fifth season in order to broaden his horizons as an actor daniel jacksons successor as the teams resident archaeologistgeek was jonas quinn an alien from a country called kelowna on the planet langara played by corin nemec however shanks returned at the beginning of the seventh season in june 2003 and nemec left at the same time unfortunately he made only one further guest appearance and his character was seldom mentioned afterwards don s davis left the series at the end of the seventh season in march 2004 as he felt that it was time for him to go the shows original star and arguably its most popular actor richard dean anderson starred in the series throughout its first eight seasons his participation in the seventh and eight seasons was noticeably less than in the earlier seasons he finally left sg1 in march 2005 in order to spend more time with his then sixyearold daughter jack oneill was by far my favourite character in the series and truth be told i never enjoyed the last two seasons as much as i did the earlier episodes for that very reasonbr br the ninth season represented a new era for the programme with the departure of its lead actor and the defeat of the goauld and the replicators in season eight many fans felt the series should go out on a high regardless the series carried on for a further two years with the ori replacing the goauld as the series main adversaries three new characters were brought in to fill the gaps as it were and help usher in this reinvention ben browder came in as the cocky southern air force pilot lt colonel cameron mitchell the new leader of sg1 his farscape costar the lovely claudia black began to play a prominent role in the series as the vivacious sexy hilarious and certainly extroverted vala,1

le grand voyage is a gentle miracle of a film a work made more profound because of its understated script by writerdirector ismaël ferroukhi who allows the natural scenery of this road trip story and the sophisticated acting of the stars nicolas cazalé and mohamed majd to carry the emotional impact of the film ferroukhis vision is very capably enhanced by the cinematography of katell djian a sensitive mixture of travelogue vistas of horizons and tightly photographed duets between characters and the musical score by fowzi guerdjou who manages to maintain some beautiful themes throughout the film while paying homage to the many local musical variations from the numerous countries the film surveys br br reda nicolas cazalé lives with his muslim family in southern france a young student with a western girlfriend who does not seem to be following the religious direction of his heritage his elderly father mohamed majd has decided his time has come to make his hadj to mecca and being unable to drive requests the reluctant reda to forsake his personal needs to drive him to his ultimate religious obligation the two set out in a fragile automobile to travel through france into italy and on through bulgaria croatia slovenia and turkey to saudi arabia along the trip reda pleads with his father to visit some of the interesting sights but his father remains focused on the purpose of the journey and reda is irritably left to struggle with his fathers demands on their pilgrimage they encounter an old woman ghina ognianova who attaches herself to the two men and must eventually be deserted by reda a turkish man mustapha jacky nercessian who promises to guide the fatherson duo but instead brings about a schism by getting reda drunk in a bar and disappearing and countless border patrol guards and custom agents who delay their progress for various reasons tensions between father and son mount reda cannot understand the importance of this pilgrimage so fraught with trials and mishaps and the father cannot comprehend redas insensitivity to the fathers religious beliefs and needs at last they reach mecca where they are surrounded by hoards of pilgrims from all around the world and the sensation of trips significance is overwhelming to reda the manner in which the story comes to a close is touching and rich with meaning it has taken a religious pilgrimage to restore the gap between youth and old age between son and father and between defiance and acceptance of religious values br br the visual impact of this film is extraordinary all the more so because it feels as though the camera just happens to catch the beauty of the many stopping points along the way without the need to enhance them with special effects nicolas cazalé is a superb actor be sure to see his most recent and currently showing film the grocers son and it is his carefully nuanced role that brings the magic to this film another fine film from the film movement this is a tender story brilliantly told highly,1
when all we have anymore is pretty much reality tv shows with people making fools of themselves for whatever reason be it too fat or cant sing or cook worth a damn than i know hollywood has run out of original ideas i can not recall a time when anything original or intelligent came out on tv in the last 15 years what is our obsession with watching bums make fools of themselves i would have thought these types of programs would have run full circle but every year they come up with something new that is more strange then the one before ok so people in this one need to lose weightmost americans need to lose weight i just think we all to some degree enjoy watching people humiliated maybe it makes us feel better when we see someone else looking like a jerk i dont know but i just wish something intelligent would come out that did not insult your intelligence,0
any chance to see katharine hepburn in something i havent seen or from her early movie career is a treat and on that level the film is amusing but shes horrible miscast as a hill billy her famous new england enunciation slips through making lines like id better rustle up some vittles pretty ludicrous shes so pretty and so young it almost overcomes this major flaw the story is an old fashioned melodrama and there fore a younger generation may think this pretty corny stuff but this was the staple of american entertainment well into the 1940s it has its moments but you might need to be a diehard movie buff to appreciate it,0
we arrived at the theater too late to see rendition which was our intention and the comebacks was the only film that hadnt already started i had an inkling of how bad a film it was after reading the short blurb at the ticket counter the theater was empty when we arrived and only two other people entered before the film startedbr br the screenwriters and director threw every imaginable sports cliché at the audience without creating a single laugh not one during the entire movie think of all the football movies that have been made and the millions of dollars schools and fans spend each year on football and you realize how ripe it is to be parodied or lampooned if you add texas to the mixyou ought to come up with the sports version of little miss sunshine not a big yawnbr br the first film that came to mind as we exited the theater was cant stop the music by comparison this was cant stop the music without bruce jenner valerie perrine or the village peoplebr br if the film had a single grace note it was seeing matthew lawrence grown up,0
the movie and acting are not bad and jay hernandez does a good job playing calito brigante but the movie forgets its suppose to be a prequel to a hit movie the makers of this prequel clearly did not watch the original carlitos way or at least did not care about continuity this movie is a prequel which means the original movie has already laid out some history for us and this movie should end where the original begins or at least lead up to it not one of carlitos close old friends from the original make an appearance in this movie theyre not even mentioned luis guzman pachanga in the original is in the movie but he plays a completely different character the original takes place in 1975 and the prequel takes place in 196970 considering this movie takes place less than 5 years earlier wouldnt you think one of carlitos long time friends would make an appearance in the original carlito starts out being released from jail after spending 5 years in jail thats only a few months between the end of the prequel and the start of the original semi spoiler we know from the beginning of the original carlito has spent 5 years in prison so when the prequel gives us this hollywood happy ending its an insult to the intelligence of fans of the original what happen to gail its the lack of continuity that made this film go direct to video release,0
well ive enjoy this movie even though sometimes it turns too much to a stereotypical situation i didnt understood at this time if the punishment park has exist in the past but i think the matter isnt really herebr br you have to look at this movie in a different manner it shows how much violence you can find in our world it reminds us that we live in a world who is lead by violence and that nobody can escape from it if anyone refuse to take his responsabilities then you will be thrown out of our societyall our history is made by wars we should never forget this in fact its only when we will finally accept the truth that maybe we will change and understand that our intellectual skills have improve so we could use them to find others ways to resolve our problemsbr br in 2 words this movie is a must see maybe it will help us to accept the truth,1

not sure if this is just a lousy movie or if it was intended to be a mockery of a b western story line was soso but the filming editing and acting were just plain bad plus the music in the background was irritating to no end too loud and just nonstop many times you could not make out the dialog over the background music im in sass single action shooting society and do some old west shooting with them and a lot of the actors are members of this group so thats why i bought it if you have no interest in this group of people or that sport you certainly most likely wouldnt even have this little bit of interest to help out with the film the acting of even the veteran actors particularly stella stevens left a lot to be desired also,0
i kept waiting for the film to move me inspire me shock me sadden me in some way but it stirred none of my emotions it just meandered along to the end none of the characters seemed very unique or complex they just seemed like actors reciting their lines i think it could have been a better movie if the characters expressed more emotion the only one who did and was believable was the veteran and he probably committed suicide just to get out of the movie as soon as he could it was a waste of talent film their time and mine if there is a message or meaning or genius in this story it certainly is wellhidden or i am very dense which i doubt,0
as long as you go into this movie knowing that its terrible bad acting bad effects bad story bad everything then youll love it this is one of my favorite goof on movies watch it as a comedy and have a dozen good laughs,1
this film is too good for words its so unbelievably great and funny and true to life you just know from watching this that the person who wrote this has defiantly felt the way that jip and his friends do through the film it was my life at one point and i would rely on coming home to watch human traffic ever night before i could even think of going to bed i think you just get so loved up with the characters and their life style of course this film wouldnt be for old people more around the age of 16 to 22 i guess there is defiantly nothing wrong with this film and it will have you in stitches all the way through it doesnt have a particular story line to it the general idea is a weekend in the life of older teens in london and what they get up to the places they go the people they meet the drugs they take and the experiences they have you have to get this movie on dvd never mind just watching it you have to have it,1
all of david priors movies are terrible on all counts bad writing bad acting bad cinematography no budget the directors brother is usually cast as the male lead but they all have incredible entertainment value because of their unintentional hilarity the plot of almost every david prior film as i like to refer to them is basically the same manly allamerican commandos team up to blow up communist baddies but unlike other cold warera garbage such as red dawn priors movies are actually funny because of their overthetop premises and acting the best part of jungle assault is the scene in which becker or was is the other dude is being summoned by general mitchell for a topsecret mission in south america the funniest line in the movie is then delivered something to the effect of this is my roommate i trained him well what you trained your roommate and apparently this is going to be their solution to avoiding evictionbr br if you can find these gems on video used anywhere buy them they are all funny and even funnier after a few beers watch them with a group of your friends for a true mst3kstyle experience so far my friends and i have managed to get a hold of night wars and aerobicide aka killer workout but the one i recommend the most over them all is final sanction with the freakishlooking robert zdar,0
this is a strong recommendation to anyone who reads this review who has never seen the film total reality dont waste your time and money renting this poor excuse for a film this is without peer the single worst movie that i have ever seen in my life i had nightmares of this movie ever since i saw it the acting was terrible and any amateur film maker could make a more decent film the film blatently rips off far superior scifi films such as timecop or total recall where the title seems to have been derived from im sorry but i just think that there is more entertainment value in watching the side of a cardboard box for two hours if you already have seen this movie i feel sorry for you for going through what i did,0
not one of your harderhitting stories and thats a real strength of this film there are at least two relationships in which less confident writers would have added some alltoo predictable romantic tension they not only spare the audience this but throw in some surprises at the same time there are a few disneyish moments particularly near the end but they are manageable overall it was worth the rental and it was good relaxed funbr br btw if you get the dvd watch the segment where the director teaches you how to make aloo gobi we followed her directions and it was brilliant next time we will make it the day before we plan to eat it because this is one dish that definitely gets better with a full night in the fridge to let the spices out,1
zen and the art of lanscaping written and directed by david kartch is a short film about a young man named david his friends call him zen and what transpires in one strange day of his life zen works as a lanscaper for an uppermiddle class family the lady of the house tries to get zen to help her cheat on her husband unfortunately her son walks in on them instead of her husband from this point on the movie starts to speed through many revelations between the characters along with the eventual involvement of the man of the house zen and the art of landscaping is witty smart and overall very well written the comedic timing of the actors is also very strong its a fun light movie that i would strongly recommend,1
spoilers with a gathering of family members and servants of the late christopher dean john carradine to hear his last will and testament they get somewhat of a surprise in that the dean fortune some 140 million dollars the money is to be divided between them but only after they successfully spend a week at the dean mansion there seemed to have been a mixup in the story when we later find out that its really an overnight sleepover not a weeks vacation at the mansion for the guests to qualify for deans money since almost everyone ends up dead by sunrisebr br the first victim of the dean curse have nothing at all to do with getting and money from the departed christopher dean estate the local sheriff dan garcia rodolfo acosta acosta has his head chopped off refrigerated and then served on a platter to a shocked group of guests later that evening cute little chin greg and laurasjeff morrow marry anderslittle pet pooch is found dead outside floating in the pondbr br the movie has all the people staying at the dean mansion being picked off one by one until its revealed who the killer really is we then have what seems to be a doubletwist in the story where the original killer is suddenly killed together with two of the last remaining guest the real killer ends up not only getting all the loot 140 million dollars but then ends up not having to split it with his accomplice by doing him or her in by giving him a poisonous cookie that kills him on the spotbr br nonsensical who done it and haunted house movie with a cast of such immoral and unlikable characters that even a mother much less the audience would have trouble liking theres everything you can possibly think of in the move involving the selective guests that includes incest sm sadism and of course doubledealing and backstabbing not even counting murder you just couldnt care less who of the guests survives to collect the dean fortune at the end of the movie hoping against all hope then none of them dobr br even the big surprise at the end isnt really that much of a surprise since the killers identity is divulged with the filmmaker having forgotten to keep his face in the shadows so you actual see who he is even before he reveals himself we then have a plottwist that eliminates the killer together with a number of remaining guest just to make the movie a little more confusing then it already is the final plottwist that you can see coming from as far as ten miles away was just to show how smart the very obvious killer was which fooled almost nobody watching the movie,0
while i had wanted to se this film since the first time i watched the trailer i was in for a deep surprise with this film while some of the elements and actions of the characters seemed a little too cartoonish the dark nature of the film really makes this a much different experience instead of the feelgoodhappystory this film takes you in another direction that proves to be uplifting but also disturbing most kids wont understand some of the darker moments in the film which makes this film rather watchable for adults i was also impressed with the cinematography using animation and digital animation to create a seamless network of pans and tilts the musical score was once again solid proving hans zimmer is the goto guy when it comes to animated scores and i never thought i would say i actually enjoyed brian adams music,1
rutger hauer helps along a film that basically can be summed up in the young person finding themselves category and rather obviously so so it needs a lot of helpbr br the beginning holds a lot more promise of a film that could turn into michael clayton or stranger than fiction its too bad because i really got hooked into the beginning then like the opening soundtrack it went from great and intriguing to basically nowherebr br its fun enough with plenty of curiosities and interesting characters acted well im sure that will be enough for many people the problem is it all feels contrived and empty which ironically is supposed to be the main discovery for the characters self realization not the film itself its not a self aware film but that the character is supposed to recognize his own life is contrived and empty,0
all the right elements seemed to conspire here to make this a memorable thriller for years to come you have the stellar cast michael douglas in an uncharacteristic freespirit role that pretty much launched his movie career fonda playing her typical forthright female doing her bit for womens lib and jack lemmon as assured as ever showing us a man with a crisis of confidence give them a hotbutton topic about big business being duplicitous and thats encouraging for a kickoff but to have life imitating art so soon after is a marketing mans dreambr br the script is impressively taut intelligent but mercifully keeping the jargon to a minimum and there is a genuine sense of sustained tension brought in play by the director as our three protagonists race to beat the clock if you like whistle blowing dramas then this is not quite as good as the insider but the whole thing is more than nervy enough,1

emotionally insecure tom russo asbestos felt reads the secret diary of his sexy wife leeza courtney lercara and is dismayed to discover that the love of his life has apparently been sleeping with every bloke she meets this shocking revelation sends poor tom off his rocker and he proceeds to wreak bloody revenge on the men who he believes have been rogering his old ladybr br in my experience really really bad films can often be as much fun as really good ones and no film featuring a decapitation by macheteenhanced ceiling fan should ever be considered completely worthless but even though killing spree very occasionally manages to entertain with its inventiveness and cheap and cheerful gore i found that the terrible direction awful production values ugly cinematography muffled sound dreadful lighting mind numbingly tedious and daft narrative which includes a really dumb plot twist that is telegraphed from the beginning plus a pointless zombie finale nasty synthesizer score inane dialogue and thoroughly amateurish acting all served to make this effort from writerdirector tom ritter a virtually joyless experience,0

love is hard to find in this fast food society that we live in so man called hitch makes it duty to help men find love with women that they are beyond madly in love with his rules are that he only helps you find love and not just some casual sex which seems like a great deal but soon word begins to spread around and people begin to get the wrong idea about what he does which begins to complicate the relationship with woman he just met that he is madly in love withbr br i have to say its really nice to see will smith in a movie that doesnt have him trying to save the world from aliens or robots there are no jaw dropping effects nor is he showing off his beefed up body hes just a normal human being in this movie which was really nice he doesnt necessarily stretch his acting muscles in this movie but then again the story doesnt call for that but all the same it was nice to see him relaxed and not showing off his ripped body to make those of us without six packs jealous his character here is as with all his characters likable witty and very charming which is something that almost all the characters in this odd love tale seem to share the kevin james character is just a regular guy that needs help hooking up with the girl of his dreams which really makes you feel for the guy and root for him every step of the way the only character that was a sore spot for me was the mendez character because shes so cold and calculated that its hard to believe that smith could fall for her he must love a challenge i guessbr br now this is the part of the review in which ill make a joke about how i would never need hitch because im such a player but i just got through writing about 16 reviews for another web site plus im still working on a little project so im a little jaded right now whiles the movie is packed with enough charm and likable characters with funny lines it slowly but surely falls into the sea of formulaic romantic movies in which after the big scene where the terrible secret comes out everyone is forgiven and the relationship is even better than before but hey theres like 4000 movies about the underdog overcoming adversity so i guess one more movie having a predictable ending thats been done to almost death doesnt cause much harm i really like the message of the movie as well because in the end you dont need a formula to get the right girl just be yourself and all will fall into play which is theme of the movie and why it works so well im sure if it had turned out that the james character gets the girl after following everything that the smith character said then it would have being a pretty empty,1
it didnt feel like a movie and was thankfully short under 90minutes it felt more like a commercial of possibilties in computer graphics most of the special effects are great to be sure but that cerainly dont a great or even a good movie make not saying its absolutely worthless viewing since its possible to see what are the possibilities in cgi or gci or what ever its calledbr br as i read somewhere you cant fix it in the cutting room a bad story and nondirected actors cant be fixed in the cutting room or even with the most magnificent special effects things can be improved in the cutting room if they have a real director and material to work frombr br however they thought this could be sold in usa is anyones idea since usa is the crooksbr br and isnt it sooo typical of low budget stories they have to create an imaginative country south of mexicobr br well well i gace it 2 just because of the special effects the rest is absolute trash,0
i remember being forced yesliterally forced to see this film by a southern baptist preacher when i was a kid and even then i loved its awfulness its designed to scare poor suckers into being saved the only thing that saved me was the fact that it finally ended and i could go out and have a real lifebr br check out the chapter on this film in sarah diamonds book the politics of the christian right fascinating and certainly more interesting than the movie,0
according to imdb takashi miikes master of horrorsegment imprint was banned in the us so i figured id translate the swedish review i just wrote for itbr br it was hard to not have any sort of expectations from ichi the killerdirector takashi miikes episode in the masters of horror series and the dvdcover of imprint did in deed look very promisingbr br the story mostly takes place in a remote japanese bordello some time during the 19th century and it tells the tale of a journalist searching for komomo the woman he left behind and whom he promised to return for tired and dejected he arrives at the bordello hoping that this will be the end of his very long journey it turns out that one of the prostitutes a deformed and quiet girl know about komomo and the desperate man makes her tell him where she is and what has happened to her since he left the story she tells him is as deplorable as it is hard to swallowbr br the first thing that hit me about the episode was how unnatural it seemed that the japanese cast for the most part spoke fluent americanenglish but i will leave it at that its not that big a deal what is a big deal however is how miserable the rest of it was miikes tale moves at such a slow pace that i couldnt help looking at my watch several times during the 63 minutes the extended torurescene that takes place somewhere in the middle of the movie felt so unmotivated and pornographically intrusive that not even that scene became interesting i felt like it was violent just for the sake of violence itself with no sense of style or purpose the only scenes that provoked any kind of emotion out of me were the images of bloody fetuses rolling along the bottom of the swiftly flowing waterand in all honesty the only emotions they provoked were feelings of disgustbr br the journalist seeking the love he left behind is played by billy drago for me most memorable as frank nitti al capones whiteclad assassin in brian de palmas the untouchables 1987 ive always found dragos portrayal of nitti to be very icy and i mean that in a good way and that is probably why i was almost annoyed when i found him to be so terrible not in a good way in this one his acting seems to flow between no feelings or empathy whatsoever to displays of some really bad overacting when his character is supposed to react to the awful things komomo has been subjected to i was sitting in the sofa twisting and turning in an attempt to escape the horrible actingjob put forth by drago im grateful that most of the story is told by yuoki kudoh memoirs of a geisha 2005 who plays the deformed prostitutebr br the finale is probably supposed to be chocking maybe even revolting and horrid but i just found it to be kind ofyou know blah and i,0
billed as a kind of sequel to the full monty about unemployed men in sheffield this movie is a fakebr br as someone born in sheffield and still with links to the city i was extremely disappointed by this film someone said it could have been set in oklahoma and that just about sums it up for me this looked like a romantic view of northern england made for the us market probably many americans and many southern english people dont realize that sheffield is a big city of around half a million inhabitants with a sophisticated urban culture in among giants it was depicted as some dreary deadend semirural small town where everyone in sheffield seemed to drink in the same oldfashioned pub and where the peoples idea of a party was linedancing in some villagehall lookalike this was a small closeknit community not a metropolitan citybr br the workingclass sheffield men were totally unlike their reallife counterparts who are generally taciturn and communicate with each other in grunts and brief dry remarks they dont chatter and they certainly dont sing in choirsbr br even the rural settings supposedly in the peak district looked alien to me i recognized a few places where i used to go hiking but some of the aerial shots of pylons stretching out over a bleak landscape reminded me more of wales indeed in the credits at the end i spotted a reference to gwynedd wales the peak district is in the summer crawling with walkers and tourists in cars it is situated between two big cities it is not some kind of wildernessbr br as for the notion that a young woman could fall in love with and lust after pete postlethwaite that was ludicrous and could only have been a male dream her reasons for becoming his lover were never made apparent none of the men was shown as having a partner or families they existed in a vacuumbr br anyone wanting to see a film about unemployed sheffielders would have been led astray this sheffield existed only in the minds of its middleclass writers and filmmakersbr br it was a gigantic fakebr br,0
i came across this movie on dvd purely by chance through a blockbuster rental voyage to the planets is an excellent bbc 2hour documentarydrama about a future grand tour of the solar system taking pains to adhere to current knowledge about the planets and space flight and plausible extropolations from existing technology this movie tells the story of astronauts on a journey to venus mars jupiter saturn and plutobr br the special effects are excellent for a tv show i found the actors believable as astronauts the situations presented are for the most part plausible and you learn a lot about the science of the planets and spaceflight only two minor complaints i found some of the situations and dialogue somewhat maudlin at times furthermore i am unsure that a single crew and ship would be sent on a single mission to see all those destinations at once time more than likely visits to venus mars jupiter etc wouldwill be separate missionsbr br they didnt try to skimp on this show with production values the scenes of venus and mars were actually filmed in the northern deserts of chilethe driest area on earth and a deadringer for the martian landscape weightlessness sequences were filmed in a diving russian transport jet the producers could have fudged on either of these using studios and cgi but chose the real thing insteadbr br i would like to especially mention the marvelous music that was composed for this movie don daviss thrilling theme is the first thing that grabs you when the movie starts as the magnificent shot of the pegasus passes the screen and david suchet intones it is the destiny of man to explore the starsbr br watching this on a small television screen is one regret i have what a thrill to see this in a movie theatre or even better an imax presentation,1
one of the those coming of age films that should have nostalgia for adults and promise for the kids this movie has neither it is a poor excuse to let sylvia kristels body double frolic with a dorky eric brown to make matters worse the movie is either silly or stupid when it tries to be funny sexy or dramatic laugh awkwardly as we are supposed to believe that a teenager would go alone with burying a dead woman in his front yard ponder vigorously on why a woman famous for emmanuelle needs a body double as the movie went on and on i started to imagine a hybrid of private lessons and little miss millions that had sylvia kristel seduce jennifer love hewitt as howard hesseman makes us nostalgic for wkrp watch this to laugh at other peoples stupidity or for ed begley jrs committed performance or to wonder what sylvia kristel would look like with jennifer love hewitt but i can give you an idea of your lesson stay away from movies staring sylvia kristel that are not emmanuelle,0
this is my first awful rating ever on imdb and i couldnt think of a more deserving film to honor it with i hoped for entertaining trash and found trash of the saddest dullest kind i found a film which no one can possibly have cared a bit about including its creatorbr br hell ride directed written by and starring larry friend of qt bishop has a simple plot about a hidden treasure and a trio of keys two bands of bikers and a gruesome murder in 1976 which has yet to be avenged larry seems fiercely determined not to tell this story focusing instead of putting his swaying strangely grimacing main character into situations where he can fondle women who pretend to like it he also has a dialog containing enough horrible fire punsmetaphors to put one off the word fire for lifebr br dennis hopper escapes complete humiliation others are not so lucky sometimes they hit the road on their bikes making one feel even more sorry for michael madsen since his high handles seems to add insult to the injury of having to appear in this film there is plenty of siliconenhanced nudity but fairly little action and no humor whatsoever making one wonder just what kind of an audience they had in mindbr br my guess is that most people who watch this film including fans of trashy 60s biker movies will feel cheated do yourself a favor and revisit the real stuff instead,0

stephen king movies are a funny thing with me i either really love them or i loathe them some of the fancier productions such as desperation and storm of the century i didnt enjoy some of the smaller ones i really loved sleepwalkers is one that i really do enjoy and watch it regularlybr br the story revolves around charles brady and his mother mary they are sleepwalkers shape shifting creatures who although human like in appearance shift into a feline like creature they are immune to the scratch of cats and whenever they move to a new town lay out traps to catch and kill the animals when they move to their latest town they need to seek out a virgin and when charles finds one he actually falls for herbut his mother needs to feed from her to keep up her strength the story revolves around what will happen with the girl will charles spare her or use her to save his motherbr br although this story has overtones of incest which some may find unappealing it does actually play a part in the story and is therefore not just plonked in the movie for scandals sake like most stephen king stories its based in a small town with lots of interesting characters the acting isnt the best nor are the special effects however somehow the whole thing tends to gel and is very watchable and enjoyable adaptionbr br for uk readers this production has most recently been shown on bbc1 scifi and sky thrillerhorror channels,1

surely no saturday morning tv kids show was ever done this poorly after all those producers had to count on the audience coming back well in this awful offering they could at least count the money they saved on sets the script could have been a reject from some longforgotten space opera serial with a few smarmy lines added for cooldude gerald mohr to murmur to naura hayden no director could have done anything decent with such a loony storyline so the action just plods boringly along the spaceship props are absurda bulova wall clock and portable typewriter for examplebut the planet sets have got to be some of the worst in cinematic history most are crude drawings and its all bathed in an often misfocused red light even mohrs bare hairy chest is used as a prop and its a bad oneas ribthin as the plot any viewer who can make it to the end of this movie will hear a message from the martiansand will probably agree completely,0
although the video box for many copies of this film claims it is about people turned inside out this is a total lie in fact apart from the opening segment the film isnt even a horror movie with its sunken treasure legions of fish people and mad scientists its a lot more like a doug mcclure adventure movie obviously this film is no work of art but its kind of fun to watch just be warned that the beginning is quite gory,1
horrendous comedy in which a beautiful crazy woman liv tyler comedically destroys the lives of three men matt dillon paul reiser and john goodman dillon hires a hit man michael douglas to kill her what is happening to comedy the year 2001 has produced some of the worst comedies ever saving silverman sugar and spice freddy got fingered tomcats etc etc this is one of the worst theres not one repeat not one funny moment in it the jokes are either stupid unfunny smutty or real sick also theres a strong hatred of women in this garbagethe only main female character tyler is constantly used as a sex object also extreme bloody violence is thrown in at the end the only bearable moments come from reba mcentire as a psychiatrist and andrew dice clay in two rolesboth psychos dillon goodman and reiser have hit an alltime career low with thisthe only way to go is up and poor tyler she quit doing intelligent gutsy independent films for this and douglas what was he on when he agreed to this an utter piece of crapto be avoided at all costs,0
yet another early film from alfred hitchcock which seems to have been done out of contractual obligation as with juno and the paycock you can tell that hitchcock had little interest in this movie there is almost no style or craft to it at all the story revolves around fred and emily a young married couple who come into some money and go on a cruise which proves to be a test of their marriage emily is given a chance at a new life with a good hearted wealthy man who falls in love with her but chooses to take the high road and stay with her husband this might seem more believable if fred werent made out to be a completely insensitive pompous ass who jumps at the first opportunity he sees to leave his wife for another woman the couple ends up staying together but the movie lacks any real reconciliation scene the third act goes in a completely different direction with the couple stranded on an abandoned ship and rescued by an asian fishing boat joan barry does give a very stirring performance as the faithful wife of an unfaithful husband thats about all you can say for this one,0
thats the worst film i saw since a long time historic accuracy is totally nonexistent for example james wolfe who his depicted as an antifrench canadian is shown in london during the summer of 1759 natives are like indians of a bad hollywood movie of the 60s they wear deerskin clothes and ride horses the montagnais had never ride horses the film is taking place in quebec city but footage is set in louisbourg showing the atlantic oceanbr br the original scenario was supposed to include the battle of the plains of abraham but the producers drop this idea saying that costs for uniforms and participants would be more than 4 millions dollars i think they never heard about reenactmentbr br all the movie is planned to be a new titanic an impossible love during an historic tragedy the fall of newfrance theres even a song performed by celine dion at the end of the movie yes i stayed till the end of the movie but i deeply regret but the worst thing of all is that this movie cost 30 millions dollars i just dont know how they spend all this moneybr br sorry for my anger but im just too irritated,0
cmon people look at the title lol i remember seeing this movie on saturday late night creature features years ago its a great cheesy monster flick with hilariously bad acting and two wonderfully moronic hillbillies that add to the schlock factor the 2 redneck boat rental guys are the movie lol and youll love the boat scene where the english guy and his wife are talking about all the stars and its midday and sunny bloody hilarious you can tell they just didnt care about plot they just wanted to blow through the filming of the movie as fast as possible bottom line youll love it if you love 70s schlock,1

it would be quite easy to make this movie sound fun a call girl gets shot in the forehead by a north korean spy but survives the bullet that is embedded in her brain makes her long for knowledge as well as sex unbeknownst to her she walks away from the shooting with the cloned finger of george w bush in her purse a key which can unlock the power to use nuclear armaments just call it a romp and at least a few people will show up to the theater im not sure how many did go to see this four year old film when it opened in new york this past april but i sincerely hope not many it sounds like a light and playful pinku flick but it has arthouse pretensions and is really just incredibly boring many pinku films in the past have been successful in their artistic aspirations but this films aspirations just make the time that elapses between the sex scenes excruciating and then the sex scenes arent even good ive seen some pretty outrageous stuff in dirty japanese movies ive never seen this country produce something with sex this dull the spice channel is more imaginative the only worthwhile thing in this movie is the body of the lead actress emi kuroda otherwise this is pure torture,0

i caught this movie on tv yesterday i had a certain curiosity about it being that it was directed by emilio estevez and starring him and his reallife dad martin sheen i love to see a movie about a fatherson relationship that involves a reallife father and son naturally theres an instant chemistry between sheen and estevez and their scenes of conflict are even more intense knowing that theyre actually related of course it helps that the two of them are both terrific actors ive seen martin sheen in intense roles before but i think this is emilios most intense rolebeing that i mostly recall him from the mighty ducks seriesand i was very impressed talent really does run in that family and kathy bates steals the movie in an oscarworthy performance she tugged at my heartstrings with every word of dialogue kimberly williamsthe beautiful actress from the father of the bride moviesis also very good holding her own among a group of talented veteran actors br br the movie is a bit stagey with dialogue thats obviously geared for the stage but that didnt bother me this is not meant to be an action movie this is a character study and for a film thats based on a play it never gets too claustrophobic when emilios character jeremy reminisces to his days in vietnam we actually see his harrowing memories brought to life br br the film is extremely powerful and realistic without being sentimental at the end i expected all the conflicts to be resolved and the family would become hunkydory but thats not how it turned out the ending made me cry without resorting to standard hollywood melodrama that proves reality is much more gripping than anything hollywood can conjure up br br if youre in the mood for a beautiful powerful drama with extremely wonderful performances that will knock your socks offplease check out this underrated gem hopefully one day martin and emilio will unite with charlie and they will all make a great film together br br my score 9 out of 10,1
i dont think the world was ready for this film i know i wasnt id been expected a standard lowbudget schlock exploitation potboiler instead i got the most intelligent reworking of shakespeare since peter greenaways prosperos books this should become the definitive film version of romeo and juliet it wont of course but thats the worlds loss,1
well this movie wasnt as horrible as i thought it would be i was expecting to give it one star i chose to give it three why well for a cheesy horrorscifi movie its not all that bad sure the characters are tacky as is their acting including a young leonardo dicaprio the effects cheap looking and the monsterswell lets just say that ive seen some more effective halloween costumes in elementary schools but there was something about this movie that made me watch it till the end a little bit of humor helped out a bit i guess and if you ever wanted to see an alien pass gas this movie will let you live your dream 310,0
i dont like using the word awful to describe any work of the cinema for which a great deal of time effort talent and money is spent in its creation but zefferellis attempt to adapt charlotte brontës novel jane eyre is a total waste of timebr br the script is lacking in finesse and power everything explained to the viewer in no uncertain terms leaving little to the imagination the lead actors are woefully miscast clearly hired for their star names and the musical score drippy and dull charlotte gainsbourg and william hurt have absolutely no chemistry with one another at all she is like a wet noodle worse even than joan fontaine who at least was capable of some modicum of emotional involvement in what should be a story of frustrated passion and william hurt acts the entire film on one tone and that tone is flat and devoid of energy of course the limp and vapid script does not aid any of these otherwise fine actors in their efforts to bring any whiff of life to this flickbr br joan plowrights mrs fairfax is like some disney creation who keeps popping up to sweeten scenes in which she would have been best left out br br there is no mystery surrounding the story of rochesters first wife the role of the wouldbe second wife played like a barbie doll by elle macphearson is an empty cipherbr br fiona shaw a very great actress is completely wasted as janes aunt mrs reed she would have been bettercast as mrs fairfax only amanda root as janes beloved school teacher evokes any authentic sympathy or believability br br i saw this version of jane eyre after viewing robert youngs for british television made in 1997 starring ciaran hinds samantha morgan and gemma jones there is no comparison youngs vital romantic and deeply moving version is like an exploding nova compared to zefferellis wet squibbr br i will be interested now to see the 1970 version with timothy dalton about which ive read some very good things on this website i am amazed at how many people liked zefferellis yorkshire picture book br br about all i can say good about this film is that the house is beautiful and the cinematography vividly colored beyond that it is a complete dud,0
just got back from the european premiere of the gamers dorkness risingbr br all i can say is that if you are a gamer crpg rpg or larp then this movie is for you and if youre not a gamer well its still a great deal of funbr br the acting is certainly not oscarworthy but in the whole element of the movie it adds to the charm the humour is everywhere along with some very nice touches the tribute to gary gygax is especially well done if you can spot it the cast are very down to earth in their appearance befitting the fact that they are ordinary people enjoying an ordinary hobbybr br the quality of the movies sound and vision are adequate but again it all just adds to the atmosphere that helps to define this movie as being the dungeons and dragons movie written and performed by gamers for gamersbr br not afraid to use terminology specific to one system they still manage to allow product placement to be a part of the movie but in a very understandable and utterly fair manner it also touches on some of the perceived prejudices that some gamers can have about other gamers and deals with that quite wellbr br all in all the movie is very much driven by an wellthoughtout equal balance of character plot and entertainment the bard is amazingly good valueformoneybr br in the end it does make scoring this movie quite hard so i have given it 2 scoresbr br score for nonrpers 710 a few moments could go way over your head but the main sections of the movie just work so hard and achieve so much morebr br score for rpers 1010 everything fits together in the perfect quantities and with the perfect charm and sentiment,1
the movie andaz apna apna in my books is the top 5 intelligent comedy movies ever made in bollywood perhaps even hollywood br br when the movie released i was a 8 year old and i heard it was a flop but i never understood till now why was it a flopbut let me tell you one thingthis movie would have more money by selling home cassettes and dvds and by showing in tv movie channels than any hit movie in theaters this movie has been shown countless times in movie channels and i think even now the public love and the tv producers keep repeating the movie again and again i personally have watched the entire movie more than 80 100 times and i still love itbr br the performance by both aamir khan as amar and salman khan as prem is mind blowing but i especially liked the performance of aamir khan as a street smart guyhis dialogs in the movie are hilarious the story is simple and heres how it goesbr br amar and prem are poor lazy chaps and come from a poor family of tailors and amars father is a barber then they both get a news that a millionaire s daughter from london is coming to india to look for a suitable match both amar and prem think that this is a brilliant opportunity to become super richtherefore they both head out to woo raveena tandonthe millionaires daughterin their journey they both hate each other and each one of them try to fool the other in order to marry raveenathe comedy scenes in between are so hilarious that you would need a glass of water to stop the pain in your stomach by laughingand then there is raveenas uncle millionaires look alike brother teja who wants to take revenge from raveenas fathersince he is broke and raveenas dad is a millionairehis plans include kidnapping raveena to blackmail raveenas dad for which he hires 2 butlersbr br but later on we get to know that there is a twist in the movie watch the movie to knowthen there is shakti kapoor as crime master gogo who is also incredibly funnybr br the thing which stood out for me were the dialogs in the movie which has become a legend of sortsaamir khan uses his aaila brilliantly and salman goes like ooima and for gogo there is jab raat ko bacha soota nahi hain to ma bolti hain ki sooja nahi to gogo aa jaega each and every scene is so funnybr br i especially liked the one in which aamir khan and salman goto get raveena from teja and they both go in a luna having chillar money in a bagthat scene is so funnybr br i recommend anyone who understands hindi or urdu to watch this movie this is one movie that i would recommend having a dvd and you will never regret,1
the story itself is routine a boy runs away from home and ends up in a struggling music school for kids he convinces a famous violinist to sponsor the school the film is a splicing of shootings over 11 weeks and leaves many amusing holes which the observant viewer may find for himherselfbr br however long the whiskers of the plot might have been the movie is justified by its music and acting there is plenty of music featuring classical works played by heifetz and by the meremblum orchestra one of the leading youth symphonies of that day and said music is excellent by itself it would make the picture worth viewing the conducting and scoring duties were put in the best of hands those of alfred neumannbr br the acting is a study in contrasts the kids in the orchestra most of whom had little or no acting experience must have driven director archie mayo crazy looking into the camera overacting the parts that they had and overstudiously following directions given to them but the spontaneity that results from their lack of training adds an interesting charm to the picture the veteran actors were marvelous with the material they had to work with walter brennan was perfectly cast in his role one that he emulated in real life joel mccrea and andrea leeds were ideal fits for their parts and the supporting acting was a veritable whos who of character actors marjorie main arthur hohl paul harvey charles coleman perry ivins and porter hall in his typical role of the heavyall ideally cast and the bit players jessie arnold john hamilton marjorie wood jimmy flavin dulcie day the gravelly voiced lee phelps in his usual role as a policeman and many many more if youre a fan of character actors this movie will bring back a lot of memoriesbr br overall the picture is very enjoyable and is recommended even if you arent a fan of classical musicbr br tvcat,1
this is the dreary tale of the self absorbed affair between two unlikable people one of whom is married to someone else it ranks high on my list of most boring movies ever and im a die hard romantic my husband opted out after the first hour of its three by which time little had transpired the desert scenery is spectacular with the endless sand and the sunshine on katharines golden hair however cinematography does not a brilliant film make unless its a national geographic travelogue the magnificent saharan scenery in this ill conceived tale is like putting perfume on a pigbr br the movie revolves around a badly burned dying pilot named count laszlo de almasy who is left in the care of a canadian army nurse hana during world war ii italy he appears to remember little of his life but through a book in his possession his story is very slowly revealed with the help of a man from his past named caravaggio who mysteriously appears at his deathbed almasy was a hungarian cartographer employed by the royal geographical society to chart the sahara desert he entered into an affair with the wife katherine of a fellow explorer who proved to be a british spy meanwhile in the present laszlos nurse has her own affair with a sikh nicknamed kip who is involved in the dangerous work of disarming minesbr br my quarrels with this movie are many length and tedium for starters i dont fault the acting in particular it simply isnt a good story caravaggio seems unnecessary his connection to almasy sketchy he provides a torture scene but appears to serve no essential purpose in the filmbr br the core problem is that the two parties of this affair almasy and katharine are woefully unsympathetic characters shallow and dull they simply arent very nice thus there is no one to cheer for almasy is cool aloof haughty and eventually disgustingly possessive of another mans wife katharine is likewise detached and nasty not to mention having a deplorable lack of guilt or feeling whatsoever for her imperfect but loving husbandapart from managing one minuscule tear at the corner of her eye when he dies br br this is a tale of lust rather than love with such pearls as i can still taste you almasy ridiculously vocalizes to a colleague his erotic obsession with the indentation in his beloveds neck surely more indicative of a focus on katharines body the victim of this unrepentant adultery is the hapless husband geoffrey who is treated as little more than an unpleasant nuisance its all quite sordid and disgusting katharines charade of feeling faint so that these lovers can indulge in their much vaunted unbridled passion all as silent night is being sung in the background im not sure whether the intent was to contrast the carols purity with their selfish lust but i definitely was not impressed by the sacrilegious undertone we have full frontal nudity with katharine but their sex scenes come across as cold selfish lustful and sometimes,0
this was a classic case of something that should never have been gloria was now a single mother her husband had left her because she wouldnt live in some commune with him he was mad that reagan had been elected and wanted to turn his back on society right then and there i had problems with the series come on i say to myself is this the same noble michael stivic that countered archie bunkers right winged philosophies the series went on but it just didnt have any pizazz whatever momentum sally struthers gained from all the family was long gone maybe if the series had been given another name and presented as being totally independent of all in the family it might have worked out ah well thats show business,0
baseketball is an extremely funny movie that delivers acting that generally makes the movie alot funniercomedy material that is more than crap in your pants funnyand a pretty good plot despite the fact that its the classic slackers vs the evil rich guythe one and only thing i didnt like about baseketballwas that that kid wasnt really needed in the moviebutif the kid wasnt in the moviesome of the funny scenes wouldnt have existedif you have read any pro reviews about this movieexclude them all because basically all the reviewers didnt like this filmbaseketball is a great comedy that gives everyone what they want8 out of 10,1
the minion is about well a minion a servant of satan and whose goal is to get the key that will unlock the door where his master is trapped he is some sort of demon who possess human beings and when the body dies will possess another anyone who happens to be possessed will go on some berserker rage dolph lundgren plays lukas a member of a secret order of templars who is tasked to keep the key away from the minion the movie begins a thousand years ago in the middle east where a couple of knight templars flee from the minion then flash forward to 1999 where the key winds up somewhere underground in new york an archeologist is assigned to studydig the place where the key was found needless to say the minion is after the key and the movie becomes a long winded chase scene between the minion and lukas and archeologistbr br the movie is just that a low budget bmovie flick the movie lacks energy and just trods along youll follow the chase but you wont ever feel involved in the story which willfully takes ideas from previous movies especially the terminator films the fight scenes with the minion is troublesome in that you never get the sense of how good or how bad a warrior this demon is it skillfully becomes a oneman army when fighting a squad of templars but sucks when it comes to oneon one and its supposed to be around for a long time all this goes to show that any sense of logic is just thrown down the drain for convenience the whole idea of a secret order of templars a door to hell and the key isnt well explained we are merely to accept that they just exist the movie seems to have been made with the feeling theres not much potential to the story but only enough to make a few bucks dolph lundgren sure looks like he wish he were somewhere elsebr br the verdict 2 of 5 stars,0
this film features two of my favorite guilty pleasures sure the effects are laughable the story confused but just watching hasselhoff in his knight rider days is always fun i especially like the old hotel they used to shoot this in it added to what little suspense was mustered give it a 3,0
best in show is a often hilarious mockumentary that takes us into the world of dog shows and some of the dog owners who prepare for the event the only thing that separates this movie from real dog shows is that the dogs in best in show act more sane than their owners funny stuff from a topnotch cast that includes eugene levy who cowrote the film catherine ohara parker posey michael mckean jennifer coolidge jane lynch and christopher guest who cowrote with levy and directed theyre all funny but fred willard steals the movie with his explosively funny performance as the dog show announcer who says the most outrageous things plus the dogs are cute too best in show isnt exactly the laugh riot that i expected but there are laughs and its worth seeingbr br out of four,1
when you look back at another bad nightmare sequel like freddys revenge you have to at least give it some credit for trying something new and although the dream child is more enjoyable it offers absolutely nothing new to the series yes theres the creative deaths as usual like a kid becoming part of a comic book and facing super freddy but even scenes like that arent used to their full potential and the parts without freddy are just boringbr br this marked the official death of scariness to the series freddy seems to be the comedic relief nowbut to whatbr br my rating 410,0
i was very lucky to see this film as part of the melbourne international film festival 2005 only a few days ago i must admit that i am very partial to movies that focus on human relations and especially the ones which concentrate on the tragic side of life i also love the majority of scandinavian cinematic offerings there is often a particular deep quality in the way the story unfolds and the characters are drawn character building in this film is extraordinary in its details and its depth this is despite the fact that we do encounter quite a number of characters all with very particular personal situations and locations within their community the audience at the end of the screening was very silent and pensive i am still playing some of those scenes in my mind and i am still amazed at their power and meaningfulness,1
i bought this at tower records after seeing the infomercial about fifteen hundred times on comedy central i was actually really looking forward to watching this my god where did i go wrong now before i give my review let me just say that i am a person who can pretty much find the good in all movies hell i own over 1500 dvds with that said the underground comedy movie ranks up there with the worst film i have ever seen i tried to give it a chance but not only was it not funny it had no point did not offend whatsoever and was all around stupid god who in their right mind thought these pieces of crap were funny this is going right to the bottom of the bin,0
notorious for more than a quarter century and often banned its obscurity was its greatest asset it seems hey its often better to be talked about rather than actually seen when you cant back the legend up with substancebr br the film has played in los angeles a couple of times recently and is available on home video so that veil is slowly being lifted while there is still plenty to offend the masses it is more likely to bore them than arouse much real passion except for a gratuitous and protracted xxx sex scene between a pair of horses nature documentary anyone there follows nearly an hour of a dull arranged marriage melodrama br br once the sex and nudity begins it is a nonstop sequence involving masturbation a looooooooong flashback to an alleged beauty and the beast encounter and a naked woman running around the mansion nobody even her supposedly protective aunt seems to even think of putting some clothes on her on video i guess you can fastforward thru the banality but its not really worth the effort the nudity doesnt go beyond what is seen in something much more substantive such as bertoluccis the dreamersbr br try as one might to find some moral or symbolism in the carnality i doubt its worthy of anyones effort unfortunately for la bete now that you can more easily see the film the notoriety of something once forbidden has been lifted and this beast has been tamed,0
this is a movie that should be seen by everyone if you want to see great acting mr torn and ms farrel do an outstanding job i think they should have it on tv again so a new audience can enjoy it wonderful performancesbr br it gives you a real feel of what the pioneers had to go through both physically and emotionally great unheard of moviebr br it was done when ms farrel was very young i had always thought of her as a comedian but this certainly is not a comedy and she is just wonderful there is very little dialogs but that just make it seem more real mr torn as always is a great presence and just his breathing has great feeling i must see movie,1
i consider stuart bliss the worst movie i have ever seenbr br the acting was terrible and the plot ludicrous i get the fact that the main characters wife leaving him triggered a mental breakdown but it got so silly and boring after a while i could have cared less about any of the charactersbr br the movie kept going over and over the same ideas without anything fresh or surprising to add to the plot the whole thing with the geiger counter got too much after a while after stuart started opening up his wall to see what was behind it after the counter indicated something was therebr br then there was the repetitive scenes with the flyer and the confusing ones where he meets himselfbr br i should have guessed that this movie was a flop when i didnt recognize any of the actors do yourself a favor when this movie comes up read a book youll be better off,0
since crouching tiger hidden dragon came along theres been a lot of talk about a revival of the hong kong movie industry dont believe it the people now making movies in hk give new meaning to the word crass running out of time 2 is a perfect example ekin cheng is the name draw here but he spends most of the film just grinning idiotically and flipping a coin he flips the coin over and over and again and again why who knows sean lau plays a cop who chases after the coinflipping pretty boy but once again who knows why theres a pretty actress in the female lead who runs some sort of company and she has to pay a ransom or something but she mostly just looks like she would rather be at a spa or shopping centre than in front of a camera nothing makes any sense there is no action there is no sex there is no comedy all there is is a name ekin cheng and you know what who cares,0
there is a serious scene in this movie a scene that lets you know that his film wont be pulling many cheap punches it takes place in a crowded train station and the protagonists are ambushed by assassins with automatic weapons they make a break for it and just manage to get out in a hail of gunfire the main hall of the train station is now filled with corpses of innocent people that were caught in the crossfire some would call that too sad andor grim to put into what is supposed to be an enjoyable action flick i call it honesty most action movies tend to lean toward the safe side of showing violence and plot elements this mostly means that in spite massive shootouts innocent people tend not to die or at least we dont see them die the violence is all purely the good guys versus the bad guys with mainly the bad guys dying a bit of common sense clearly shows this to be absurdbr br renny harlin showed a hint of this in his first and sadly only hit die hard 2 the villains intentionally crash a plane full of people to get their point across the scene was also filmed with a backup scene of a cargo plane with only a few people onboard going down but the grimmer and probably more realistic scenario ended up being used however to fit the spirit of the first film die hard 2 was mostly a fun action movie here that grimmer and more convincing edge is pervasive the violence is bloody the one liners are hilarious but with a certain style that more echoes natural human sarcasm than clichéd film wisecracks at key moments of action the plot is also packed with more malicious intent than most action films the villain is not just some rogue out for revenge or a mad grab at power it is less ridiculous but also more frightening than that from recent films the bourne trilogy almost gets there with its less cheesy than usual action film style but this film is from 1996 and 7 years before the bourne identity with matt damon made it to the big screenbr br another interesting aspect is that the main hero is actually a heroine and this is well before the movie version of tomb raider became a hit whats more is that this heroine genuinely looks like she could take down john mcclane and then take his still lit cigarette this movie marks geena daviss second actionheroine role and she still didnt manage to score a hit while angelina jolie stars in tomb raider years later and scores a hit the reasons are beyond me completelybr br lastly this movie isnt all dark edged there are many outrageous and spectacular set pieces that one can only see in an action film the climatic explosion of a chemical bomb is an absolutely spectacular display of movie pyrotechnics with more than one law of physics taking a convenient break thus there is formula here but,1
this is a really funny and sexy movie that is not just silly but has great acting its the kind of movie where the characters are so entertaining that you feel like you are connected to everyone in the theater i saw it at the boston film festival and i found myself frequently laughing out loud with everyone else and also moved by some of the movies more serious parts its a unique movie about two doctors and i dont want to give anything away but there are some powerful scenes as well really funny ones plus the dialogue is great wood harris character has a unique relationship with his girlfriend zoe saldana and brian white and mya are also funny and sexy in their roles if you get a chance to see it go you wont be disappointed its worth seeing again wood harris deserves an award,1
i cant add an awful lot to the positive reviews already on here great acting balanced writing multifaceted characters a great antihero in tony great commentary on millennial american life the integral use of psychiatry coupled with tonys mother issues are especially fresh and humorous several other characters add a lot of depth heshs interesting history as an outsider muscling in ralphies total irredeemable viciousness chris dual desires in life and so onbr br i have to dig into some of the criticisms however especially the it glorifies violencebelittles italianamericans onemost of the writers and actors are italianamerican would they attack themselves there are several positive italianamerican characters artie bucco the chef dr melfi and her family and the cusamanos next door to the sopranos indeed dr melfis exhusband notes in season 1 that only a tiny minority of italianamericans have ever had mob connections certainly smaller than the proportion of africanamericans involved in crime dare i say it in both cases poverty and lack of opportunity are the biggest causesbr br most of the characters dont really choose the life they have family background or circumstances largely corner them into it outsiders even of italian stock who attempt to integrate into it usually meet distressing ends matthew and his friend in season 2 for example if you criticise this show i assume frasier made you want to be a psychiatrist or will grace made you want to go homosexual presumably you wont listen to rap music that discusses gangs or rnb which discusses promiscuity or rock music which discusses drugs or any other combination people arent as stupid as some of you make outbr br not everything is perfect however a lot of characters have only appeared once when by all logic they should have been seen or at least mentioned in previous episodes tracee the dancer meadows friend ally uncle juniors ladyfriend supposedly for 20 years until they split in season 1,1
you want to see the movie the gamers by dead gentlemen productions this is not that movie this movie is not funny it is a waste of timebr br all of the good comments here seem to be written by poorly disguised false third parties the people who made this movie seem to be attempting to synthesize fake interestbr br this movie is not a well done mockumentary comparisons to spinal tap or christopher guest are insultingbr br the movie is so meanspirited that i cannot imagine anyone familiar with the subject matter finding it funny being able to laugh at yourself is an important quality but if you are the ones being lampooned in this manner youd have to hate yourself to enjoy itbr br the movie is not offensive because of its grand satire of taboo topics but because of its constant pathetic banality,0

this film must have been quietly released on some other side of the world perhaps even in english hopefully nobody understood a word not theres anything to understand in this movie anyways haahaa call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever why would i come to that conclusion because its my national pasttime to sabotage horrible films and this one begs for it every other minute once i became a fan of myster science theater 3000 i had no doubt in my mind theyd find it somewhere and use it sure enough the version they acquired was entitled cave dwellers using some strange intro footage not even from the film itself apparently they were ashamed to use footage from their own film i cant say i recommend buying this film rather i highly recommend getting the mst3k version sure to find it most anywhere mst3k dvds are sold dont miss out,1

i love dissing this movie my peers always try their best to defend it probably out of love for quentin tarantino or harvey keitel but theyll never convince me that this one should be treasured heres some huge reasons why a the plot goes from kidnapping road trip movie to vampireinhabited strip bar slasher flick with no setup whatsoever suddenly something very real turns into something very fake which is like sitting the audience down to a thanksgiving feast then exploding it with dynamite b that untalented juliette lewis is in it c preposterous ideas abound such as actual torsoandleg guitars brothers with the last name gecko bad vampire makeup jobs cheech marin playing three characters and a crotchbased gun that only fires when erect and belongs to a guy who goes by sex machine if robert rodriguez didnt pathetically try to be so innovative with his violence i mightve had fun with this obvious popcorn flick the whole projects like he got the ideas by playing with action figures the only thing even close to being considered my favorite scene is george clooneys laughoutloud cheesy monologue after he kills his bloodsucking hornyforchildren terribleacting brother i swear i think they thought it up right then and there this movies out to offend and ends up offending those who want the offensive horrible movie,0

ok here it is nazi mountaineer befriends the dalai lama what we do is first we get a major star with no idea whatsoever how to do a germanic accent and we let him flounder around between french german american and british for over 2 hours then we concoct a series of wildly improbable events and space them apart very widely so that the plot inches along almost imperceptibly but just to make sure the viewer doesnt fall asleep we throw in details which are shockingly absurd such as our hero smoking a cigarette at an altitude of 22000 feet naturally we must also remember that our target audience does not want to read too many subtitles so we have every character even the lowliest peasant in the forbidden closedoff city of lhasa in 1943 speak perfect english also with dubious accents of course the trickiest part is how to handle the spiritual and political aspects of the story so what we do is this we have the dalai lama befriend the nowreformed nazi because the latter is so good at fiddling with film projectors radios antique cars and any other devices with represent the freedom of the capitalist west in return our hero learns from his young protegé a kind of vague undefined buddhism which is never really brought out or treated in a serious fashion we also have lots of scenes with the hero flaunting all the marks of respects and protocol which the rest of the tibetan society accords the dalai lama even as we pretend that the hero has deep and profound reverence for these people and their spiritual leader in other words we just expect the audience to believe that this guy is now a buddhist sort of in his own way even though we ourselves dont seem to know what his transformation entails or how far we want it to go and last but not least we hang a statistic onto the end of the film about how appallingly the chinese have treated the tibetans which is certainly true thus opening ourselves up to charges that we have made a political movie even though it is nothing of the sort so zat ist my idea vat do you zink can ve make zis movie,0
ive always believed that david and bathsheba was a film originally intended for tyrone power at 20th century fox although gregory peck does give a good account of himself as king david the monarch with a wandering eyebr br a whole lot of biblical subjects get covered in this film adultery redemption sin punishment and generally what god expects from his followersbr br when youre a king even king in a biblically prophesied kingdom you certainly do have a lot perogatives not open to the rest of us king david has many wives including one really vicious one in jayne meadows who was the daughter of saul davids predecessor but his eyes catch sight of bathsheba out in her garden one evening turns out shes as unhappily married to uriah the hittite as david is to quite a few women uriah is one of davids army captains david sends for bathsheba and him being the king she comes a runnin because shes had her eye on him toobr br what happens an affair a pregnancy and a carefully arranged death for uriah in a battle but an all seeing and knowing deity has caught all of this and is not only punishing david and bathsheba but the entire kingdom of israel is being punished with drought disease and pestilencebr br the sexist law of the day calls for bathsheba to have a stoning death david shows weakness in his previous actions but here he steps up to the plate and asks that the whole thing be put on him he even lays hands on the ark of the covenant which was an instant death as seen in the filmbr br my interpretation of it is that god admires guts even if youre wrong and he lets up on david and forgives them both bathsheba becomes the mother of solomon and she and david are the ancestors of several successors in the divided kingdoms of israel and judah until theyre both conqueredbr br susan hayward is a fetching bathsheba caught in a loveless marriage with uriah played by kieron moore the only thing that gets moore aroused is a good battle i liked kieron moores performance as a brave and rather stupid horses rear br br no one can lay the law down like raymond massey his nathan the prophet is in keeping with the john brown character he played in two films same intensity br br so when his own law called for death why did god spare bathsheba and keep david on the throne maybe it was the fact he just didnt want to train a third guy for the job hed replaced saul with david already br br but i think the christian interpretation might be that this was a hint of the new testament forthcoming that one might sin and receive mercy if one asks for it penitently ill leave it to the biblical scholars to submit interpretationsbr br watch the film and you might come up with an entirely new theory,1
as a new resolution for this year 2005 i decide to write a comment for each movie i saw in theater 10 or in dvd 90 br br i must admit that dvd have revolutionized this habit for instance i can hear the true voice of the cast which is an essential trait of the personality in my country non french movies are dubbed and we end up with aberrations french voice is terrible very far away of its original tone the same voice for different people or a same people with different voices br br and well if everybody found my comments unuseful well in 2006 i will stop my reviews ahah so enjoy them now br br my summary means that the story locations cast is not very enjoyablebr br onlybr br sandra bullock is there she is a talented actress able to get the viewer to catch on the moviebr br it reminds of a feminine the fugitive so if you look for a moment of escaping your life watching this movie makes it worse because sandras life is a messbr br she got nothing left to hold on to only her poor mother who is alzheimer ill again the touch for depressionbr br in fact she has a sad life in the beginning of the movie has a sadder life throughout it to finally get back to it at the end what a happy ending br br maybe the writers wanted to make a point about a nerds lifebr br very far away from the best computer movie of all time wargames,0
everyone is entitled to an opinion the only critic who counts is yourself i think this is a great movie much better than the originalbr br in caddyshack rodney dangerfield is funny but obnoxious he was asked to do the sequel but things got in the way jackie mason shows the saying that less is more he is funny but a man with real family issues a more rounded person its no drama but a movie that makes you feel actually in some points you feel sorry for jackie mason especially when his daughter walks out on himbr br it has a good soundtrack and overall a good sorry a good end to the seriesbr br in the tv show alf alf says that he cried in terms of endearment the wife kate tanner played by anne schedeen also says he cried at caddyshack 2,1
the story of ed gein is a disturbing and terrifying story ed was truly a messed up character and his legacy went on to inspire such greats as the tooth fairy norman bates and leatherface how is it then that such a fascinating man has inspired such a boring melodramatic piece of drivel ed gein made belts out of nipples bowls out of skulls lamps out of skin danced around under the moon in suits of human skin none of this made it into the movie because they needed to give us a fictitious story of a ridiculously awful deputy and his rather homely sexstarved girlfriend this movie seemed to go out of its way to falsify history what baffles me is that most movies stray from the path of truth to exaggerate history this one seems to do it to minimize it i just dont get it,0
i had heard about this movie through a friend it was supposed to be a thriller but what i watched wasnt a thriller it was more like a weak attempt at one amber smith was a bright spotthat may be giving her too much credit the scenes were she was in bed with actress erika michels were also lame the two actresses did not seem to click with each other at all amber smith was way out of this gals league and it definitely showed on camera she did not seem into those scenes at all i was disappointed because a friend of mineguy of coursehad pumped this movie up to be something great but it was actually more like watching dime store porn,0
this is not a movie for fans of the usual eerie lynch stuff rather its for those who either appreciate a good story or have grown tired of the runofthemill stuff with overt sentimentalism and oprahish this is such a wonderful movie you must see itsemantics tho she is right for oncebr br the story unfolds flawlessly and we are taken along a journey that i believe most of us will come to recognize at some time a compassionate existentialist journey where we make amends för our past when approaching ourt inevitable demisebr br acting is without faults cinematography likewise occasionally quite brilliant and the dialogue leaves out just enough for the viewer to grasp the details od the storybr br a warm movie not excessively sentimental,1
this is one of those unique horror films that requires a much more mature understanding of the word horror in order for it to be appreciated the main thing people may fail to realize that this story is told through the point of view a little boy and as with most younger children he gets frightened easily mainly because he simply doesnt understand things like why his father is hardly ever there for him from watching the film you can see the husband arguing with his wife the balance between work time and family time and you can easily understand it but the little boy doesnt also one can imagine the boy being afraid of the woods as it is established early on in the film that the family is from the city also in the beginning as the family is traveling to the house they hit a deer then get held up then they argue with the locals about it and the little boy surely didnt find this introduction to the woods pleasant at allbr br the wendigo is ultimately what his young innocent mind fabricates to explain all of this there is the american indian legend but when looking at the scene where the young boy hears about about it it is explained to him like bluntly and simplistically not because thats what the wendigo actually is but because that is how he understands it when you look at the film from this point of view you can really begin to appreciate it obviously it was lowbudget and shot cheaply but the jumping montages use of light and general eeriness more than make up for it and the final question the film asks is is it all in your head or is it really out there 810br br rated r profanity violence and a sex scene,1
are you familiar with concept of childrens artwork while it is not the greatest picasso any threeyearold has ever accomplished with their fingers you encourage them to do more if painting is what makes them happy there should be no reason a parent should hold that back on a child typically if a child loves to paint or draw you will immediately see the groundwork of their future style you will begin to see their true form in these very primitive doodles well this concept of childrens artwork is how i felt about fuquas depressingly cheap and uncreative film bait while on all accounts it was a horrid film it was impressive to see fuquas style begin emerging through even the messiest of moments if you have seen either training day or king arthur you will be impressed with the birth of this director in his second film bait while foxx gives a horrid unchained performance there are certain scenes which define fuqua and demonstrate his brilliance behind the camera sadly it only emerged in the final thirty minutes of the film but if you focus just on those scenes you will see why fuquas name appears on so many best of film listsbr br i will never disagree with someone that fuquas eye behind the camera is refreshing and unique his ability to place a camera in the strangest of places to convey the simplest of emotions is shocking i am surprised that more of hollywood hasnt jumped aboard this bandwagon even in the silly feature bait you are witness to fuquas greatness two scenes that come directly to mind are the explosion scene near the middle of the film and the horse scene close to the end in both of these scenes i saw the director fuqua at work alas in the rest of this film all i saw was a combination of nearly every action film created the likable hero down on his luck that suddenly finds his life turned around by some unknown force is a classic structure that just needs to die in hollywood we have seen this two often and no matter who you are unless you are charlie kaufmann you cannot recreate the wheel it is just impossible with this genre and it is proved with bait i was annoyed with fuqua for just sitting back and allowing this to happen which could explain why it took me three viewings to finish this film i was just tired of the structure and while i hoped that fuqua would redefine it he did notbr br then there was the acting while jamie foxx has never impressed me as an actor i was willing to give this helmed vehicle a try i wanted to see if he could pull off another dramatic role similar to collateral i was under the impression that perhaps this was the film chosen to show producers that foxx could handle the role in collateral again i was disappointed foxx was annoying not in the sense that it was the way that his,0
if you like stupid jokes and a terribly predictable storyline then perhaps this movie is for you courtney thornesmith jack warden and several other members of the supporting cast actually have talent but it was completely stifled by the paperthin script this is a generally boring and joyless time waster of a movie,0

i am an actorproducer director and what i am about to say are facts this project was the worst film in movie making history from producer to director and the edit of this so called film is a joke and i mean a big joke why would blockbuster released such crap i take my work very serious and this film is an insult to my profession was the director trying to make a bad movie i dont think so i seen bad zombie movies but this takes the cake the coffie and everything on the damn table this movie sucks i really hate to talk bad about other filmmakers because i am one myself but please consider in taking up a different profession i respect the fact that you completed a movie but i have to ask you were you smoking crack i mean the makeup on your girls the scary zombies what were you thinking to the whole nation if i could have voted zero i would have worst film in movie making history,0
i rented a copy of this one from netflix big mistake the dvd version titled the onearmed swordsmen was produced by madmen who thought that the fighting sequences would be appreciated better pasted all together in one big chapter than as part of a consistent sequential story some of the story was left in separate chapters which you can select from the main menu but the dvd is still a mess dont rent or buy it not that there was anything wonderful about the original story an absurdly complicated piece of nonsense much as i liked seeing wang yu in his prime again after all these years this one is an utter waste of time ive had dish detergents that made a better film than this what the choppedup dvd version shows us is that no matter how silly a chinese script may be you have to see some sort of story to care about how the fighting sequences turn outbr br but the onearmed swordsmen does offer you do the chance to see both wang and shaw brothers stalwart lo lieh beating up smirking pretty boy david chiang its always a pleasure to see that happen lo plays a sort of secondstring villain here and serves as a prime example of why some people really need orthodontists he film is also graced by the participation of taiwanese actor chang yi as the magistrate br br another comment above mentions the obligatory fightintheinn scene there are two in fact where wang and chiang are attacked by a pack of comical barbarians using what look like cavemen weapons making bruce lee noises while they fight none of this makes any sense but thats okay if youre not expecting any clarity or common sense it was fun to watch anywaybr br another peculiarity of this production is that there are no significant women characters there are a couple of female roles but they play no serious role in the action or the plotbr br if you can find a copy of the original shaw brothers onearmed swordsman movie the one which explains why he has only the one arm and why he uses a broken sword go for it,0
ba ba ba boring this is next to battlefield earth in science fiction slumberness genie francis aka general hospitals laura has a small role as a reporter and that in itself should tell you that this movie must be bad there is ben kingsley an academy award winning actor in this stinker and a few others decent actors you have to wonder what possessed them to decide to do this awful movie the music dramatically goes up and down like its a major dramatic story even if you pay attention the plot is impossible to follow the effects are mediocre as well and seem really dated all of the actors speak in a monotone voice and have no realism to their dialogue i could go on and on on how this is a bad movie at least with battlefield earth its so bad its funny but this is just b o r i n g avoid unless you want to be lulled to sleep,0
i saw this directors woman on the beach and could not understand the good to great reviews this film is much like that one two people who are caught in a relationship with very little dynamic and even less interest to anyone else like his other films you have to want to listen to vacuous dialog wade through very little and become enchanted with underwritten pretty uninteresting characters if you feel you can like this film dont let my review stop you i do like minimalism in films but i feel tsai mingliangs films are far superior he has a fairly terrific actor in lee kangsheng in his films there is nothing here i wish iu liked it but i dont oh well,0
i bought the video rather late in my collecting and probably would have saved a lot of money if i bought it earlier it invariably supersedes anything else on those cosmos moon nights cher and olympia certainly deserve their awards but this is really a flawless ensemble performance of a superb screenplay what you dont know what a cosmos moon is,1
this entry doesnt contain a spoiler it doesnt have to the movie is as predictable as the sunrise the element in the first alien movies was the suspense that something could happen this was so in the first two predator movies though less prevalent requiem has totally removed the element of suspense and replaced it with blood and gore you know people are going to die well duh it is a avsp movie but you know who is going to die and when they are going to die and where they are going to die before it happens the directors should take a lesson from hitchcock who said suspense is not a time bomb going off under a table suspense is a bomb not going off under the table whats the sense in going to a movie when you know exactly what is going to happen and when if you really really want to watch this movie wait until it comes out on video and then rent it but by no means would i ever buy it,0
i am a youth pastors wife and we took some youth to see this film we then spent an hour trying to explain it to them they didnt get it and i didnt enjoy it it is based on a concept that has run through all three of the major religions of the world the bible code the torah code and the code in the koran and is so questionable as to be laughable this is not a step forward for christians in the arts it is a step forward for those who believe we check our brains at the door,0
i used this film in a religion class i was teaching the golden fish is swimming happily in his bowl in an upper floor apartment a young boy and his mother are away from home the boy has been given money to buy milk on the way home he stops at carnival to play a game next to him stands a man in a black suit looking a little scary the boy drops the bottle of milk it breaks the man in the black suit gives him money to replace the milk this scene alternates with what is happening at home a black cat climbs the fire escape and enters the apartment he discovers the fish bowl and watches it the fish swims energetically and flips out of the bowl by now a bunch of teenagers in my class and i have fallen in love with the fish the cat takes the fish in his mouth and we all hold our breath the cat drops the fish into the bowl the double story line includes the suspicious man in black and the suspicious black cat both inspire prejudice both are innocent it was a great discussion starter in my class,1
i thoroughly enjoyed this film which in many ways as hitchcock did on several occasions was a first attempt at a plot which he reshot later in his career possibly the most amazing thing about it however is how faceless the lead characters are after watching one remembers murray alper as the jovial truck driver vaughan glasers touching turn as a blind patriot the unforgettable traveling freak show and of course otto kruger as the suave and sophisticated villain all of whom completely overshadow bob cummings as the rather wooden fugitive compare that bridge jump to harrison fords similar stunt in andrew davis the fugitive and priscilla lane whose change of heart and subsequent love towards cummings is never quite believablebr br the other major support player is of course hitchcock himself who bookends the film with 2 extraordinary stunts many people criticise the older films for their lack of realistic special effects my feelings are that with lack of technology to even attempt and convey what the director wants to show is an amazing achievementbr br obviously this film carries an antifascist message made at the time of the second world war but being a hitchcock it is never the most important thing and the emphasis is always on the action well worth checking out especially for the support roles,1
there are other reviews here expressing similar views but i still feel impelled to add my comments the film is generally wellmade from a technical point of view apart from possibly being too long the acting is mostly very good although kevin spacey isnt given much space to explain his characters motivation apparently ambition rather than racism and sandra bullocks only function seems to be as eye candy which she admittedly manages very wellbr br at a fundamental level the films heart is in the right place in being opposed to racism and i get the impression that it tried to set out to be some kind of definitive treatment of racism perhaps why so many famous names agreed to be in it however it seems the writers bit off far more than they could chew i havent read the book so i dont know how much of that is down to grisham the biggest problem as many others have said is that it ends up advocating vigilante justice aside from the fact that i dont agree with that position i dont think that such a view actually helps the antiracist cause at all its more likely to be applied to acquit white defendants who kill black victims at the end the prosecutor invites the jury and the audience to imagine that the raped girl was white but follow that through and imagine the defendant to be a white man who murdered black rapists in the end the message seems to be that its ok to kill someone as long as you hate them enough its also convenient that the man killed was presented as totally evil and his guilt was in no doubt which removes any of the moral ambiguity likely in a real casebr br samuel l jackson gives an excellent performance but unfortunately this also undermines the plot he comes across as someone with considerable integrity but its hard to believe that he would be willing to hide behind an insanity plea and indeed he doesnt when push comes to shove were presumably supposed to think that its because he faces the death penalty but in fact at one point hes offered a plea of manslaughter although if you blink you might miss it why not take it given that he must know his chances of acquittal are slim or if he wants to make a stand in court why plead insanitybr br there are less serious flaws too the medical experts on whose testimony the case supposedly rests are jokes both are discredited for highly implausible reasons and neither of them offers any real psychiatric diagnosis the message seems to be that expert witnesses will say whatever theyre asked to say and shouldnt be believed the fact that the injured policeman supports jackson is moderately plausible but still a bit convenient and what if he had died i find it hard to believe that the kkk would march down the street in broad daylight other apparently serious crimes riot arson kidnapping attempted murder go by without any visible,0
johnny and jeremy are vampires of sorts minus the fangs of course theyre dark bitter creatures with nothing better to do than to spread their own misery through their charms namely a sharp tongue and a fat wallet respectively they seduce desperate souls who they proceed to torment and victimize thats more or less the basis of this black comedy as i understand itbr br its not a blend of black humor that i can easily subscribe to partly because it bothers me to imagine the audience rooting for the sleazy main character i did enjoy however the sound and the melody of the rapidfire and supposedly very witty remarks i was very impressed by the casts strong acting particularly david theliss only the character of jeremy seemed too bidimensional the photography and the music both dramatic and somber work very well together br br what really turns me off about naked and the main reason id never recommend it to anyone is the way it repeatedly seems to present misogyny as a valid way to vent ones angst in other words in a world that sucks so bad what difference does it make if one inflicts some pain on girls right to suggest as some have on this website that johnny is not so unkind a person because hes not as rough on girls as jeremy seems completely absurd to me theyre both terrible nasty people and theyre particularly keen on hurting women every single time they get a chance one could argue that johnny eventually gets what he deserves as if his bad karma suddenly swung straight back and bit him in the ass but still his and jeremys sadistic behavior are treated to a certain degree as a laughing matter and i could be wrong but im guessing that most people who absolutely love this movie also find that aspect of the film darkly comical,0
everything about this film is hog wash pitiful acting awful dialog ugly native girls this movie sinks into oblivion the director must have been a weekend bender robert c is totally lost and has not got a clue on what is going on the college kids are worst no acting talent at all very stupid reasoning and just down right dumbbells special effects are for the birds the so called security force around this park belongs in toy land with stupid looking guns walkie talkies that are useless and a computer system that ranks with a roll of toilet paper if the park is under construction and nothing works why bother inviting potential clients until everything is complete the writers should be the first victims of the mess along with the producers and the crew the whole film belongs in a septic tank shot to another planet for viewing what a gem convicts should have to watch this so they can commit suicide,0
this films makes no pretentious efforts to hide its true genre a campy b movie it will flat out tell you in the beginning the definition of campy it should have also given the adjective meaning of cheese but the two come together in this film in ways that make you go hmmmmm thats so stupid and then have you laughing for example there is a scene back in 16th century japan which shows a couple of samurai walking in the foreground of a temple in the background of the temple there are several tourists looking off in the distance in slippers and shorts hmmmm hahahah i could not stop laughing and the acting goes from decent to bearable to oh my lord but thats what makes it funny youll see some decent actors and then find others really terrible i have to digress somewhat though because i have seen stephanie sanchez in several plays and she is awesome her air time in the film was pretty short though i have also seen bryan yamasaki in several plays in the islands during my visits and hes also better in theatre than in this movie anyhow its an entertaining film if youve got nothing to do on a weekday evening,1
an extremely powerful film that certainly isnt appreciated enough its impossible to describe the experience of watching it the recent uk television adaptation was shameful too ordinary and bland this original manages to imprint itself in your memory,1
just saw this at the 2003 vancouver international film festival and it was funny as hell and a bit surreal takes place in toronto where these two losers live in this rundown house in the middle of a freeway system david hewlett pin cube cypher and andrew miller cube are just great as the two losers who wish the world would just go away the acting dialogue and writing are very good and the whole film looks great for such a lowbudget flick directorwriter vincenzo natali was in attendance at this screening and he seemed so intelligent and downtoearth this guy is so inventive with these great stories that work so well within small budgets it puts big budget hollywood crap to shame,1
as i peruse through the hundreds of comments that loyal readers of the imdb have posted on this film i find it very interesting how few middle of the road comments there are everyone either loves it or they hate it having seen apocalypse now approximately 30 times and having recently dissected it on dvd how did we ever live without those magical digital machines i can say without hesitation that i am one of those who have a very special place in my heart for this film why would you like a film thats so confusing ask many of my associates the answer is this forget the war forget the brutalitythis is a classic story of society protecting itself from those that refuse to fall in line with the status quo brando represents the individual that has his own way of getting the job done they big brother sent him out to do the job he does it too well without adhering to the accepted standards of death and destruction am i the only one whos troubled by the fact that we have standards for death and destruction so they send the conformity police out to eliminate the individual hmmmmmmdraw any parallels between this and things you see every day with the deepest respect to mr coppola whom i believe is one of the best directors of all time i think he transcended his original intent of the movie and probably didnt even realize it until after the movie was released the subtle subtext that permeates the entire movie has way too much to it to have been planned and portrayed instead it seems to have grown itself like some wild flower in the middle of a vegetable garden again i must reiterate i think ff coppola did a bangup job on this entire production as did the cast and crew but the sum of the movie exceeds the individual efforts tenfold so if you havent seen the movie rent it watch it then watch it again and maybe a few more times and look for all the generic parallels to everyday life only then make a judgment on the quality of the film those of you that have seen it watch it again with the mindset previously described i think you may just have a whole new appreciation for the film or maybe not no matter whether you love it or hate it be sure and give credit to coppola for his masterful storytelling style,1
if this is the authors and directors idea of a slice of life they are clinically manic depressives a sad moody film at best with ubiquitously aimless and unhappy characters who negatively interact with disastrous results this film is billed as a comedy what was so funny about losing your home to an allegedly premeditated arson or the drug induced forcible rape of one of the main characters is this art imitating life jack black was mildly amusing as the mountain man weed farmer however even this segment of the film was rife with pathos what was the point of living in the middle of nowhere with an entourage if blacks character was so paranoid why was he doing acid with a group of people right out of woodstock is there no end to disconnected relationships a plot less script and scene transitions lacking any cohesiveness or logical chronology,0
this film was rather a disappointment after the very slow very intense and quite gory beginning the film begins to lose it too much plot leaves too little time for explanation and coming out of the theater i wondered what this was all about the characters remain shallow the story is not convincing at all most of it is déja vù stuff without hints of parody and there are some very cheesy parts like the young cop has to do dig up a body of course its night and it rains and he has to do it alone yawn or the manifestation of the evil being nazis plus genetic manipulation wow thats really original there are some nice bits though like the fistfight scene mountain views and some running gags but though reno and vincent cassel do what they can thats definitely not worth it 3 out of 10,0
be warned neither zetajones nor mcgregor plays the main part as the poster would have you believe their roles are in fact minorbr br the film stumbles badly between exaggerated comedy and realistic drama with neither being really engaging especially i find it impossible to muster much sympathy for the main protagonist not to mention his screwball friends and sex obsessed fiancé the plot drags terribly and i turned this one off after about 23 unusual for me as i like to finish what i start the good acting and beautiful setting takes it from 1 to 2 starsbr br 210,0

this supernatural peter weir thriller is truly one of the most haunting and fascinating movies ever seen richard chamberlain does his best performance here as the australian lawyer who defends a group of young aborigins accused of murder as he gets closer on the case he discovers more about the main defendant chris and not least about himself chris tells him that he is a mulkurul which appear to be a race of supernatural beings that lived in australia thousands of years ago at the same time extraordinary high rainfall seems to confirm the aboriginal prophecy of the coming of the last wave the one that will drown the worldbr br the dream sequences and the supernatural effects enhance this movie and make it a spectacular experience olivia hamnett and david gulpilil are solid in the supporting roles as well as the chap with the difficult name who plays charlie the old aborigin who can turn into an owl the climax and the ending dont disappoint in contrast to many other supernatural thrillers who fall flat after a promising hour or so however this can not be called a pure thriller it is a drama as well and talks about spirituality and spiritual identity in the modern world a masterful work by peter weir the master of visually stunning dramas,1

i can remember watching this for the first time when i was 9 years old i wanted to be one of the barbarian brothers this movie is still great one original aspect was that the fight scenes where very short implying that the barbarian brothers where so good that they finished there enemies off quickly plus you have chases a cage fight a dragon and yes even a bar brawl br br yes the acting is bad so thats why its not a ten also the story line has received a lot of criticism i think it is quite original not to many movies in its genre have the same original story lines or colorful dialogue br br i definitely recommend this film,1

now i had the pleasure of first viewing contaminated man when it premiered on tv back in december of 2000br br an infectious disease expert william hurt looses his family when an unknown disease enters his home and kills them now some years later he is now in russia or someplace im not sure where exactly all i know is it takes place somewhere in that area anyway because of budget cutbacks at an infectious disease laboratory they are forced to lay off most of their workers one of them a disgruntled security guard named joseph muller played peter weller best known for his role as the indestructible robocop goes in there and demands that they give him his job back he needs this job because he is divorced and he needs it to pay child support so he goes in there a fight breaks out and some things get knocked over dangerous things its soon discovered that muller has been infected with a deadly pathogen in fact its so deadly one drop of his blood will kill a person in matter of seconds soon word gets out and the disease expert hurt is called in to investigate and he later teamed up with an american reporter now muller is determined to get home to see his wife and son and will stop at nothing even if he has to infect the entire russian populationbr br now as i said before this film is a lot like falling down we have a disturbed person weller here michael douglas in falling down who will stop at nothing to accomplish there goal even if they have to kill a few people in the process next we have a herotype person hurt here robert duvall in falling down who is both sympathetic and determined to stop the antagonistbr br contaminated man is in fact a very good film with a good story line and some very good performancesbr br 810,1
the filmmakers try to paint the influence of the mondovis and robert parker as a travesty on par with the german occupation of france and the reign of fascism but they never find a victim in this film we hear wine makers critics and distributors bemoan that while the wine industry grows it becomes increasingly homogeneous but the film never makes a case that this has resulted in the loss of any good wine or exploitation of any person or culture other than naive wine spectator readers with lots of cash if they want to pay hundreds of dollars for a dull wine so be itbr br if this were a film about the diamond trade where the debeers corporations market domination results in human suffering the muckraking style might have been appropriate but as it is it just comes off as antiamerican antimodernization and anticapitalist had the filmmakers been around in the 1870s they most likely would have protested the grafting of american vines in the effort to save french wine,0

this film is famous for several qualities a literate script for once in partlyreligious filmmaking by philip dunne some very good performances a firstrate production in every department and its intelligent direction by veteran henry king if one were making a film then getting such talents as leon shamroy as cinematographer lyle wheeler as art director and alfred newman as composer of original music would guarantee a quality production add the cast of this film including gregory peck and susan hayward as the title characters james robertson justice raymond massey kieron moore jayne meadows and john sutton plus a dance by gwen verdon and expectations might be raised that the resulting film could be made into something special but in a biblical subject script usually a subgenre prone to illogical motivations and miraculous interventions everything would ultimately depend on the authors skills philip dunne here has supplied human beings a rare achievement in biblical films david is a man in this film manysided not someone doing mythical deeds on paper in the old testament gregory peck makes him curious passionate selfcontrolled selfdeprecating and appealing as bathsheba hayward is scarcely the perfect choice but conveys a good deal of commonsense earthiness and emotional normalcy that helps one see why the king of israel would risk so much for her the rest of the cast is stalwart and capable by turns the familiar storyline provides them little to work with but author dunne and the cast do as much as is possible with the human situations davids youth is told in flashback how he was chosen by a prophet of yahweh to be king of israel and earns his way to be second to the king saul by defeating goliath the phiiistine in battle when all else are afraid to beard the giant warrior thereafter he finally is driven from the court of king saul of israel becomes a famous warrior and returns to claim the kingdom and become the instrument of death of jonathan the kings son formerly a friend his wars are successful the film opens in fact with a successful attack scene but his life is empty since his wife michal jayne meadows is sauls daughter and is cold to him he turns to bathsheba whom he sees from the palace roof bathing naked later she admits she had hoped he would see her but she has a husband uriah when she becomes pregnant it becomes necessary for uriah to come in from the battlefield and spend time at home he instead asks david to set him in the forefront of the battle even after being aroused by verdons dance david agrees he is killed a war hero but this does not solve the infidelity question drought comes to israel and the kings infidelity is blamed for the phenomenon at last david places his hands on the ark of the covenant recently brought to jerusalem and housed in a temple which has caused the death of others who accidentally came in contact with it inviting his god to punish himand nothing,1

it ran 8 seasons but its first in early 1959 and its last in the autumn of 1965 were shorter than seasons 27 cbs chief william paley canceled rawhides production after watching the 1st show of season 8 in september 1965 because he disliked the series without eric fleming as gil favor who had departed after season 7 the last new episode aired in november 1965 the lone 1966 cbs broadcast on january 4 1966 was a rerun br br i have often wondered why rawhide didnt switch to color filming for its last season most of the big westerns of the 1960s had gone over to color by 1965 cbs was broadcasting in color that autumn for many of their sitcoms but westerns like gunsmoke and rawhide remained in black and white gunsmoke was the last western and last prime time network series to switch to color on september 17 1966 for the episode snap decision,1
i wish there was a category to place this in other than horror it simply isnt granted it has its horrific moments however i dont feel that makes it a horror film i will give that this movie could have been better a million little things could have been changed to make it betterbr br that having been said i love this movie im often sad that people misunderstand the whole point of it it has always been clear to me that the point of this movie was to say things arent always what they seem sometimes evil isnt br br barker was at a con i went to and he did a little talk then watch the movie thing it was very interesting many things he wished to put in the movie couldnt be and a chunk was cut out of the movie that he believed to be long lost this was a chunk that helped shed light on boone and his girlfriend as well as some other detailsbr br i know some people are bothered by not having more information about all of the breed in the background however i always felt that gave the movie a more real fleshed out feel i have read the novella this was based off of as well as many of the comics because of this the movie just always seemed like a staging ground for the whole story a much more involved story that sadly has never has a chance to live br br despite all of the flaws this movie might have i believe it has a lot to offer the monsters are wonderful very imaginative while the acting is sometimes a bit stiff there are some very quotable lines whenever i watch it i find something new keep and eye on boones chest toward the end at one point decker stabs him and shortly after boone falls on a card table he ends up with a card stuck to his chest this card stays there for a while even after lori pulls the knife out it stays there until boone casually removes it i love that that was a lovely little detail i thoughtbr br basically what i want to say is that if you are looking for a horror movie dont watch this if you believe that at times men can be more evil than anything we have ever dreamed up this is the movie for you this is a movie about how men destroy what they dont understand or fear,1

this movie has to rank with welcome to the jungle and the hitcher and dream catcher for sheer godawfulness youve got the most irritating heroine in gore history who spends most of her time sobbing and wailing and shriekingall the time in the most horrendous rest stop toilet ever put on film why she spends so much time in this ghastly bathroom from hell is never explained even when the usual killer truck driver is trying to murder her she refuses to leave the crapper when a motorcycle cop comes to her rescue the killer truck driver runs over the cops legs while the heroine just looks on instead of grabbing his gun for protection she drags the poor slob into the crapper and locks the door then the cop orders her to blow his brains out because of the pain she does sowhile wailing and sobbing and keeningand blows the back of his head off thenthe cop still alive beg her to shoot him again because hes still in pain he says this while the entire back of his head is all over the floor the sobbing wailing heroine shoots him again the movie goes on and on like this none of it making any sense the heroine is so dislikable you really want the killer to off her early on i saw this flick on the scifi channel so it didnt cost me anything to watch but still i did watch out of sheer fascination as to how a movie could end up so terribly bad,0
you see a movie titled battlespace what are you going to think space battles with cool as heck explosions and everyone shooting at each other what do you get with this movie well you do get some space battle goodness but for a great majority of the time its just stupid people wandering around doing almost nothing no one talks what is this nonsense we get a narrators and a ton of british computers but thats about it the main protagonist must be the worst one i have ever seen as she doesnt even have any dialog and sleepwalks though scenes literately some of the things happening are just stupid like they use a rocket like to go to space for basic transportation planet side why not just use one of those nifty space ships in any case the music is almost nonexistent with a few boring dull lifeless samples but the main thing you will notice is the atari sound effects the ships useyou have got to be kidding me i can also tell that the budget was low because everything looks fake which is not what you would expect from a movie especially what should be a super cool space battle movie i seriously think the budget must have been in the double digits it is so bad making you laugh more than you should at how plain bad it is i am starting to think that they paid the actors based on how much dialog they had because their is very little here if you cant tell already that is my main gripe here as i probably said that like 3 times already,0
the student of prague is an early featurelength horror drama or rather it is an autorenfilm ie an authors film this film is a member of a movement of many movements that tried to lend respectability to cinéma or just make a profit by adapting literature or theatre onto the screen fortunately the story of this book with moving pictures is good using alfred de mussets poem and a story by edgar allen poe it centres on the doppelgänger themebr br unfortunately the most cinematic this film gets is the double exposure effects to make paul wegener appear twice within scenes guido seeber was a special effects wizard for his day but hes not very good at positioning the camera or moving it film scholar leon hunt printed in early cinema space frame narrative however has made an interesting analysis on this film using framing to amplify the doubles theme characters being split by leftright nearfar and frontaldiagonal framing of characters and shots regardless the film mostly consists of extended long shots from a fixed position which is noticeably primitive worse is the lack of editing theres very little scene dissection and scenes linger none of this is unusual for 1913 but there were more advanced films in this respect around the same time including the better parts of atlantis august blom 1913 twilight of a womans soul yevgeni bauer 1913 and the short films of dw griffithbr br an expanded universal film vocabulary by 1926 would allow for a vastly superior remake furthermore the remake has a reason for the lyduschka character other than being an occasional troublemaker and spectator surrogate here the obtrusively acted gypsy lurks around seemingly with a cloak of invisibility i know their world is silent to me but i assume with their lips moving and such that their world would not be silent to them so how can lyduschka leer over others shoulders and not be noticedbr br nevertheless this is one of the most interesting early films conceptually wegener who seems to have been the primary mind behind this film in addition to playing the lead would later play the title role and codirect the golem in 1920helping to further inaugurate the supernatural thread in german silent cinémabr br note the first version i viewed was about an hour long surely not quite complete and was in poor condition with faces bleached at times and such im not sure who was the distributor ive also since seen the alpha dvd which at 41 minutes is missing footage present in the aforementioned print and also has fewer and very different title cards but is visually not as bad the repetitive score is best muted though,1
this is one of my two or three favorite stooges shorts and undoubtedly christine mcintyres best performance with the trio she is good in a number of other shorts but here she is absolutely brilliant her singing is not funny at all in fact it is downright beautiful but the plot is constructed in such a way that the singing enhances the humor rather than detracting from it we listen to mcintyre sing the entirety of voice of spring no less than three times but it never gets old partly because we dont tire of her voice and partly because it blends so well with the stooges antics the use of operatic soprano in a comedy is reminiscent of kitty carlisles role in the marx brothers a night at the opera but the singing is much more a part of the comedy here than in opera and mcintyre perhaps more in other performances than here exhibited a comedic talent of her own that carlisle never did the stooges buffoonery mcintyres singing and a wellconstructed plot combine for 5 out of 5 stars,1

wow i have seen some really bad movies in my time but this one truly takes the cake its the worst movie ive seen in the past decade no exaggerationbr br as a us army veteran of the war in afghanistan i found it nearly impossible to even finish watching this ridiculous film not because it brought back memories far from it but because there was absolutely no attempt at authenticity to be found anywhere in the film not so much as the tiniest little shred it seemed like it had been written by an 8 yearold child who got all his notions of war and soldierly behavior straight out of comic books the film was made in honduras which should have been a clue but even that cant fully explain the atrocious production values of this clichéridden piece of trashbr br i could try to list all the endless technical flaws but it would take virtually forever from the ancient unit shoulder patches which have not been seen or worn since wwii and the characters name tags like colcollins worn by the character colonel collins which was actually spelled using the reversed mirrorimage n of the russian alphabet not the us alphabet the list just goes on and on the uniforms the equipment the plot and most especially the behavior of the characters themselves every single scene was just chockfull of ridiculous flaws inaccuracies and utterly mindless clichésbr br neither the storyline itself nor the characters were the least bit credible or believable it was all laughably childish in the extreme this was obviously a movie that was meant to appeal strictly to prepubescent boys and i have little doubt that even they would find this film utterly absurdbr br in short this film has absolutely no redeeming qualities at all its a total waste of time id strongly advise anybody reading this to pass this garbage by its truly not worth wasting a single moment of your time for,0

this movie is the worst ive seen in the last 5 years it is surprising how brilliant actors like two main characters in this movie has accepted to act in such worthless peace of trash the film is rapebeating and revenge genre couple has gone to party and on the way back they hit a deer and he went out to finish it when a jeep full of bad guys comes he didnt go to their car instead he has been kicked and well beaten while she tries to run the car engine which betray her and she has been gang rapedthen somehow she is in her fathers house and one of bad guys is her neighbor so she took shotgun and wanted to kill him so stupid scenario bellow hollywood he was against that revenge but she is raped they laugh to her so she must kill them all but once inside the house she was satisfied by pushing rifles top in bad guys anus and went away while he has gone crazy and execute bad guy personally i think that director run out of money before finishing this because movie ends before they execute anyone else involved in this gangrape and beating which is not big surprise because sponsor obviously has seen this and wanted to take back his money lol this movie is not even for people who enjoy watching rape because they wont see anything they are looking for this director should be bannedit is for upsetting that this peace of trash has been made by british cinematography which i personally like and that is the reason ive watched this dont do it yourself you have better things to do that watching stupid scenario film,0

at least during its first half if it had started out with the three buddies in the navy and concentrated on the naval action scenes it would have been a much better and tighter film the second half of the film is worth it especially for the action sequences and close up shots of early 20th century ships but its like a dull toothache getting there also dont watch this film just because ginger rogers is in it she has an important role but its a small onebr br the film starts out showing three new york city buddies working the tourist trade and also in goodnatured competition for the hand of sally ginger rogers a singing candy salesgirl along the avenue world war i breaks out the three buddies seem completely indifferent to the struggle yet enlist in the navy anyways the one of the three with the least industry as a civilian bill boyd as baltimore winds up the commanding officer to the other two robert armstrong as dutch and james gleason as skeets to make matters more complex sally has fallen in love with one of the three but doesnt have the chance to tell him before the three sail off to warbr br the film is a little more interesting on board ship mainly because of the close shots we have of the ship itself and also because the chemistry among the three buddies is believable however james gleason at age 49 looks a bit long in the tooth to be a swabby especially when the sign at the enlistment office said you had to be between 17 and 35 to be eligiblebr br one real obvious flaw in the film that made me believe that everything outside the naval scenes was slapped together with minimum care is the costume design or i should say the lack of it in the scenes in new york just prior to wwi we have everyone dressed in the fashions of 1931 and everyone driving the cars of 1931 no effort was taken to bring this film into periodbr br in conclusion if you watch the few scenes with ginger rogers in them and the last 45 minutes involving the naval suicide mission youve seen everything here worth seeing the rest is padding,0
despite its rather salacious title this is a light teen dramedy unless youre an old coot youll probably find it likeable it isnt so good on developing characters or situations smoothly though when you view it you get the feeling that youve been running back and forth to the kitchen even if youve been sitting down watching the whole time this is one of those films that counts a great deal on your liking the characters and they are appealing enough jennifer connelly is the heartthrob of many i know but ive always liked the more obscure maddie corman the teens get most of the screen time without a lot of intrusions from those pesky grownups is it just me or did most of the young males look an awful lot alike,1
the sentinel is one of the best horror movies already made in the movies industry i think it is very scary as very few movies actually are alison parker is a model with some fame she dates a lawyer called michael lerman and has as a best friend another model called jennifer everything was great in her life until she decides to live alone for some time and rents a beautiful and old apartmentbr br the problem are her neighbors who are very very strange suddenly alison starts to have health problems and faints with frequency she also remembers some painful facts about her past that makes her have nightmares or illusions but everything has a reason and it has to do with the new house she is livingbr br i personally find the sentinel a very creepy movie and along with the exorcist they are two of the scariest movies i already watched when we discover that alisons house is only occupied by the priest and herself my blood froze its also horrible to see that she needs to become blind in the end of the movie in order to be the new sentinel to keep the monsters away from our world,1
i first see this film almost 21 years ago when it was an itv before the days of cable and satellite matinée i was off school with the mumps and i was totally wrapped in the film i have had it on bought video for about 10 years and i want to obtain a dvd copy of it david niven is my all time favourite actor and i think it is a travesty that he was over looked so many times when the oscars came around i also think that the queen should have knighted him as he easily did as much for the movie industry if not more than sean connery or anthony hopkins the way the film switches from black and white to colour and back again is well done and the film has such stellar actors as roger livesy marius goring and an early appearance from richard attenborough,1

ive seen this movie after watching paltrows version ive found that one a very good one and i thought this would not be as good but i was wrong british version was far better and enjoyable i found jeremy northam more agreeable than mark strong but i can say that strong catches much better austens knightley anyway both versions are goodbut anyone that loved austens books should watch this movie i agree with caalling andrew davies changed a few things but still remains faithful to the originalbr br 10 out of 10br br my 2 cents,1
this is a simple tale but it feels very manipulative it lacks pathos for it does not leave a room for imagination or a personal thought or time for reflectionbr br the animation is well done but i feel like it is too presentational i would have preferred more images from behind more space in the background and maybe then this would not feel so kitsch to mebr br but for a hollywood style film it works ok but it is very derivative of aardman films and this is bothering to me perhaps a longer film will test if this maker can do without the voiceoverbr br i think the voice over is too glib,0
the odd couple is one of those movies that far surpasses its reputation people all know it they hum the theme song they complain of living with a sloppy oscar or a fastidious felixbut theyre underselling the film without knowing it this isnt just about a neat guy living with a sloppy guy its a portrait of two friends helping each other through the agony of divorce its also damn funny from start to finish but its the kind of comedy that arises from realistic stressful and just plain awful situations so some viewers have actually found the film to be a bit uncomfortable but i think its verisimilitude is its strength besides matthaus bulldog face just cracks me up my favorite comedy by a country mile,1
the beginning of this movie was good it started to get really dumb after he told the people he wanted to kill himself i think if i came from a little town like that i would be offended after seeing this movie they made a lot of these people look dumb and crazy how could these people have so little to do that they follow him around all day a lot of times these people were telling him ways to kill himself like they were urging him to do it how can so many people have little respect for other people i also think they could have made a much better ending for this movie there were some good parts to this movie also some people might like it but i wouldnt recommend this to anyone,0
there is part of one sequence where some water rushes into the sunken plane everything else that happens in this movie is stock footage for airport 77 you can even make out jack lemmon and christopher lee in some of the shots a total rip off well almost by definition there may be more stock footage in this film than in plan 9 from outer spacebr br all the new material actors sitting around in an airplane set talking is bland and terrible on every level dennis weaver is totally wasted in a career low movie though thats true for everyone other than this films director fred olen ray who uses one of this many necessary fake names in order to keep workingbr br there is a level of scant professionalism that makes this film such a waste of time it would actually be better if shot by someone with no technical knowledge at all because ray has just enough knowledge about how to put together a scene in the worst old school tv fashion that this film like most of his films is totally devoid of life the worst kind of hack work the worst kind of film boringbr br this type of film is a waste of money an affair where the crew on all levels are ghosts hoping to get whatever scant pay check they can and that no one will see or know they appeared participated in this rip off there are so many people who want to make movies its disgusting to see ray burn up the money given to do nothing more but fill timebr br his commentary track is interesting in that he has to start it by explaining that he is really fred ray as he isnt credited on the film itself that tricked me into seeing it dont let it trick you,0
this really doesnt match up to castle of cagliostro lupin isnt as funny or wacky or as hyperactive the scenery and music are uninspired and plot just isnt interesting br br the only good thing about this un is the nudity only in the uncut version provided by fujiko it helped spice up some of the tedious scenes coc had a formidable villain and set up the movie for some imaginative setpieces the locations in tsotg are not very vivid or engaging br br zenigata goemon and jigen dont even provide decent sideshow entertainment this time its like they were just filling a contractual obligation by appearing br br the dvd is in fullframe with dolby stereo sound it has a decent amount of extras including quite a few trailers but one curious thing there is no chapter selection on the disc or timecode displayed on the player once inserted though you can still skip to the next scene number using the remote,0

why watch this there is only one reason and that is for the greatness of john saxon i love his acting my most favorite appearances by him are in nightmare on elm street 13 and 7 as nancys father a cop black christmas as a cop and from dusk till dawn again as a cop when i was rummaging through my local mall video outlet i came across the film zombie death house and i quickly tossed it back but before moving on i noticed that john saxon was not only an actor in this film but for the first time that i have ever heard of a director this intrigued me also the cheap 900 price tag and i and i had to have it upon coming home i realized that this film did not live up to saxons other work even his acting which may have been muddled by the added pressures of directing but it was not just him the other actors sucked too it seemed as if they had all been pulled out of a recent porno shoot and told now guys you really have to act the film even looks of 80s porn quality i cannot in good faith recommend this film to casual viewers but if you are an obsessed fan of the 80s who missed out on the culture that came from that era by being born to late or a fan of crap films than this one is for also if you dig john saxon as i do,0
arthur has always been a personal film for me for two reasons a good friend of mine who worked on the film as an extra and to help out with the horses during the stable scene just recently passed away if you look fast you can see frank graham during the restaurant scene in the background while dudley moore and jill eikenberry are in conversation frank was a champion equestrian and will be missed by all who knew himbr br secondly though i actually knew a real life arthur bach he was not quite as wealthy as arthur but spent 47 years of his life basically as a kid his parents tightly controlled his purse strings but his rent and utilities were paid for in a basement apartment in greenwich village he spent a good deal of his time getting himself intoxicated on various spirits and making a public spectacle of himself just like dudley moore does br br the wonder with arthur is why anyone would bother with him wealth of not but thats the other half of the equation my friend was a most charming person when you got to know him in fact it was almost a compulsion to be charming he couldnt buy a newspaper or magazine without trying to establish some level of relationship with the vendor he spent his life being a perfect party guest the term wastrel which was in common use in the 19th century would apply to himbr br and thats what dudley moore is a wastrel unlike my friend moore has john gielgud to clean up after him thats a full time job as we see demonstrated in arthur my friend also never found a liza minnelli a male liza minnelli in fact because he was gay still moores portrayal of arthur bach is deadly accurate and so real for mebr br arthur 20th century wastrel is being forced to marry another trust fund baby in jill eikenberry since he wont work for a living the threat of being cut off is quite real for him he only has his butler hobson played by john gielgud and chauffeur bitterman played by ted post to pour his troubles out to we should all have such troublesbr br john gielgud in his nearly century of life certainly did better work than in arthur on film and in fact gielgud is more prominently known for his stage performances yet 1981 was a year of sentiment at oscar time the academy gave henry fonda and katharine hepburn oscars for on golden pond and gielgud the best supporting actor award essentially for the work of a lifetime that man was amazing still at his craft almost to the endbr br so to frank graham who worked in the film and to jackie weiss a genuine real life arthur i dedicate this review,1
i have always been a fan of bottom grabbing as many videos as i could find of the series here in the states the chemistry between rik and ade is always genius and the combination of smart writing and utterly stupid humor seems to work without fail i thus sat down to watch this movie with great eagerness and was utterly disappointed by the endbr br the first 34 of the movie can best be described as uninspired and poorly directed sorry ade but with some utterly brilliant moments unfortunately these laughoutloud moments make you realize how lessthanbrilliant the rest of the movie is the slapstick starts off funny but eventually becomes a bit boring with only the perverted sex jokes to keep things humorousbr br the end of the movie the green scenes for those of you whove seen it was perhaps the worst ending ive seen in the past decade honestly it was one joke repeated about thirty times followed by an abrupt ending that made no sense which didnt bother me and wasnt funny which didbr br to sum up i was sorely disappointed by this movie i shall cling to the few brilliant moments in it to retain the fondest memories that i can but i have to warn you if youre about to overpay for your ntsc conversion tape from the local importer dont there are far better things to spend your money on,0
this film is definitely up there with the worst films ive ever seen probably in my top 5 of worst films i laughed once and that was whenbr br evan im building something evans secretary i hope its a barber shopbr br that was literally the only time i laughed in this comedy awful compared to bruce almighty which as a big jim carrey fanwasnt even that great br br this movie lacked the humour of having gods powers and was more about family bonding id class it solely as a family movie definitely not a family comedy br br seeing a bird poo on someones shirt is not hilarious neither is a beard that grows back instantbr br i didnt even think the special effects were great the animals looked really stuck on it was like watching a film which hadnt been glued together properlybr br 210 film avoid,0
this movie needs to be put on dvd it was so funny and i loved it really really cute and funny not realistic but not suppose to be the only thing i did not like about it was the girl relying on the guy too much it represents the time period way of thinking though i have been trying to get this movie for so long and it has been unavailable for us format only in the uk and will not play on us dvd players it is sadly an over looked classic film believe it or not but this film could easily become a cult favorite for all ages too bad we do not legalize certain things that could really save small countries or our own lindy is unsinkable a positive character that makes lemonade out of lemons she is funny and charming she stole the show,1
the first one was different and funny this attempt should have never left the studio this movie does not make you laugh it is a weak attempt at gross out humor the movie picks out current and old movies to ripoff this time the jokes seem used and overdone the audience that i saw it with only reacted to hannibal dinner scene and was otherwise asleep,0
perfect movies are rare even my favorite films tend to have flaws rear window looks a little stagey at times chris elliots character in groundhog day doesnt work the music score in best years of our lives is too cheesy the beginning of nights of cabiria is a little too slow but this film is perfectly executed from start to finish br br the script is brilliant the acting is superb all around although reese witherspoon and sam waterston are amazing the whole cast shines the directing and the photography are inspired and the music score is touching without being intrusive like some miramax scores that are too manipulative every sad moment is truly moving every light moment makes me smile this truly is one of the best films i have ever seen and i wish there were more films like it br br i am glad that reese witherspoon has gone on to stardom after this film but i am sorry to see that her recent movies are so much more escapist and silly than this serious film which is about real people real feelings and real problems brilliant a mustsee,1
the railway children was on tv again this weekend and i had forgotten how good it wasbr br if i have a criticism it is that the episodic structure sometimes shows a little too clearly there being little narrative flow from sequence to sequence the charm and beauty of the film are such that this matters very little howeverbr br i wont revisit the comments of others other than to add my vote for the final scene on the platform as being possibly the single most emotional scene in the history of british cinema as a cynical old git passing through middle age rather too quickly i too find i cannot even think of that moment without being hit with a severe case of ive got something in my eye in fact its not just something in my eye it moves things around inside me too with that beautiful happy pain we sometimes feelbr br and jenny agutter was exquisitely beautiful in this film standing with one foot in childhood and one in young womanhood and bringing qualities of both to her portrayal of a girl having to grow up rather too quicklybr br plus a quick plaudit for bernard cribbins regarded mostly as a lightweight actor he deftly created a perks of great humanity,1
it stars war correspondent william holden separated who falls in love with a stunning eurasian doctor jessica jones set against the stunning backdrop of hong kong the cinematography is magnificent as they rendezvous on a hill overlooking hong kong the story deals with racial tensions society frowning on mixed relations and extra marital affairs but what i love about it is the strong character of the heroine portrayed by jessica jones who is a eurasian doctor who stays humble and steadfast in her altruistic mission and stays loyal to her love despite that she gets sacked at her hospital for cavorting with a married man by gossipping high rankers one day william holden is called to the korean war which he covers and then that ill fated day she gets the news of his demise the end of course is tragic i cried when she went to their hill it was a very sweet ill fated love affair it defeats all the odds the fact that she got fired from her job how his wife would not grant him a divorce yet their great love perseveredthey experienced a great love despite it all i personally do not believe in extramarital affairs and think he should have not started something when he was bound to someone else and she should not have allowed herself to let it happen but despite that a truly magnificent movie i think the heroine overshadowed the hero jessica jones is sultry and gave a magnificent performance although i thought it strange they didnt not hire a real asian actress or someone with asian blood i agree with one review jessica jones oozes sexuality when she lays on the ground and looks up at william holden speaking calmly but her eyes say come take me nowbr br i find it a pity most great films were made before i was born it seems many hollywood movies are lacking in depth great acting and depend entirely on stunts and heavy sex scenes this is truly one of the greatest illfated love stories in movies,1
sure it may not be a classic but its one full of classic lines one of the few movies my friends and i quote from all the time and this is fifteen years later maybe it was on cinemax one too many times michael keaton is actually the worst actor in this moviehe cant seem to figure out how to play it but hes surrounded by a fantastic cast who know exactly how to play this spoof looking for a movie to cheer you up this is it but rent it with friendsitll make it even better,1
codirected by and starring rutger hauer this film short was based on a short story by dutch writer harry murlischbr br in the 10 minutes of the films length you will get to see a lifetime as harry unravels his longtime fascination with a room he passes constantly in his youth returning to the city many years later he finds he has rented the same roombr br using black and white film the textures are accentuated in this delicate telling of a tale the voice of harry drawing you into his worldbr br a subtle tight performance from rutger hauer and 2 nonspeaking characters wonderful soundtrack by dutch musician dyzackbr br at the moment difficult to see this movie as it is only available on dvd region 2 linfidele liv ullman as a bonus track but is due to be on the rereleased dvd of the hitcher another tight but very different performance from hauerbr br see this film if you can,1
well after seeing beginning i thought why the hell they burned schraders version and did that poor one but now after seeing dominion i deeply understand this decision even they got it not much betterbr br sorry but this movie is really crap some good moments but a really boring storytelling and some major plotholes are killing this moviebr br i thing the exorciststory has a lot and in a prequel on this you can built on a lot and give references the audience will like to see but there is so much little of it in the movie the effects are really bad not even tvstandard,0
i first saw this movie in the mid 80s and thought it was a funny movie as i have gotten older i watch this movie for different reasons i like to view it when im feeling sadnostalgic for my lost youth i was a teenager 14 at the time of the release of this film so i can identify with many of the same problemsdilemmas that the camperscits in this movie have i enjoy seeing the clothes that were worn at this time and hearing the same old urban legends such as was told on the overnight canoe trip the film is also full of funny one liners i highly recommend this movie to anyone that was a teenager in the late 70s to early 80s,1
in 1943 a group of raf officers including eric wiiliams decide to escape from a pow camp using a gymnastic vaulting horse in the courtyard in 1950 it was decided to film his account and it kickstarted a peculiar british film genre the military prison camp story that reached its apogee in danger within 1959br br the wooden horse is one of the quietest films i have ever watched there are no great dramatic moments but a steady storyline eventually builds to a climax that has more tension because the story doesnt give way for unlikely drama jump cuts or jacked up somethings about to happen music it is utterly of its time and works beautifullybr br leo glenn anthony steel and david tomlinson lead a curiously low key cast of extras and i suspect nonactors without exception all are constantly monotonal and quiet they keep emotion out of their roles as so many were until recently exservice i suspect they recreated their war time roles as officers and gentlemenbr br this unemotional approach does not detract from any dramatic tension on the contrary unlike most wartime escape films the story doesnt end at the barbed wire and that fact alone keeps me glued to the end,1
back in 2004 i saw true tom tykwers contribution to paris je taime when i saw it i loved it and became thrilled it became my favorite short film and made me appreciate the format so much of course i wanted to watch the whole film and i would even check who was attached etcbr br yesterday i finally saw it courtesy of the internetbr br first of all i must say that it looks awesome the photography is beautiful in every short and shot at the worst being nothing special but still brilliant and clear later i read the trivia here and maybe its how scanning in 6k gives more justice to all the dps work my special favorites are the quais de seine first scene that sunlight the sin cityesquire but better for me quartier de la madeleine and 14th arrondisement but you know what the hell i like them all true or faubourg saintdenis still makes me nervous with those brilliant colours my eyes they tremble and quartier latin is gold imprisoned on silver beautifulbr br yes these are some beautiful short filmsbr br now lets get onto the content i very much and i mean very much like the eclecticism that is so successfully felt you never have have the same themes or treatment between two shorts and i think the formula is restrictive enough to let all these artists explore beautiful and deepening things inside the shorts i loved coming from a simple love story into a crazychinesemusicalinpariswithbarbetschroeder into a social commentary into a terror comedy into a humble monologue i love surprises and this film has them its great they took a chance to let all these directors flesh out things that are not usual in mainstream cinema which i have come to heavily despise its not heavily experimental but i can breath the breathing space these people hadbr br i like the small time and i love the acting i love the simplicity and i love the love i like the simple feelings and the beauty and the eclecticism and in general its a film that is very very very nice to see alone or with someone to simply feel it left me feeling very goodbr br there is something about the earnestness in it its so frankbr br what i didnt like well for me there are two shorts that arent exactly the best quais de seine which is good natured sure and maybe even necessary but feels too much like a commercial and pèrelachaise that even though i love the acting i felt its themes were forced but that of course is just me tour eiffel i also didnt love but i think is probably because of my very different sensibility from that of sylvain chomet i dont know if this film has a special interest for people who already know the actors and directors and so they can delight in their interaction in the surprises look out for alexander payne in a funny role and basically in what will this director do,1
just so that you fellow movie fans get the point about this film i decided to write another review i missed a few things out last timebr br first the script second the acting third jesus christ what were they thinking making a piece of garbage like this and then expecting us to enjoy it when there are no redeeming features whatsoever from beginning to end except when joseph fiennes finally gets blown away in a very unexciting climaxbr br i cant believe i wasted my money on this when i could have given it to a homeless person or a busker or somethingbr br are you getting the picture,0
this is a gripping story that borrows elements from the kennedy assassination and uses them successfully to create an excellent western talebr br the movie has a good music score though it relies on repeating the title theme a little too much giuliano gemma and the rest of the cast are superb this is a more cerebral than usual spaghetti western that relies more on story than action and it succeeds because the story is excellent this is not to say that there is no action in the movie there is plenty and it is very well crafted this movie pulls you in right away and keeps you absorbed til the end youll always be wondering whats in those documents everyones after it also has some biting commentary on american politicsbr br this movie shows why valerii in my opinion is in a three way tie with sollima and corbucci for second place in the rankings of spaghetti western directors,1
thomas ince always had a knack for bringing simple homespun stories to life with fullness and flair the italian is such a film solid acting particularly by george beban father of silent child actor george beban jr and wonderful sets convey a realistic feeling of early immigrant tenements in new york these give this 1915 film an authenticity which is unusual in features of this vintagebr br the film begins with the modern day and a man george beban in modern clothes reading a story about an italian immigrant and then we transition into the story with george playing the immigrant he raises enough money to bring his fiancée from italy to america marries her and has a son with her but times are hard and the family struggles to survive i found myself wondering why the mother didnt breastfeed her child and avoid the complications with the dirty formula but oh well even the early dream factory was pushing political correct behaviour for women in 1915br br the best scene in the picture is when beban has a chance to seek revenge on a crime boss who inadvertently put him in jail and at the last minute he decides against his planned course of action very neat i loved the curtain effect it was great wonderful use of lighting in this filmbr br i give the italian an 8 out of 10,1
after some quite ok dutch action flicks like lek and van god los gerrard verhage wants to make a movie about the life of a dutch mobster well mobster is a big word for klaas bruinsma he isnt a real international big guy like george jung blow or pablo escobar he is just an amsterdam lowlife who made some money by selling softdrugs things are often blown up in the netherlands and this movie is just an other example but even then the movie could be very nice if the story was okay told now there are major jumps in time one day klaas is just an ordinary drugboy the next shot he seems to be a big player in the drugscene nobody knows hows that possible except for those who read the book the acting is really bad the nondutch moviewatchers get to see one of the worst actresses in the netherlands chantal janzen when you think she finally gets naked then you are watching a stand in model so bad acting bad montage crap story de domineebr br please dont watch it even if other people say its good because it isnt ive warned you,0
it brings to mind the writings of stephen king and the remembered childhoods filled with terror from stories like it as the exact opposite there is no terror in these childhoods that any of the friends who are still friends 20 years up the line remember or seem to suffer from up the line all is described as friendly jostling maybe periodically described as picking on one or more of them but all is forgiven there is no angst embedded as the film and the participants in later life describe the relationships all we see are young people having grown up to be basically the same persons more mature but basically still the same people and the same power structuresbr br totally amazing not just for the fact that people can in fact grow up relatively unharmed by social conventions but also that friendships can in fact last in this respect this movie is a tiny pearl as one assumes this has been the intent of the film a portrait of unforced emotions binding people together which when seen in opposition to films of later years portraying the dark sides of childhood the violent inhibitions in bowling for combine is what easily springs to mind but since mid 80ies along with the growing adoration of children and childhood accompanied by 1000s of commercials animations and series directed straight at children several movies and documentaries have had success with portraying the dark sides of growing up the abuse the loneliness the push to excel resulting in adults with dark and twisted mindsbr br and here comes a film that says it is possible to have a happy childhood lookaherebr br thank you for that or the counterweight illusion br br 810,1
tashan the title itself explains the nature of the moviebr br this type of movies are actually made for flop what a shame that yash raj films produces such movies those are worthless than cgrade movies or even some cgrade movies have better and pleasing story than tashan the much hyped and overconfidently promoted tashan poorly bombed at the boxoffice which it certainly deservedbr br in my view this is the worst movie ever made from honourable yash raj films banner how come they handled such a heavy project to new vijay krishna acharya who has no actual sense of making action flick he tried to imitate sanjay gadhvis ways of making like dhoom but he suffered at last the action scenes are more like than comics or cartoon movies made for exhausting the audiencesbr br the story also loses in its meaning and substances to tenderly win the audiences hearts in most scenes anil kapoor reminds me of southern tamil star rajnikant in his body languages and wordly expressions i am not a fan of neither saif nor akshay but the award of kareena should have finally gone to saifs hand instead of akshay just from the starting point i expected of it but at the end it displeased me with the climax truth saif is the main behind the whole adventure while akshay joins in the midst in any movie the final should be judged with the whole characters of the entire story and the award or say reward should be given to the one who deserves credit and tashan loses in this way and unexpectedly failed to become a hitbr br akshays has nothing new to show off his comedian talent here but still reminds of his previous movies he seriously need to form a new image to his fans that would impress them again and again in between saif did a great job in race and now he returned again in his hilarious nature through this movie but he has fully developed himself in the acting field and last but not the least about kareena she looks really hot with bikini dress of which some complain as she became too lean but i myself dont think so instead she became slim yes slim it is a good factor for a female to attract the major people or say male beside them it is nice that saifs son ibrahim appears in the beginning last as young saif i hope now he too will lean forward in target of making acting as his careerbr br those who like this tashan they are either mentally immatured or still want to go back to childhood or say want to be admitted in an asylum thumbs down to debutante director vijay krishna acharya who mishandled the project offered by yash raj films in future he should experiment and study the script minimum of 5 years before going into practical directionsbr br sorry i dont like to rate good stars to this type of junk movies,0
this is about some vampires who can run around out in the sunlight that are causing some problems down in south america casper van dien is sent in with his team of commandos to investigate the movie opens with van dien co walking through the jungle and theres this huge black guy who just absolutely positively cannot act he speaks all his lines as if hes reading them off the cuecards for the very first time his voice is also so low that well its positively hilarious great way to get the movie started anyhow they run into some of our vampires shoot them this causes them to appear to die for about 20 seconds and then of course they come back to life van dien notices that one of them was impaled across a tree limb and yells to his buddies to kill them with wood the stunt work must be seen to be believed the vampires are on wires that pull them up trees which is supposed to make them look like they can climb really easily but it just makes them look like theyre bouncing around on bungee cords or somethingbr br yeahanyhow later on the huge black dude is down in south america with some guys van dien not included and theyre attacked by more vampires its really too bad these guys never heard of a crossbow because it would seem to be the perfect weapon to kill the little bloodsuckers with but instead they use big old wooden stakes that they try to impale the vampires with by hand the big black dude ends up getting captured and he eventually becomes some big powerful vampire leader van dien ends up battling him later on it doesnt help that all through the movie everyone forgets that if you shoot a vampire they are knocked out for 20 seconds or so which would enable a person to stick a stake in them fairly easily they just try to stick stakes in them in the middle of handtohand combat yeah not exactly brilliant tacticsbr br theres a hot babe remember veronica from the lost world tv show yes its her who also happens to be walking around in the middle of vampire county on some sort of research mission and she also just happens to be van diens exwife hey what are the odds its a shame shes not in the movie a whole lot more than she is will her and casper get back together in the end will van dien defeat the huge black dude who cant act will the circus performer vampires make you laugh through all the numerous action scenes will we hear the three stooges music when somebody does something funny has even lynda carter forgotten how to act in her small cameo shes more convincing in her sleep number bed commercials these questions and more will will be answered if you make it all the way to the end of the moviebr br i dont know it might score some points on the so,0

the earlier part of the film was rather enjoyable but towards the end it became trite although turturro is an actor i generally like his luzhin often resembled a bad rain man impression and the portrayal of the genius as a semiautistic man was annoying overall it seems as if this film is trying to hard and ends up looking pompous in spite of mostly fine performances,0
this is just typical bruce willis action movie schtick watch it with some popcorn and your buddies rent it to save moneybr br none of it is realistic the battles arent realistic the soldiers arent realistic the victims arent realistic and why was tom skerritts character talking to willis from the deck of the carrier whats up with that he cant do that from inside the shipbr br of course bruce w gets a machete wound theres a bunch of average explosionsbr br if this movie accurately represents the navy seals then dont get stuck in africa expecting them to come rescue youbr br the noble attack on the village bothered me the most front row seats to an ethnic cleansingas bruce looks at the slaughter going on in town so what does he do he crawls into town on his belly yep how many died while they were putzing around oh wella body count was needed i guessbr br and if that one african guy was so important why didnt he get on the chopper with the elderly and children can he say duh br br finally the movie was very dark not just in plot but so much happens at night it was difficult to make out what was going onbr br rent it,0
the movie was completely misleading and the bonus material confirmed my impression that it was a ripoff of joeseph conrads heart of darkness the river is replaced by a road and the boat becomes a jeep and walter kurtz is osamabr br the claims made on the outside of the dvd box was overt fraud tobr br take this fabricated death of a journalist and present it as factualbr br while some portions have muslims supporting the 911 attacks for the usas treatment of muslims around the world br br i alerted the video store that the movie should be removed from their documentary section and be placed in the wardrama area for quasi fictional accounts of actual events,0
this is a hardboiled warner brothers film starring a very young barbara stanwyck a consummate master at portraying machiavellian cool a technique she perfected eleven years later in billy wilders double indemnity stanwyck plays lily powers the wellworn daughter of a violent speakeasy owner in a suffocating steeltown she has been rendered cynical and numb by years of being offered up as a sexual favor to her fathers customers once her father dies in a distillery explosion she hops a freight train to new york and literally sleeps her way up the corporate ladder of a bankbr br this would come across as preposterous were it not for stanwycks blazing work here with her deadeyed stare and amoral seduction methods it is easy to see why men become addicted to her aggressive carnality one of the young men she seduces along the way is a freshfaced john wayne as of all things an accountant named jimmy mccoy the melodrama gets heavyhanded toward the last third of the film with a murdersuicide a hushhush job in paris to keep lily quiet and the new bank president who is so addicted to lily that he embezzles company funds to keep her in luxury a tackedon ending is somewhat disappointing but not before stanwyck sears the screen the film has curious touches like lilys bonding friendship with an africanamerican woman named chico and the german immigrant who teaches lily about nietzsche philosophy regarding the importance of avoiding sentimentality,1
superb silent version of the story of francois villon although remade in the thirties as if i were king with frank lloyd directing preston sturges scripting and ronald colman starring this version is even better barrymore with a cohort of comedians plays the comic fool and the winedepressed villon with a verve that colman could not match the photography is startling in its beauty and innovation and the supporting cast particularly conrad veidt in his american premiere the incredibly beautiful marceline day and the supporting comics slim summerville and hank mann steal every scene they are inbr br it is a shame that barrymore did so few firstrate comedies among his sound films only his lead in twentieth century and his supporting role in midnight can compare to this and those stand up only because of his superb voice in this silent movie barrymore must tell his tale without benefit of words and he does so alternately hilariously unrecognizable as the king of the fools and tenderly as villon in love he even gets to leap around in the swashbuckling style of fairbanks most convincingly he also lets his supporting cast have their share of glory capering in this ensemble work like any talented comic of the erabr br finally a brief word about alan crosland a director known today only for directing the first talking feature the jazz singer in the same year this was released crosland was a careful innovative delightfully original director and it is a shame that more of his works are not known perhaps this movie far more interesting as a movie than his bestknown work will be your introduction to his other talents if so you could do far worse,1
it was a saturday night and a movie called baseketball was on tv i had always wanted to watch it but never got around to it when it was in the cinema boy was i mistaken words cannot describe how funny this film is starring the creators of south park who share a natural on screen chemistry when being funny i taped the replay the next day and exactly one week after watching it for the first time i have seen it 7 times im obsessed with it and i know anyone who appreciates trey and matts work will appreciate this movie a must see this is my 1 comedy of all time,1
this movie i would like to say was completely great i can see how many people would think that its just a shocker film this isnt completely untrue but its as much of shocker fiction as chuck palahniuks books are one of my favorite movies of all time bijo no harawata is a certain type of crudely made movie that you can have just about any reaction to its scary funny silly gross full of offthetop material and to some people arousing the fist time i saw this it was with my friend and his mother had brought it home for him to see it he said it was just some screwed up japanese movie but i saw so much more of it its badly made yes but it has a certain type of poignancy as to be beautiful too as the director says himself this is a shocker movie made for a certain reason its like atrophy if you leave audiences soft then the entire human race is going to be soft i think this is a good philosophy and i agree with it onehundred percent bijo no harawata is the type of movie that gang rapes the hell out of fitness yogurt and all of this newwave stuff,1
this movie is most possibly the worst movie i have ever see in my entire life the plot is ridiculous and the whole little man crap is just so stupid the entire movie is unrealistic and dumb lets face it its just a black comedy this is just a pointless horrible piece that should have never made it to theaters the jokes are not funny and the acting is horrendous please i beg of to you save your money than see this worthless piece of crap i had to endure sitting through little man for an hour and a half wishing my eyes would bleed i am disgusted that something like this would even be thought of who writes this crap the actors have no talent what so ever how do these people get into hollywood they are making money off this junk,0
if this is supposed to be the black experience let me out at either the front or back doorbr br a mamas boy one day sees 2 young hoods walk by and from then on its all down hill for him angela bassett the one shining grace in this film plays his over protective religious mother despite her anger at how his life has turned by the middle of the picture she really decides to accept this she allows his friends to come in and suddenly its all right to use the profanity as long as its not in front of the childrenbr br this is a sad state of affairs regarding gangster rap you knew where this film was headingbr br i literally laughed out loud when at the end when bassett is accompanying her sons body for burial she states that while his life had been cut short at age 24 he had become a man what man he had been a convicted criminal wrote the most atrocious rap music with constant vulgarityand scorned society that scene in the classroom where he tells a teacher that as a sanitation worker he will earn more than the teacher is a perfect example of what goes on in our schools the complete and utter lack of respect for the teacherbr br the east coast west coast gang rap rivalry is never fully explained all we see are guns blazingbr br a terrible picture doing nothing to prevent gang violence what horrible role models are these rap singers and their foul music the african american community should take umbrage at their very being who was this classless fat slob who portrayed biggie he made rerun from the old television show look thin by comparison i know it was the streets of bedford stuyvesant that changed this chubby little boy into the vulgar monster that he was what a sorry state of affairs when this is called motion picture entertainment,0
i dont remember when i first heard about this movie but i rented it about six years ago and it still remains one of my favorite comedies i will admit you probably will despise this movie if you know nothing about rap music but if you are a rap fan even a casual one you will love the inside jokes and references one of the best lines in the movie is about the difference between a b and a h i still use this line today and get lots of laughs with it one of the best performances comes from larry scott who played nerd lamar in revenge of the nerds it is unfortunate that this movie will likely never get a dvd release,1
in this sendup of horror films 50s cold war paranoia reaganera america and high school films adam arkin plays tony the star quarterback of full moon high in the 1950s he and his father ed mcmahon travel to communist romania and while hes lost in the streets one night he is bitten by a werewolf when he returns stateside he cannot control his animalistic urges and goes on a killing spree frustrated he flees town decades later the immortal tony returns to town and reenrolls in highschool he still cant control his transformations and the townspeople and his friends realize hes not quite human it all culminates during the schools big football gamebr br i expected this to be one of those so bad its good films from the early 80s but i was surprised that the film was actually legitimately funny the cast including kenneth mars as a pervy coach roz kelly as tonys lusty former flame demond wilson as a bus driver and alan arkin as a oddball doctor go all out with hilarious resultsbr br while watching this film i was struck by how similar the writing and humor were to family guy full moon high has that same anything goes attitude and never takes itself seriously,1
honestly i am not even joking when i say that this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen this film dosent have a single ounce of originality in its flimsy dialog or its blatantly plagiarized story line i can not even begin to count the number of things in this film that are obviously ripped off from the omen and other movies like it for example the nanny lucy in this film is actually one of the devils minions sent to guide and protect the spawn of satandoes this sound a lot like mrs baylock to anyone else another thing is that the orphanage were they first got the child burned to the ground just a few months after he was adopted just like in the omen however luckily one priest survived the blaze and escaped with sever burns all over his bodyyet another coincidence and to top it all off the burned priest is staying in a hospital room with pictures of jesus all over the walls much like the priest in the omen having pages of the bible plastered on the walls like wallpaper please dont even get me started drawing comparisons between the ending of this movie and the omen for you because as ive stated above there are far too many to mention here,0
shakespeares plays have a way of transcending time the language somehow breaks the time barrier but perhaps it is the actors who really do thatbr br after the disappointment in romeo and juliet the version with claire danes and leonardo dicaprio was hesitant take on another modern rendition of shakespeare to my surprise othello was greatbr br iagos character was played so well by the kenneth fellow even thoough iago is really evil and despicable the character was played so well that it does what shakespeare intended for the charater to be a pleasure for the audience to hate i have to say that fishburnes performance here was really good as wellbr br i recommend this for shakespeare scholars and lazy students who refuse to read the book alike,1
i saw this superb documentary at the santa barbara intl film festival it is extremely absorbing and very well crafted drawing you into the life and career of harry nilsson one of the most overlooked musical talents of the 1960s and 70s while i was familiar with his better known compositions one is the loneliest number without you i learned about this mans brilliant writing and beautiful singing if you love music youll find plenty to draw you in to his world which unfortunately spiraled out of control as his success increased and his past haunted him however sad he nonetheless was completely devoted to his family and you will find yourself so glad to have met this man the profile is effectively told through nilssons own words and those of his friends and colleagues a virtual whos who of rockwho loved and respected him dont miss this,1
first i am a big fan of alien and alien ii in my opinion both of these movies created and defined the sifi horror genre as we know it today i noticed lifeforce was often compared to the aliens saga after viewing this movie i would highly disagree there are some okay special effects with the alien vampires and the story line might have been acceptable i just cant get past a naked woman space vampire throughout the whole movie this is absolutely absurd although she does look good add in a bunch of bad british acting and its pretty much over most of the movie ends up taking place in london or somewhere in england so after the first 20 minutes you lose the outerspace setting and any hope of some real sifi horror action and suspensebr br,0
to all the reviewers on this page i would have to say this movie is worth seeing so it was made in 1972 so what the fashion in the movie was exactly the same fashion of its time people who didnt study culture of the decades would think that this movie is a cheese ball compared to the modern series left behind which is made for our time right now it does look cheezy however the only cheezy part of the movie is the fashion which again was over 30 years in the past but the message that is sent in this film is very powerful and carefully preserved there is just so much to say but i refuse to say it for fear of spoiling it so go out and see this film if you dont like the message that it sends then you have issues that need some attention,1
