worldnews,why try to fix it do you have to be promised a reward to do the right thing if so youre immoral to begin with and we dont have time for that there are degrees of fucked we might survive a bit longer or with more people if we make more of an effort now what we should be doing is preparing a lot more than we are to endure the coming changes there are two things we need on a global scale right now that were not going to get but regardless the first is a massive decrease in global production capacity to address our aggregate emissions these have been rising every single year for longer than the forty something ive been alive and this number on its own solidifies our collapse it doesnt matter how much we recycle or conserve if we dont stop producing the massive amounts of emissions its all over the second is a massive monumental investment in infrastructure we should be fortifying everything from roads and bridges to buildings to coastlines as a whole we should be starting to relocate inland now gradually and sanely while we can we should be planning for this in terms of power grids and communication capacity and for potable water sewers all of that good stuff we stand to lose in the coming years and decades if you would prefer to do nothing and suffer it in that role that is your prerogative we are past the point where it matters what individuals do it matters what huge corporations and governments do individuals have never been very effective at coercing difficult governments with everybody losing their spine to the tolerance paradox these days which has been heavily played by those on the right im not even sure anybody is going to put up a real fight the things i describe might not change our collective fate but they would improve our quality of life during our decline we those of us already alive in this horrible place would suffer less during our lifetimes,1,1

leagueoflegends,this is just a copy from another comment i just posted but its about the exact same topic and your reply was the same as the other one so i hope youll excuse it oh i know and its definitely valid at least a lot more so than tsm svens cold hands from iem oakland 2016 ahah c9 definitely showed later on that they were way better than this but thats besides my point what matters in this discussion is the level they had in that specific series whatever the reason  gettig sick happens and can sadly happen again even if its not fair and is not representative of the true level of the team as you pointed out im just saying that weve seen in the past some very close series in the somewhat recent past 2 out of the last 3 times in play ins between na and the best wildcard teams sure there were some very logical explanations for it jensen was indeed sick and playing far below his level but the fact remains that some wildcards those as good as gam was have the potential to show up against some na teams not of the caliber of this years team liquid though in certain circumstances for instance i could definitely see a new gamlevel wildcard team beat the 3rd seed from na or hell even eu at worlds playins in a bo5 at some point in the future not necessarily this year or next year though well likely need a combination of the 3rd seed from said major region to be weak imagine 100 thieves last year if they were 3rd seed or performing poorly for whatever reason jensen being sick like last year and the wildcard team being good closer to the level of gam instead of the level of last years gambit who were straight up terrible but theres a big difference between the 3rd seed at worlds from na and the best team from na at msi especially with franchising being there teams are much more stable now and we have a basically allstar roster for the best team in na so i dont really see a wildcard beating them even in the future unless they progress tremendously or na has some very low year for some reason ps its the second time i have this exact same discussion same arguments exactly though not presented in the same order in the last two weeks on reddit last time ended up with me getting about 60 downvotes though people understood my point eventually i hope this time will turn up better ahah,0,1

relationship_advice,he may not hold as much weight into gifts and sentimental value as you do i know this is kind of cliche to suggest but you should read the five love languages and see what sparks for him usually couples are completely different mine is quality time and physical touch my boyfriends would probably be acts of service and words of affirmation it helped me to understand what i needed in a relationship to feel loved i should do the couples quiz with him to see what we are anyway he may not necessarily see the gifts as being something special my boyfriend doesnt keep cards letters at all he says its just paper clutter he may not realize hes behaving in such a way that hurts you because he doesnt view gifts maybe the same way you do you should at least let him know how youve felt dont say it like youve done this to me all these times but instead ive noticed a pattern that i could be reading into but i needed to let you become aware of how i am feeling after certain situations when ive made special gifts or saved up money to buy something for you my gift gets replaced within weeks for an upgraded model i feel very  fill in then blank when that happens like my gift wasnt good enough it may not be done intentionally but its occurred many times i wanted to know if instead i need to get guidance on what brand to buy some people are super particular about certain brands and like to research before they buy i want to make sure i am getting something that will be used and not tossed aside i like knowing that when you use xyz youll be reminded of me when you use it even if its just for a second at least thats how it is for me with the gifts youve bought me im not angry by any means i just want to find a solution where i can purchasegive something that youll actually use lets figure out what we can do together im using my boyfriend a lot for reference but usually when im getting him a pricey present ill talk to him about it first ask him questions to see if what im getting is something hed like or use or ill just outright ask hey do you like this im terrible at gifts though,0,1

news,gt i think names and pictures should absolutely be banned to discourage copycats whats the evidence that has shown the motive of copycats as fame any coverage is going to encourage copycats because it draws attention to how easy it is to kill people and how troubled people can address an issue at the hand of a gun killing of people based on their religionraceetc i hate that group too that person showed its possible to just kill them i can too killing of fellow students more complex but could be hatred for specific studentsteachers stress from school work or just easy targets for a hatred of life in general that might just be leading to a suicide by cop there seems to be so many other ways to gain fame that i cant see how villian status and 20 of jail with very possible death by cop during the event that would be the motive gt this would be a dream scenario for gun manufacturors its about addressing the motive for killings and decreasing that motive a side effect of gun manufacturers benediting shouldnt even be a thought would universal background checks have helped in this case how did the student gain access to the firearms,0,0

relationship_advice,sure but if you are in a hurry to seal the deal you are just plain stupid 2 years can be enough but again why rush something youll do the rest of your life it is stupid no matter what angle you look at it from if youre ready after 2 years you should still wait cus something might happen that is a gamechanger that they were keepin from you for 2 years which isnt that hard to do cus its only been 2 years rushing is never good you cant convince me otherwise infatuation is a thing getting married during infatuation phase is naive and immature and it happens wayyyy too much marriage is losing respect as a concept cus some people treat it as dating my relationship is stronger than ops and we arent married cus we dont want to rush something this huge that would be naive and stupid now op is tight cus she rushed into a marriage when she didnt know him that well it shows a lack of maturity imo,0,1

worldnews,and everyone in turkey knows the coup was plotted by gulen movement the opposition has been warning erdogan for decades about gulenists national security council declared them an enemy of the state which is trying to infiltrate government and military ranks with an aim to take over and and install a sharia regime back in 2003 and they partially succeeded with the help of erdogan gulenists successfully infiltrated the military judicial system police organization and started their fake coup trials back in 2007 in order to get rid of kemalist generals and open the career path for their recruits all the generals who participated in the 2015coup were fasttracked to being a general during those days erdogan disregarded all these warnings and allied himsepf with gulenist movement akp itself helped people from gulenist movement infiltrate every branch of government akp itself placed all the sackep people into those positions after gulenists and erdogan started to show differences gulenists declared war on him exposing his dirty laundry erdogan did not take this well and started sacking gulenists before the coup they already had extensive lists about gulenists people and their positions all because erdogan himself placed all those people there the coup happened as a response to an expected wave of arrests of gulenist generals in the military which was going to happen the next morning they were cornered and had to rush the coup expecting the kemalist generals who also hate erdogan would join them kemalists did not join the coup attempt and gulenists were left open and helpless hence the reason why the coup was so amateurish at that point erdogan declared state of emergency which gave him enough power to accelerate the sacking of gulenists they were able to sack that many people because 1they helped these islamist cult infiltrate themselves akp itself let these dogs in 2akp has been sacking these islamist cultists at a much slower rate already before the coup attempt the lists were already there and akp was going slowly to not cause a big uproar,1,1

movies,again youre misunderstanding what i am trying to say i am fine with films going more in depth with these uncomfortable ideas and stuff but i am referring to films that just portray problematic things in a positive light and try to say that people should do this and that it is healthy i am fine if its only about going in depth of the characters do engage in this idea and the reasons for that engagement or something like that anomalisa does have some creepy stuff in it but it does work with the story and it is meant to be a part of the character and show for how does the character act in such way and its not in this movie cause it is technically a child with the appearance of a man but still a 12 year old child in reality and the film doesnt make this sort of thing questionable or anything it just seems completely fine with it and doesnt at least show this sort of gray area and these film isnt supposed to be like a exploration of these subjects or anything but its just creepy idea that was overlooked and its innapropiate for such a film like big something else like lolita i guess i would be fine with since it is supposed to be character study of a pedophile but having normalized pedophilia shown as it is beautiful and healthy would just be problematic and bad lesson to have in a film or something like stalking and sexual harrassment these type of films do not really teach anything deeper or anything but its simply creepy and bad ideas put into film and unaware of how dark this sort of thing is to have in a film and being completely innapropiate,0,2

worldnews,gt assanges rights under uk law are a matter of uk law and guaranteed by uk law while in the uk at least there was never any doubt that his rights under the law would be respected what he did do was flee a legal process when it didnt seem to be going his way that is incorrect his rights at that point were already violated multiple times including the right to the presumption of innocence and a fair trial furthermore if there was no intention to make him face refoulement the judiciary could have simply made this clear gt again sweden issued an extradition request that is totally in line with uk and swedish law the uk was happy that sweden wanted him to answer a charge in sweden that was appropriate under swedish law the fact that the swedish process for charging and investigating a crime is marginally different from that in the uk doesnt undermine that gt you make it sound like sweden was arbitrarily asking for assange to be extradited without cause it wasnt thats pretty clear in fact this is not what european arrest warrants are for sweden was not able to produce any evidence that the allegations against assange were credible and failed to even put any charges the european arrest warrant is not something that should be taken lightly as the european parliament put it this is not something you use against someone who has been charged with multiple car thefts gt yeah often you do even in the uk usually you are arrested when there is enough information to support an arrest then the police will investigate further and you may be released with no further action or you may be charged the extradition process is effectively that a request to affect an arrest there is no evidence and there was no formal investigation gt sweden requested that assange be extradited because he refused to return to sweden voluntarily assange then availed himself of the uk court system to fight that extradition when that didnt work he breached his bail conditions and hid in an embassy because he had no obligation to go to sweden he offered his full support to cooperate with the investigation remotely as is not unusual for innocent but even citizens under investigation who are abroad to do gt there is no way you can look at this and claim that sweden or the uk breached the law or didnt apply the appropriate process assange however deliberately breached the law after giving assurances and guaranteeing those with other peoples money and put himself out of reach of both the uk and swedish authorities whether the law was broken or not is irrelevant everyone has a right to a presumption of innocence and through clever legal manoeuvring swedish prosecutors and the uk judiciary were able to bypass that right and arbitrarily detain assange for years,0,1

movies,even if he werent in trouble financially the market forces are what they are if youre cage do you take the leading man role for 20 million or the supporting weird role for 34 million and then from there his paycheck is at that baseline its not so much the roles he seeks out but whether producers are calling him for roles and not many are going to want to pay nic cage his salary for a supporting role when they can get a known character actor at a drastically reduced price i know he does a ton of direct to video now because he doesnt want to go broke but hes the more than likely the most expensive piece of all of those movies as he gets older and less in demand he may slide down further in pay and suddenly be available for character work but if he can get the big paychecks for the lead role and producers only see the value of him there then hes going to keep going for them,0,1

funny,gt first the very link you provided from webster also includes a definition that doesnt include emotional distress thats what im talking about when i say youre cherry picking im using the definition that i value i dont value pain as just a reaction to external forces i view it as a reaction plus an emotional response why do you keep saying im cherry picking it means nothing youre cherry picking as well if that matters at all gt second there is no loose definition that i am using its the very definition of observable pain that the scientists who conducted both studies i linked and there are more if you again bothered to google it used youre using a definition that has no value to me i dont view chemicals or instinctive reaction to be pain plants release chemicals in response to being damaged would you call that pain gt third most of my arguments thus far have been adjusted to give you an upper hand where crustaceans might not have emotions unfortunately emotions by your standards are not easy if not impossible to measure by my standards emotions arent a magical force that comes from a soul if you will its chemical reactions being fed to our brain and how our brain interprets them chemical reactions that have been observed in the above mentioned studies youre right it is hard to determine whether an animal has emotions or not thats why i also value consciousness and with consciousness usually comes emotion and there are ways to determine if an animal is conscious or not there is no evidence suggesting that lobsters are conscious and given that they only have about 100000 neurons as opposed to an ant that has 250000 neurons not to mention the simple nervous system id say that lobsters dont fit my definition of pain gt fourth how does nociceptive pain not count as pain im genuinely curious on this one as its a classification of pain that we as humans also experience nociception is just a reaction like i said it does not fit my definition of pain gt and finally while difficult its not impossible to prove a negative specially when it can be observed such as the crustaceans not reacting at all to the electric shocks sure,0,1
gameofthrones,well i think calling them pawns and cogs is incorrect arya would have died without beric therefore the nk would have won thats a pretty big deal to me mellisandre helped delay the nk and his army giving everyone more time she also encouraged arya when she was basically paralysed with fear so everyone played their part and have a role to say jons role was the retake winterfell just doesnt make sense also if that was true then jon would have died after winning the battle of the bastards i 100 think jon will die by the end of the show but he will die fulfilling whatever his purpose was but right now i dont think its obvious why he was brought back because we all assumed he was the prince that was promised but based on the rules the show has set up we have yet to see what jons purpose is but we know that when he fulfils that purpose he will die,0,2

hockey,i mean i never said i was unbiased either but i would like to think that ive been pretty objective about the whole thing at no point have i said anything other than it was a stupid and dirty hit that i wish he would cut out of his game completely the only reason i brought up the after the whistle punches is because you said he has never been suspended for that before and my counterpoint was that those types of punches happen more often than you are admitting and they rarely come with suspensions unless it is a full on haymaker sucker punch if you really think no one in nhl has ever done anything like this before then i would argue that is letting your bias creep in a bit so yes i do think ive at least been a bit more objective than you since i at least can recognize that its a shitty fucking play but as my original comment stated it shouldnt be all that surprising that the dops didnt take action on this as i said if we both have reasons to be biased then what is the point of continuing the conversation you are convinced he should be suspended and although i know it was a shitty hit i also think you are being intentionally obtuse in ignoring plays that are similar to this that have not resulted in suspensions in the past so once again i hope you enjoy the rest of the playoffs i will expect some response coming after one sentence of my response while largely ignoring everything else i said,0,1
videos,from what ive seen the documented the motion sickness problems are affecting 2540 of users and that number spikes to 50 or 60 percent with motion intensive games thats a minority but its a 1 in 3 minority in a relatively small community because there is no system yet that does not result in nausea for any player it would cut the player base and the number of copies sold with the vive i notice i can avoid the nausea by doing a walking or jiggling in place to shake my head with the artificial motion i guess there are other things i didnt talk about youd have to rebalance melee weapons to not be strike speed dependent or make them triggered youd have to separate the player camera from player shooting youd have to account for two eyeball inputs then theres the jump crouch mechanic once you got past that youd have to do all the stuff the source engine doesnt support like vrres texture files and models throwing stuff picking stuff up then you could get to the input speed thing and start dealing with the command input speed by rebalancing move speeds and enemy damage but someone already tried something similar with dead effect and killing floor porting to vr instead of just building for the platform doesnt work too well,0,0

relationship_advice,there are two answers here imo amp cheating boundaries are different for everyone so some people may be okay with their partner sexting others or even having sex outside the main relationship and i cant see a problem with that as long as the boundaries are discussed understood and agreed by both parties amp if the real question is someone got caught sexting and is trying to claim it isnt cheating and some people are backing them up wtf then i totally get your confusion i think many people in an exclusive relationship would consider it a form of cheating and only try to back track when they get themselves into a situation where if they admit it is cheating they are likely to get ejected from a relationship they still wish to keep exploiting amp i think it makes sense to have the where are our boundaries conversation pretty early on in a relationship that way you both get to make sure the things you consider cheating are clearly understood to avoid hurting one another,0,1

asoiaf,theres a lot more to a story thematically where darkness and light are concerned than merely a physical fight of good vs evil melisandres quote speaking to davos isnt about defeating a final boss necessarily with swords and shields though some of that may come to pass in exploring what lies within the hearts and minds of those who would inherit the world and those who would perish in seeing the vision through between here and there on the road to fulfilled or unfulfilled prophecy theres a myriad of ways to wrap character arcs and conclude an epic in thematically satisfying ways grrm is obviously entirely capable of doing that and hopefully will a lot of fan disappointment stems from the fact that the got showrunners have proven themselves incapable or unwilling to see beyond the idea of subverting a physical good vs evil fight by using wellestablished characters in outofcharacter ways and their refusal to adhere to already established lore and intrashowworld logic laid down in the early seasons the darkness versus the light could make for a much richer and more rewarding payoff to all that was hinted at and foreshadowed leading up to now including excellent thematic endings for these characters that would evoke real emotion instead of a reasonable facsimile that dampd have chosen to ignore all of that storytelling potential and actually deep and memorable payoff in favor of checking things off their list of badassery is not only massively aggravating its insulting,0,1

AmItheAsshole,esh  going against the grain here with this judgement but its not just about him wanting you to fight your ex over moving out of state its about both of your abilityinability to resolve conflict the reason that youre an asshole too is summed up pretty well with gt i feel im justified in distancing myself and not engaging in too much conversation with him as it always turns into some argument about taking the kids away from their dad and me not doing what he wants sorry conversations not going well or conflict not being easy to resolve is never a justification for distancing yourself from your partner in fact unless youre preparing to leave your partner distancing yourself from them is never really justified because at best its going to give you no opportunity to resolve conflict and at worst its actually going to make the conflict even worse gt i have decided to avoid the conversation because i always lose he makes me feel terrible for wanting my kids to be my top priority i dont want to have those conversations anymore we communicate a ton im not avoiding an issueim avoiding being hurt this is a lot of blaming language youre basically saying its his fault i dont talk to him but you are absolutely culpable here too you cant resolve the conflict if you dont engage and you always losing isnt just his fault  you need to take responsibility for your own ability to engage and communicate effectively he makes me feel terrible this is more blaming language used to avoid your own responsibility your partner cant make you feel anything if hes being manipulative or aggressive for example that is not appropriate and his behavior should absolutely be called out but your partner cannot take responsibility for you feeling terrible and it is certainly not an excuse to avoid your responsibility to engage with your partner you have two choices 1 engage with your partner and realize that resolving this conflict is your responsibility too  and that the longer you disengage the more you are contributing to creating a rift between you two 2 leave him that second option is the only way you can justify disengaging with him frankly its not fair to ask your partner to stay with you when you are unwilling to engage with him about this and work toward resolving your conflict i know this isnt rrelationship_advice but heres a quick road map for resolving your conflict  before you talk to him ask yourself is there any way that you may be willing to move out of state  any creative solution that makes this possible for example if your exhusband agrees to it or if your kids agree to it etc the answer doesnt have to be yes but its important you go into a conversation with him having deeply considered where youre at and what you cancant do to resolve this conflict then ask yourself is there anyway that you are okay with him moving out state while you stay in state  ask him if hes willing to accept any answer that doesnt involve you moving out of state honestly ask this question no judgement if he is completely unwilling to accept that answer and you are completely unwilling to move out of state you might need to accept that reality and have a conversation about whether or not it is practical for you to stay together because if both things are absolutely unshakably true it is not very practical for you to be together  in any other case now you need to find the creative solution talk with him about what the real problems are that absolutely need to be addressed and tell him your absolute boundaries and what you cancant do and make it clear that it is on both of you to find a solution that works for both of you in order to make the relationship work for example are you both willing to continue to be together long distance  where he moves out of state and you dont are you willing to move out of state if your exhusbandkids consent are you willing to move out of state if its somewhere within reasonable driving distance for weekend visits  it sounds like you need to have a conversation with him about your priorities it sounds like he resents that your decision to have your kids closer to their father trumps his desire to move your family out of state and it sounds like he has shamed you for it and that maybe even youve felt a bit guilty about this if your priority in this situation is to keep your family close over and above his desire to move out of state you need to make that crystal clear these are the terms of your relationship you have children and sometimes you are going to make them a priority over your marriage this is also sometimes going to be complicated and messy with no straightforward or perfect solution for everyone this is the agreement he made when he married you and if he wishes to continue to be in a successful relationship with you he needs to acknowledge that it is legitimate and fair for you to sometimes prioritize your kids over your marriage if he cant do that its important to explain to him that your marriage cant be successful however difficult this conversation is or however upset at you he becomes that doesnt relieve your responsibility to have the conversation unless youre willing to leave him so if i were you i would ensure that i went into a conversation like this with my head on straight and have a bullet focus on successfully resolving this conflict and dont let the conversation go off the rails or become a blame game or get emotionally heightened if he were to start to throw around blame himself dont think about his responsibility and what he could be doing better  just stay focused no your own responsibility to find a solution and to maintain your calm and focus,0,0

gameofthrones,the writing is different but not necessarly that much worse it is because it plotdriven as of sesaon 7 and much less characterdriven and when we got an episode that was solely character driven s08e02 that had good dialogue people were starting to complain that it wasnt paced enough and even calling it a filler people are on this bandwagon of hate for the show because its cool and because its cool to copypaste the same generic nonsense over and over sure killing jaime wouldve been appropriate but they didnt did that make s07e04 any worse it really didnt it was arguably one of the best episodes of the show its the same as blackwater why did the lannisterstyrells come at the exact right time in season 2 to save the day tyrion was unconcious on the battlefield that was getting overrun by stannis army and ploof 1 second before that happened they stormed in why isnt that a trope as well why was it then accepted s07e06 was pretty poor ill give you that but thats one episode in the 30 episodes since s4 its kinda funny how you ignored the entire comment about how i showed you that danys scenes grrm fabricated scenes made no sense in the earlier seasons do you at least agree after reading that,0,1

FortNiteBR,gtthis bug is not a critical aspect of the game it is a one of the challenges for the end game challenges and one of if not the hardest with this bug it becomes almost impossible yes its unfortunate the bug was not found before the ltm was released but its also extremely frustrating trying to do the challenge only to be set back by other players either griefing or also trying to do the challenge a challenge that is hard enough with only a 50 of being able to do it with it only being available when your on the chitauri side and then having only 6 chances with your competition being every other player on the field outside picking up the first dropped stone which in itself is still a challenge picking up a stone is an extremely rare task that only seems to frustrate players as they try to complete the challenge with limited time while trying to complete a challenge that has become harder than it already is i feel for the poor devs but they should figure out a compromise for those trying to complete the challenge right now its gotten to the point the avengers team is less likely to stop you getting a stone then your teammates,0,1

apexlegends,i think sniping being good is unhealthy for a game like this specifically because it invalidates a healthy riskreward system i am against telling people how to play if you want to drop skull town every time and die playing aggro or if you want to camp at the top of a hillbuilding do your thing passive long range play and camping will make the game more stagnant and generally less exciting if this is the playstyle you enjoy you are allowed to enjoy it but in a game that closes a circle in on you and quite literally tries to force aggression sniping will never feel as good to play against vs midrange or close range fighting its less risk for the sniper and the same reward vs playing aggressively at a much higher risk to the aggressive player for the same reward if aggression isnt rewarded properly the game will become too passive and eliminate any reason to play aggro which eliminates an entire playstyle a game that rewards aggression however still allows passive players to play their style,1,0
marvelstudios,i wasnt alive during the original star wars trilogy but to me these movies are bigger and better and a completely different situation star wars told a single mostly plot driven narrative the mcu has told many stories many of them connecting to others and making it possible to bring so many of them together in a cohesive way and beyond the story almost every hero is nuanced we understand their motivations their flaws their goals we see them grow with every movie and feel like we grow with them storytelling of this level has never been done on such a large scale in film before star wars at least as it was before the sequel trilogy will always be near and dear to my heart but the mcu has surpassed it in every way im upset that the mcu as its existed for the past 10 years is over but as a great character once said part of the journey is the end,0,1

freefolk,first they gave us that horribly conceived sex scene with her and gendry where she essentially forces herself on him like a wild animal and he has to go along with it because he has no time to do anything else and who would be up to saying no to arya she is pathologically violent and gleefully homicidal shes even creepier than the character formerly known as bran in my opinion anyway after that bullshit they apparently turn her into a superhero one who seemingly has either the power of teleportation super speed or invisibility in any case it really seems like they ran out imaginative steam in this episode or could not find a way to patch up the plot holes they dug for themselves without resorting to such a pathetic laughable and boring use of deus ex machina and what really pisses me off is that a great deal of people are lapping this shit up this level of triteness and predictability is what i expect from most superhero movies and thats what i dont watch them anymore the last 3060 minutes of every one of these marvel movies is always more or less the same cgi overkill big ass splosions new york city most likely being reduced to rubble for the 17th time important characters seemingly on the brink of death being saved at the last moment omg who saw that coming its like the got production team took all their cues in this episode from the avengers franchise and all the other capeshit movies of recent years and the result was a boring ugly predictable pile of muddy shit that betrayed everything that used to make this show special in the end grrm really deserves the blame for letting the control of his magnum opus slip out of his handsor willingly passing it on whatever the case may be he irrevocably fucked his own story,0,0

unpopularopinion,the thing about coming into a class late is that is a disruption even if youre doing it quietly as possible unless its a huge university course held in an auditorium style room people are going to be disrupted by your entering late its 1520 min into the class lecture is going full swing everyone is trying their hardest to keep up writing down what the teacher is saying someone enters the classroom late the door opens they come in and have to put down all their stuff and take their seat to some that is just a quick distraction just a quick glance up to the door acknowledging someone came in late and then going back to what youre doing but not everyone can do that to the student in class whos suffering with severe adhd youve probably cost them the rest of that lecture because theyve lost their focus and all they can think about now is the sounds going on why youre late why theyve been late in the past and then its just a rabbit hole of unrelated thoughts not to mention that its going to throw off the teacher and cause them to lose focus and to be honest a large part of it is fairness everyone else made the decisions and the planning to be able to get there on time they committed to coming to class on time so they wont be causing a disruption for their fellow students and their teacher and lastly its just rude being late is rude it shows you didnt care enough about the event to make it a priority to be there on time it shows the teacher you dont value their time or the information they are providing you and it shows your peers that you believe the rules dont have to apply to you i personally always admired the teachers who would close their door after class began and wouldnt open it after regardless if someone shows up late if youre not going to commit to it and be there for the whole thing you shouldnt be there at all you signed up for a class at this specific time and thats the only time you should be able to collect it if you took that 8am class but hate waking up early and often show up late just know that there was probably someone who wanted that time slot who needed it to be able to work or have time with their family who would have shown up on time every day and wasnt able to take the class at that time because there werent any seats left your being late may not effect everyone in that classroom but it will effect some and it could mean that youre taking an opportunity from someone else who would love to have it and are then wasting part of it,0,1
