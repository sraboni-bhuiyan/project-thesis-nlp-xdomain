gameofthrones,gtthey were in communication via the palantir but they were both working to suit their own ends saruman was specifically trying to work against sauron by trying to take the ring for himself while simultaneously undermining gandalf amp the istari and the counsel elrond aragorn celeborn while they were distracted by mordor none of this refutes my point though you are basically just pointing out that they are separate characters it was always one cohesive story nonetheless  the humans hobbits and elves fighting against the necromancers of the two towers it was all one singular overarching narrative in game of thrones the conflict north of the wall has nothing to do with cersei or the iron throne they are completely separate narratives that are stitched together,0,1

gameofthrones,so many of your questions were answered though bran was observing the battle through the crows to make sure everything continued to line up thats why he followed the night king and that is why he looked past the night king to make sure arya was there the dagger was valaryan steal which the show said multiple times kills white walkers jon even killed one the night king was created by the children of the forest to destroy mankind the night king interpreted that as removing mankind from the world which included killing bran who effectively held the entire knowledge of humanity with him melisandre was there like berrick and the hound to fulfill the prophecy and help arya on her way to killing the night king she was the one who told arya she was supposed to go after him why would the wights risk fighting personally when the entire castle is outfitted with the only two things that could kill them that would have been some seriously bad writing it would make more sense to let your massive replenishing horde desimate the castle then go in a take out bran would suck if there were a trained assassin waiting to ambush you but what chance is there of that happening amiright a ton of this story youre wanting is right there already youre just missing it,1,1
