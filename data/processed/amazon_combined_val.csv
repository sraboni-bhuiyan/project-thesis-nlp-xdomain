pretty but you have to bend the metal to put it on and try to bend it symmetrically the sides and back are elastic with a snap at the back which looks weird and cheap if not covered by a jacket or something,1
i ordered a pair of these cargo shorts in gray and liked them so much i ordered a second pair in tan the first pair are great they fit as expected and are made of a very soft comfortable material i also like that they come down to the top of my knee the second pair fit and feel the same way but unfortunately in spite of what the ad and description says they are not cargo shorts theyre just regular shorts i do nature photography which involves hiking and carrying equipment and having a lot of pockets for loose gear a water bottle and miscellaneous items comes in very handy i have read other reviews from purchasers who had the same problem ordered cargo shorts received regular shorts otherwise nice shorts i plan on ordering at least one more pairbr br year later update look carefully at each photo and description for each color although theyre all under the general description cargo shorts and most of them are a few of the color choices show a photo of plain non cargo shorts and if you order that color thats what you will get otherwise i have been satisfied with the shorts they are comfortable just stretchy enough without being too stretchy and the material is soft and not nylony i wore one pair so often while hiking with the dog and carrying a bunch of equipment in the pockets that they eventually a yearish later wore out but i feel like i got my moneyre worth so i ordered another pair i have not yet experienced the zipper failure that some reviews mention but one of the two pair ive had for a year does have a zipper that will sometimes not always inadvertently oops come down if wasnt locked in the up position i wear them with an untucked shirt so its not a huge deal if it happens the other pair does not do that,2
came on time its a pretty top but the arm holes go almost to my waist,1
seems rather cheaply made but i havent washed it yet runs a bit small but still very cute,1
it is a bit small,1
really had a difficult time adjusting the band i ended up ordering a new band,1
love the weight of them and love the color,2
the bottoms fit poorly because they are cheap and the white lining of the bottoms show while you wear them the top however is so cute and fits very well,1
cute little hat true color was perfect as shown matched a yellow wind breaker jacket bought earlier,2
nice looking but the chemical smell coming off of these shoes is staggering ive been aorithem out for a week and may not wear them at all for fear of whatever poison is causing this smell,0
great bra however after a few months the underwire started popping out and stabbing its a great bra when it works but doesnt last as long as i had hoped,1
i received lots of compliments,2
i love this hat it drops to 0 c and im good to go the girls love the hat i think it looks cool this hat stays on and does its job,2
the earrings are fine they look as pictured but extremely flimsy and break easily a few pairs i wasnt even able to wear because they broke beforehand if youre looking for quantity they are fine for a couple uses hopefully if youre looking for quality seek elsewhere,1
the sleeves are super short and not tight around the wrist area the letters were stuck together when got it,0
i loved this necklace for about 2 weeks then it tarnished,0
for the price these look extremely cheap wasnt expecting high quality and i dont typically wear costume jewelry but at 20 these look like i found them at the dollar tree i would skip these and look at macys or kendra scott,0
the shirt is very well made and the fabric it good but it was small for the advertised size,1
worst 4399 ive ever spent its ok if it fits im 5ft 3inch and 107lbs i ordered extra small but its still baggy in the bottom area amd around the waist its cheaply made definitely not worth the price i could have got a really nice jumpsuit for 45 super disappointed and cant return cause return window is closed amazon customer service told me to try to wash it to shrink it lol guess im out my money big loss cause cant wear something thats 4x bigger than me especially loose fitted around legs and crotch,0
cheap looking,1
very poorly sewed tore the first day on the straps,0
very stiff ans difficult to put on a 3 month old very cute though,0
fit as expected,1
this product even came with a case the luggage scale itself works great,2
my 3rd columbia in last 8 years horrible piece velcro pieces running parallel to main zipper are so aggressive they chewed my rs sleeve every time i touch body with my hand velcro rips fibers from rs sleeve after less than 2 months brand new jacket looks worse than my 8 year old jacket i use when shoveling snow contacted columbias help desk they were totally uninterested in doing anything last reply was you ship it to us and we will review it and decide poor design doubt material combination was ever testedbr guess no more this brand for me,0
i absolutely love this romper and its very flattering i only have 2 issues with the quality 1 the side zipper doesnt work it came closed but i cant open it so i have to just pull the romper on and off and im afraid this might break it 2 the neck closure button in the back is nearly impossible to close by myself other than those 2 issues this romper is one of my favorites it gives me a waistline which is one of my thicker areas and the length is perfect im 53 150lbs and have a size medium,1
these drawstring bags are a great deal they are sturdy enough to hold a few books for class or a change of clothes or shoes much nicer than the price would suggest,2
fun gift well made received promptly,2
im so bummed i was so excited when i saw them but they are not the same as they used to do sent them back and still searching for a flip flop i like,0
good quality they were a little small for my son he normally wears a 32 waist,1
this came in it was not as pictured with the background and black around the air force insignia just etched onto the stainless,0
cute quality shirt but order a size down,2
i am just getting back to running after a few years of cycling only i was looking for shoes that were flexible and would help to minimize impact while i worked to get my form back thankfully the recommendation of these shoes paid off they have a soft feel and help promote a proper running style i had some knee pain issues with some asics i ran in right before these and the realflex speeds have completely eliminated the pain for me these help promote more of a midsole strike which definitely helps to minimize impact i would recommend them to anyone looking for more of a natural feeling running shoe,2
this bra runs very small under the breastsbr i am a size 68 and usually fit in a l bra i bought an xl and its too tight very uncomfortable,0
product to small,0
i ordered this for my pajama party the size was correct but the top is not made for large bust,2
very nice,2
these pants are amazing well constructed good quality light weight fabric i am a fat waist size 44 plus size 2224 54 woman i am very pleased with the roomy fit love the pockets didnt give 5 stars because the color is substantially darker than the picture shown they are actually dark brown and i wanted the color in the photo nevertheless i ordered 2 more pair in different colors,2
lets talk about the fit its way too large on my broad shoulders but too small on my size 4 rear end i buy large or xlarge to accommodate my wide shoulders this is a definate no its shaped like a triangle cant say ive ever seen a shirt like this dont waste your money,0
these pants look nice cute style but not a good product for a busy hard core weather lover kid the pants already have holes in less than six months of infrequent use maybe every other week,1
not the best material remains wrinkled,1
none if their products last very long i had the backpack before this gave this a try to carry a laptop strap holder fell apart after the first week last time i buy their product,0
the outfit itself is cute i love the colors and the fit the material is a little scratchy but not so much it takes away the cuteness,2
this is not worth the price it doesnt work well at all i dont recommend this product at all i will return this product,0
looks nice for the price the black wears off after not long in small parts,1
lovely cow girl boots great colour and design and very comfortable to wear really good value for money,2
really like this swimsuit hoping to buy the navy polka dot one next i am 52 145 and b cup fits great all around and shows off my curves recommend this swimsuit to any one looking for something that is sexy cute but hides the 34flaws34 that having children does to a womans body,2
the fabric is so thin and noticed a hole in the crotch area after a few hours of wearing them i wouldnt waste your money get somthing else thus is terrible quality,1
the navy boucle cardigan is comfortable to wear but it is very stretchy and is starting to pill i think the size is correct but it feels big because of the stretch,1
not what i expected wanted to return them but totally forgot to oh well i have some new tanks to sleep in now,1
very stiff and too heavy for me,1
too small,0
wonderful summer dress,2
the colors werent my favorite so i sent back,1
this is exactly the shirt i need for work professional yet rugged also they are a bit long so they stay tucked in all day a little large so they are very comfortable to wear i have a lot of other carhartt clothing and i will add more of these,2
this watch is way to small for a guy and im not a big guy 57 and 155 lbs with normal size wrist barely fits around my wrist and looks like a womens watch i wore these old style casios for years a long time ago and this is not the same product,0
too easy to poke a hole through it the threads are spaced far apart,0
not bad i think i needed more padding,1
i love long johns these stretch out like crazy,1
soft cute material and design but the size i ordered did not arrive,1
just like i expected classy,2
smaller than what it says not a true size for women of size 11,0
it feels like but its super long its just not fitting or flattering at all its fine as a pajama shirt but not for everyday use,1
these worked great the first 3 or 4 months then the lenses began to delaminate from the margins inward i suspect salt crystallization in between the lamellae caused the problem which worsened until about a cm of the margin had delaminated i could still see through the delaminated portion albeit not clearly but then the delaminated portions of the lens would not fit properly in the frame anymore and eventually the entire lens popped out after getting tumbled in a wave the exact same thing happened with the second pair i had purchasedbr br after 15 years of trying many different kinds of sun glasses for kite surfing and ultimately losing every pair in one way or another to the ocean i have settled on the ultra cheap 3m tekk 11330 virtua antifog safety glasses they arent polarized but they are 999 uv protected and at about 300 a pair im ok loosing them add a brightly colored croakie with the one of those little rubber floats and you probably wont even loose your 300 investment one more bonus about these safety glasses is that they dont have separate lenses that will pop out the lenses and frames are one piece of molded noshatter polycarbonate no more faceplant popouts,1
wellthe footbed is very soft and of course the knit cloth uppers arent going to rub blisters on my feet but the lack of support means my feet hurt i bought them to wear to disney but after wearing them around for a few days i questioned whether my feet just hurt in general or whether the lack of support contributed i put on my spencos and wore them around inside for a while and my feet felt better some people can walk around in these sanuks all day without issue but i guess i cant,1
some of my cards sick and are hard to retrieve but it does the job ok,1
i had a pair of blue blockers in the early 90s and i swore by them they were priced like other glasses so i thought why not went back got several pairs more that lasted years these are not thatcompletely the quality of the lenses are the same in terms of clarity the amber tinge doesnt bother me which is why i used to call them my orange glasses i have a pair of hd vision glasses and when i pit them against each otherthe hd glasses win hands down because of the lack of amber tinge and price however these blueblockers look better while i cycle im mad i paid what i did but this is the cheapest ive found,1
seem to be made well for price a simple boot i am a size 10 wide needed size 11 fits better with size up but still a little snug on sides of toes also no arch support they are soft inside and warm have not yet tried in snow will chg rating after i determine how they perform in snowwater proof as of now i would recommend as a decent basic snow boot if they perform well this winter i will update and increase the rating,1
i loved the way it looked but it was so scratchy it actually gave me similar to a rug burn on my neck just from the duration of trying it on if you can figure out a way to make the fabric not scratch the bajeezus out of you then go for it,0
the dress looks amazing fits like a glove when you order the proper size shows off your figure well perfect for a hourglass figure,2
nice design but way too short im a small and ordered a medium sent it back,0
i really really wanted to love this dress unfortunately the material of the dress i received was not the same as the one pictured online it was scratchy and cheap looking didnt fit right either length was too short for me also tight in the middle and then loose on top for reference i bought this in a medium im 56 and almost always wear a medium might fit a younger shorter person better returned this for a refund,0
fit well and looks good i bought it as a gift for my husband and he is very pleased with it,2
runs small and you get what you pay for wherever the fabric stretches example the front knot it will look grayish instead of black very cheap look and feel as reference i wear size 6 pants and this medium was tiny no room for the rear or hips definitely not for curvy people,0
this is an excellent bra that runs true to size and fits comfortably however the lace front does not give a smooth appearance underneath shirts so if you get this bra it does not need to be worn under thin material shirts or tshirts as it will appear bumpy underneath the fabric and will not give you that smoothing appearance i wear it underneath my denim shirts or sweatshirts and sweaters that are thicker and will not show the texture of the fabric if you dont care about those things then this is a definitely comfortable bra that you could wear daily however being in a professional environment i have to be sure that my undergarments dont show through my clothes so i save this bra for around the house or on the weekends when im running errands and i just want comfort and dont care so much about whether a bra shows through my clothes or not,2
i bought this black cheetah baggalini for a friend when she finally went to her po box she was surprised and thanked me for 34the pumpkin bag34 i ordered a black bag and an orange bag was delivered insteadbr br the description clearly states 34cheetah black34 and i bought it for my friend when she complimented me on my black baggalini bag delivery was fast my friend likes the bag she didnt know i ordered black but buyer bewareyou may order one color but receive delivery of something different,0
i tried these pajama pants on immediatelybr they fit fine i washed them according to instructions and now they are several inches shorter in length as well as shorter in the torso area i am not one to expose my butt crack so im tossing the 2 i boughtbr i can handle the shrinkage in legs but not the torso bluntly put they crawl up badbr miserably uncomfortable,0
it fits weird the material is nice,0
a little long but nice product,2
purchased size small listing says length is 39434 but the dress i received was 4434 length too long also the dress is see throughbr going t return,0
good fabric but the fit is odd after reading the review that it runs small i ordered the medium but its too large and sleeve is too long then i ordered the small the front looks ok but shoulder is too narrow i cannot move in it so i have to return both i originally give it two stars then increase to three stars as it has a detailed size chart note the burst is too large compared to shoulder length guess this is the reason for mixed reviews about the fit,1
very comfortablewaiste comes up a little too high for me but overall i love themvery soft well made,2
very soft and warm wife wears it after nine and then she frequently wears it to bed it was a christmas gift to her,2
ok,1
runs 3 sz too small,0
the arms are way too big just not attractive,0
fabric not soft or comfortable returning,0
this shirt has a nice bit of stretch to it and is very comfortable i love the longer sides its easy to dress up or down 34 sleeves make it wearable in any season i love it here with my leggingsbr i was surprised when i opened the package and there were no wrinkles that in itself is a bonus thinking of getting the black and red one for christmas,2
exactly what i expected,2
great pair of sunglasses they are good quality and have a great mirror quality that i was looking for they werent quite right for my face shape so i gave them to a friend and she loves them it was packaged with care and arrived on time i received this product at a discount and i would recommend this brand if youre into their mirror reflective lenses,2
face is too small glass scratches easily,1
if you have oil of any kind on your face from including sunscreen this will leave a pinkpurple stain on your face light blue didnt do this,0
ordered these in early september and they still have not showed up item shows package lost i have contacted them for a refund and have heard nothing,0
as others have said false advertising gloves were paper thin did not have the stitching in the picture and also dont seem to be shaped to fit the hands of a human,0
love it,2
poor quality poor fit,1
very narrow kind of itchy pretty color though returned it,0
love traveling products have several and love them all,2
i should have sent it back it is not usable for all my jewelry,1
the pattern design on the dress and the seams are way off not what is discrived on online its horrible i would not wear this out in public i would definatley not recommend to buy quality is horrible,0
this coat was garbage the quality was awful i was incredibly disappointed that this was even sold on amazon this is quality i would expect from the wish app not amazon,0
love the shoes fit my feet very well a little too big across the toe and wish the buckle really adjusted other wise great shoebr good quality and skid resistant sole living in washington where it does rain quite a bit need a good nonsliding solebr i plan to get another pair to hike in,2
i use these as my everyday casual workout pant the texture is smooth and the pants are durable ive bought them before,2
these shoes are not worth the price no support inside what so evercheaply made,0
absolutely love it,2
made well and my grandson loved it,2
always wanted one and exactly what i needed love the satin bag it came in as well,2
yep they stay in place this is the first headband that ive ever tried that actually stays where you want it to only drawback that ive noticed is that i had a dent in my forehead after wearing it with the knot in front as shown on the product description so i wont wear it that way again because my husband told me that i looked like a fortuneteller this is a versatile headband so you can figure out whats works best for you and it will most likely remain in place,2
my son loves them,2
these are hoop earrings,0
not exactly the color you see on the picture however the product is good,2
bought these for swimming usa masters in february and lasted till august they fit great and look great i regular wash them in the shower with cold water and swim suite shampoo to help remove chlorine its been a hot summer here around august i am washing myself in the shower after a swim and start to notice my rear end has some type of dark ink i dont know if that is the chloraban fabric leaking from the waist but definitely was leaking and in the pictures you can kind of see the waist line with color fade as if something was spilled on it it also has a smell to it thats not very pleasant i dont know if this had to do with being exposed to so much heat because after i swam i sat out to tan in them i ordered another pair and gonna see how long they last this time going into the winter season,1
terrible fit very unflattering,0
beautiful but the print fades away,1
i enjoyed this watch for the first 812 months but the band is fairly cheap and more importantly the watch doesnt work it used to be that i had to turn it ahead a minute or two each day as it would fall behind that wasnt a huge deal now though it goes way too fast i reset it each morning but within a couple hours it is 10 minutes fast and that just continues throughout the day making the watch basically uselessbr br very disappointing,0
i have a 44 chest and the xl fits well i didnt pay attention and ordered the double zipper which i dont really needbut thats on me,2
excellent want for a teenagers it was a christmas present to my son and he is in love with this watch really cool design,2
very unhappy with this feels like 3 sizes too small,0
not entirely sold on the peacock or fox rings they dont hold the string in place well the third is okay but ill be looking for something else to use,1
i would have kept the shirts but 2 of them had seams that didnt come down to end of sleeve and one side of shirtbr very light weight good garment othert than not being sewn correctly,0
very cheap chain discolors almost immediately,0
ordered these for me and my boyfriend for an american flag themed party and i am pretty sure these glasses were won us the best dressed prize we had so many compliments and they are super fun,2
this product was a gift the arms are a bit long but the person receiving the coat fixed that in less than a minute he loves this coat and it is very flattering on him theres enough room to layer when it gets colder it feels so soft inside its a win thank you,2
these are perfectly functional sleep pants and aside from them being a tiny bit small they work as you would expect,1
a little disappointed ive had the price lit a little more than a month and a 12 it is already starting to tarnish near the clasp poor quality i guess very disappointed,0
its almost impossible to get my childs foot in without causing her injury size 7m with other toddler sneakers one can either open up the front or the tongue can be pulled back far enough to allow one to simply place the childs foot in then close the shoe around it but here laces cannot be loosened and the tongue only stretches the tiniest bit so i have to point her foot downwards into the shoe then rely on a 1 year old to slide her foot forward while i pull on the back it would literally require sweat on my part and tears from my child to put these shoes on they are terribly designed which is a shame because they look super cute and shipped quickly hence the 2 stars shipped them back the same day,0
i am big so it seems small but i still like it,2
find something thicker if you are living in a very cold place this is made for those cities like la which has no winter at all,1
good price thin material seem to be wearing quickly in toe area,1
she loves them,2
the biggest problem i have with these is that its not high waisted when i go snowboarding and do things in the cold i like my lower back to be completely covered so snow or a breeze doesnt hit it but they are warm enough and the style other wise is good,1
this suit is amazing i didnt think i could get something so cute with quality at such a low price better than some expensive victoria secret bathing suit that has lower quality in fabric i got compliments at a pool party i hosted i never like wearing a bathing suit in public lol and this outfit made me feel pretty amazing the cut flatters my wide hips i could go on only so so part was that i had to order a small and a bottom to match my bottom and top size but its so cheap i didnt really care much about that bravo,2
like all things that pretend to be unisex and one size fits all these did not fit my womans face well,0
im not too crazy about the material i should have read the details a little better i really thought it would be more like a sweater havent even worn yet,1
it was too tight for me i have to give it to other person for free,0
the deckh mat straw lifegaurd hat wasnt as durable started breaking apart witching the month and the package it came in was squished just like the hat,0
its too stiff,1
this dress is very thin you will have to wear a slip with it,1
i gave this ring as a gift its petite and beautiful i would not hesitate to order anotheri loved it,2
this did not fit the wrist of person it was purchased for its cute wellmade with a strong magnetic clasp the picture presents it well the bracelet is light with the heaviness of the thicker metal clasp the person i ordered it for liked it it was just too small and due to how its made impossible to be worn on her wrist there is no stretch to it,1
do not bother they do not stay and the wing is too big,0
gloves are great quality comfortable and true to size they fit perfectly,2
thin lightweight material but feels good on the skin i sized up i am size s ordered size m but i feel like half size down would be perfect very prone to wrinkles deteriorating fast with washing,1
videoida599d8ca6fba9ef96e6104f64e483764 this is a very nice quality wallet it is dsigned to fit alot of items in a very small area it is well made it is easy to use it is lightweight it will hold cards cash and important items,2
fit was bad,1
works perferct it is small so it is hidden behind the broochpin unlike other larger converters,2
very comfortable i came back to buy more,2
it does not work for me,0
neat sophisticated classy the body fit perfectly but i needed to go up a cup,2
i love the idea of these but sometimes they are super uncomfortable to wear they are very difficult for me to use by myself and i almost always have to have my husband put them on for me,1
sucks dress shrunk after first wash,0
three sizes too small,1
these socks are very comfortablebr br they have wicking properties they are 99 polyester and have stretching propertiesbr br i found them a tad tight at the top so i folded them downbr br they have medium weight so they are good for cool summer days spring fall and warmer winter daysbr br although they are designed for athletics i like them for everyday wear to class and on errandsbr br im very happy with these socks they feel good on my feet,2
smaller than expected giving the size that was listed as 12 not really true to size,0
this set was cute the color was greatbr the top fit me great and i actually really liked itbr br however the pants were a problem the pants material was really thinbr could clearly see underwearbr br they also didnt really synch anything in you can see every bump and roll i had usually leggings kind of suck all that stuff inbr br i think if you are very fit and dont wear underpants these will look great but wasnt for me unfortunatelybr br had to return,1
very pretty just what i was looking for,2
good for a few uses than the stitching will fall apart after a few hand wash just very thin material,0
i have not taken this to the beach yet but i cannot wait to this skirt is simply amazing i am 56 and weigh 165 with large hips i got a large and it fits perfect with barely any velcro showing the length is great also and i think the longer one would be too much i liked it so much i went back and got another one in black to mix and match withbr br if you are looking for an easy and comfortable article of clothing to take to the pool or beach than this is for you i hope this helps everyone,2
not for big chested girls im a size large with d cups and the bodice was waaay to small plus it was sewn flat instead of curved so it made a weird wavy line and smooshed my boobs ugly instead of flattering i really really wanted to like this dress and it would look great if i had smaller boobs,1
the product that was delivered to us was a disaster it was way too small for the size we have purchased and one sleeve was smaller then the other wouldnt recommend buying this again,0
the good 1 fit is good 2 warm as heck almost too warmbr br the bad 1 fabric seems cheap pilling literally after one wearing espcially on the mock neck collar chaffing against neck whiskers 2 pilling even anywhere it chaffes the next layer 3 washing causes pilling 4br br the ugly 1 i dont think i would wear this as my intended under layer to my work even with our casual dress code looks too crappy around the neck and anywhere its not covered good for round the house and outdoor work and activities is about all too bad,0
very nice,2
good quality and nice colors but feel very tight around calves and i dont have heavy legs,1
muy buen producto,2
i hate wearing anything on my feet but i came across these at a local gift shop and feel in love,2
it was replaced and neither one of them fits on my phone right they are defective,0
fabric is thin and the color is more sage than kelly green which was very disappointing on the up side it has worked incredibly well as a slip for a couple other dresses i have i would not wear this on its own way way too thin,1
as far as looks materials couldnt ask for better ordered a lxl wear a 7 34 could not get it on my head stretch band had no give at all fit like 7 12 uncomfortable shame cause it looks so good,1
fits great love the toggles that i can adjust it does shrink some after washing the 1st time i have received compliments the mask fits my 7 yo my 12 yo and myself so its adjustable flexible because of the toggles and the fabric pleats,2
warm and fuzzy,2
i bought this for my granddaughter and she loved it she said it looked magical i liked that she could put it over her head and not have to undo it,2
diminutions of this bag exceed the 62 checked bag limit on sprit i will have to pay an extra 100,0
this suit was super cute and fit me well for the most part what i didnt like was that i felt like it wouldnt hold up in water and my boobs would slip out as soon as i turned my torso or laid in a pool float,1
i didnt like the quality cheap looking,0
tight around my hips and too long for my 5334 frame,1
these boots are indeed warm but dont know how long that will last as they shed feathers like a wet dog sheds hairbr all ove the ottoman on the bed on the floorthankful is does not smell like a wet dog as well,0
just received it the other day its a christmas present but disappointed with this item the green alien is supposed to be a neon green you barely see it on the sweatshirt i bought the matching leggings and they are so vibrant with the neon green it really doesnt match,0
nice for good price the snaps at the bottom fell apart i dont want to but i have to return it if they can improve the snaps its gonna five stars,0
great for that extra poof,2
not bad just not greatbr br im one of those guys for whom 32x32 always fits always have been and these fit but oddly the pants rise up on my waist somehow dont ask me how but the spouse immediately turned up her nosebr br 34something wrong with the cut34 she saidbr br the material is good quality though the 34never iron34 claim seems a bit hyperbolic the fold as packaged did not come out after wearing it for a day a quick swipe with an iron took care of thatbr br my ideal sizes tend to be slim and i guess this fit that but theres something amiss in the detail that would take a specialist to sort out the zipper seemed short not surebr br i will wear these and as business casual they will be perfectly suitablebr br just not when the spouse is likely to notice,1
i was pretty disappointed with this its way too small i am a medium ordered a large and it fits like a small i expected it to be flowy and open that was the whole reason why i bought it also the rose has different colored threads through out the design and looks cheap however the fabric is soft and cozy i was able to salvage it with cutting off the sleeves and neck to make it a tank top and well see if i actually wear it or give it to the salvation army,1
good looking watch but tried half the day to get the time set i followed the instructions but the time would not set i bought it for my mom who is blind but decided to return it when i couldnt get it to work right,1
ok,2
very pleased with the fit and comfort of this particular bra i havent tried other savage bras yet though i have a few more on my list this one has wide comfortable straps the cups were smooth and fit perfectly without overflow the band is sturdy and helps smooth any less than smooth areas you may be unhappy with though its not going to do the kind of work that a longline bra would for instance its just a nice quality sleek tshirt bra and im hoping it will stand the test of time but for now im happy that its gone through the wash a few times without issue and is still comfortable and not losing any elasticity in the band or fit in the cups,2
they were darker than some others i like tht,2
pants did not fit i bought a 38x32 and it says 38x32 on the tag measured the pant and they are 34 inches waist now i am going to have tkfool with sending them back sooo disappointed,0
rubber too hard,1
i gave it 2 stars because it has rainbow dash on it and its purple other then that i do regret this purchase poor quality shirt decal looked faded you can see the seams its very thin definitely not worth the money,0
these are nice basic shirts but they are no warmer than regular ones that are not marketed as thermal,1
really nice great for any poe fan,2
great style but size runs small on me and the black fabric was too shiny for me reluctantly returned,0
i could have made this myself and probably should have its just elastic band and hooks,1
i have only worn my new copper fit compression socks for the past two days so far i like them they are comfortable to wear they are fairly easy to get on and off when following the instructions they fit nicely i have had trouble with store bought compression socks not fitting on my foot properly and being too long in the toe to heel area i like that the toe seam does not irritate the top of my toes the only thing i do not like is the padded area beneath my toes it causes the toe area to feel like it bunches up a bit overall i like the sock,2
looks like the picture runs a bit small didnt realize it was just a long sleeved t with a hood not thick at all this is not a sweatshirts bought for an 8 year old about 60lbs,1
this jacket by marmot is both lightweight and warm it is true to size and looks great the surface is easy to wipe down if it gets dirty but i threw it in the washing machine and was pleased with the result after allowing it to air dry,2
it is a very cute outfit but i feel like the straps are a little on the long side i also wish it had snaps at the bottom to make diaper changing less of a challenge,1
excellent,2
this is my second copy of this shirt because my last one was stolen while i was flaying in the snake river ps im sure willie would agree that stealing is very not nice glad that i was able to replace because i really love how soft the material is,2
i had to pay for shipping so i bought two shirts i ordered a size up from usual following amazon recommendations this was a mistake and i feel mislead the shirts appear to be an athletic fit online not so in real life they are way too big if youre looking for a fitted shirt this is not the one for you,0
i ordered these in beige and dark gray i am honestly not sure if they are cotton but at least they have very little chemical odor as compared with the ones that i bought from another vendor the beige ones are generously sized and plenty big for womens hands probably too big for girls hands the gray ones on the other hand no pun intended are smaller and they have less stretch to them there were a few quality control issues stitching that went all the way through the mitten and a loose yard end but nothing major id say size variation is the biggest concern also the gray ones are just not as well made as the beige ones so id say that you will need to be aware that quality will vary from pair to pair the fur on the gray pair is shedding a little and i can see where the sides of the fur fabric will need to be stitched and reinforced the eyes on the gray ones are also spaced apart more ive ordered multiples of these mittens so i can give as gifts based on size i would strongly advise that before you give these as gifts you inspect them and fix what needs to be fixed with a needle and thread if its possible otherwise return them i love that these have a thick sweater style knit cute faces and fur and a warm white fleece lining my daughter age 22 had no interest in them though oh well these are great walking mittens but not in a snowstorm,2
the shirt is very big wide and sleeve length for the size it is the accessories though are nice and a good start set for a tuxedo,1
i love it but my wife hates it it is not tshirt material,0
videoid2a8d5ee3e4cf2f23a364208ea255e87 i was really disappointed it broke right way as i took it out of the package didnt get to wear them,0
kiwi sneaker cleaner is something you definitely need to be on top of when you first purchase your shoes i used this on a pair of snow boots that were gently used and they got marginally cleanbr br what you get is a cleaner with a plastic mesh like sponge on the top you squeeze the cleaner out and clean your shoe i suggest wiping off as much dirt and mud as possible before using this after you use the cleaner wait for a few minutes and then with a damp cloth wipe it off the white parts will not be white as they were when you bought your shoes but they will be clean this is a good cleaner if you arent too rough on your shoes however no matter how hard i try my shoes end up extremely dirty scuffed and utterly destroyed usually thanks to other people who for some reason dont see a 510 very large woman standing nearby so this isnt going to put my shoes back to when i first took them out of the box however if you are the opposite of me then this will should work well for you as for me my shoes wont look too ragged but this is not my solution to keeping my shoes pristine,1
shoes are so sexy i wore them for halloween the only downfall is i cant stand in them for very long because they hurt my feet totally need more padding but still a good product for what i used the for,1
super cute the only thing is that they do give a camel toe but that doesnt really bother me also i ordered a large and they do scrunch a bit in the crotch area so stick to your normal size,2
very tiny,1
after i washed it a few times the letters began to crack i still wear it though,2
protect your neck keeps my neck warm during the cold,2
great fit fast delivery very happy,2
i like it but be warned the mask might be upside down from where the bendy part is,1
amazing,1
for the price tag i feel like the quality is fine i own quite a few lularoe leggings and unfortunately these just miss the mark for me while incredibly soft and comfortable they felt thinner and of a lesser quality also they just didnt have the right fit on me i am 5234 and 180lbs a size 1618 and the leggings went up to my braline and bunched in various areas on my legs maybe i would have been better in the onesize for this brand the thing that i love about llr leggings is the yogastyle waistband under tighter fitted tops you dont see much of the silhouette of the muffin top that occurs with a smaller band typical of most leggings like i mentioned theyre fine for the price tag but ill stick with paying more to get the look fit and comfort that i have with the 34other34 brand,1
i work in a water utility field and proper and comfortable wear is very important i would definitely purchase again,2
these are super cute but tarnished really bad after one wear to the beach,1
love everything about this sweater,2
the kidney belt velcro had both sides the hook velcro rather than one side being loop velcro and on side being hook velcro so it wouldnt stay secured rivets didnt look to me like they would last but for the money its not a bad value typical of chinese made products,0
this is a bit thick and that is ok the issue it the bulky seem in the middle,1
comfy could wear these slippers all day long,2
i bought them as a gift for me peridot is my charm stone i wore them each time i am in or out and each time when ive got nice comments from others i appreciate the value of shopping with amazon gem stone king is my best shop fulfilled by amazon this is not my first time i bought jewelry from them thanks,2
this is a very thin hoodie,1
great but i always end up with upside down crosses always flipping,2
i opened the pkg and it was so small i doubt it would fit an infant not for adultsor even children,0
being returned the reindeer was literally not attached just lying on the top of the shirt bag when i opened it,0
these gloves ran small and the seams ripped almost instantly i would have complained but i do not want a replacement,0
beautiful pair of earrings highly polished silver sit well on either side pearl to the front or to the back a bit on the heavy side for earrings but so worth it gorgeous careful with the thin part it is very malleable,2
shame i would have kept this ironically it has a smell me sticker on it i was hoping it would air out but it instead it plagued my entire apt i have left it out for more than 7 days now and the scent is still incredibly strong,0
i cleaned them and the colors came off i didnt even clean them with alcohol i cleaned them with soap and water and they basically became almost clear just a little bit of color remained they are nice if you plan to never clean them,0
nice but not cotton fots a bit small even the largest size they had a available,1
do not waste your money cheaply made does not look anything like the photo,0
these ride up br i think cotton is way more comfortable,0
sleep bras are perfect for any type of situation however they need to be fed it right,2
lo compre para disfrazar a mi perro,2
top fits great bottoms really tight on the thighs and my waist is much larger than my legs lol ordered a medium 34d wear a size 7 pants normally,1
scratchy heavy fabric i prefer to wear soft and light tshirts its ok,1
would not buy again,0
i got my pair in mid april of this year and have worn them over the summer and now just past the 90day period for the warranty all of a sudden i cant fit my feet into them they shrunk they seriously shrunk from a size 10 to like a size 6 looks like im out some shoes and the neighbor girl just got some new play shoes dont buy,0
the stitching on these are so poor that they came apart within one weeks use at particular seams im suspecting that these were irregular items that couldnt make the quality control standards of brick and mortar stores avoid you were warned,0
gaping holes right in the front what do i do about them i love the material nice and thick but i cant wear it like that,2
have to double wrap the hair tie which stretches it out,0
for tiny little people,1
its cute comfy but the colors arent as bold as the photo suggests,1
small flashy bright hard to pin on shirt as they attach with only a small safety pin,1
use as house slippers comfortable durable,2
fit as expected and looks nice on,2
sparkling studs make a nice gift they hold upwell to wear very pleased with the colors with the exception of the redruby which was washed out,2
fake reviews this bag is not worth 30 flimsy cheap and small thank you amazon for refunding my money,0
i like the style of this shirt and the fabric is very soft but after a few washings the fabric is showing wear and the surface has developed those annoying little lint balls i only air dry after washing so this fabric should hold up better im disappointed china manufactured fabricclothing tends to be cheap,0
i really wanted this dress to fit but it was unflattering the sleeves and chest area definitely run small material has no stretch,0
i bought two of these one with amethyst stones and the other with garnet both had a decent amount of beads and looked sturdybr the amethyst one came with the clasp not properly closing and the chain itself was knotted note to seller dont send if the clasp isnt closing properly clasps arent that expensive,1
good looking hat well made and good price no complaint,2
i normally like clarks but these were a little stiff and the ankle area was too big,1
the image was distorted bad quality,0
very comfortable the pants were a bit snug but pajamas should be worn loose so i ordered the wrong size still great,2
cute tshirt,2
just received it and the color is not as shown in the picture i ordered quotstonequot but the purse is greysilver other than being disappointed about the color i like the rest of the bag the strap is easily adjustable side pockets fit standard size water bottles lots of interior room for phonewalletsweater and the exterior appears that it would wipe clean easily i cant comment on the durability only time will tell the quality,2
i live the soft leather very good quality little shoes i bought ahead of time my babes little foot just isnt big enough just yet,2
i was not happy with its fit,0
great,2
i plan to use this bag when i travel it has pocket and many places to place items at handy access you could carry a laptop in this purse and still have room for an overnight sleepover for your personal items i would recommend this bag very highlyit is a very big purse one who works are has to carry a lot of items for work or travel it would be perfect the leather is soft but the bag its self is heavy so with items in it makes for a heavy purse,1
cute but one month of wear and the top came unglued from the sole hardly any wear on the sole not worth the investment,0
by far these are super comfy except the souls melted in 93 degree heat a stone came through the soul and gave me a very nasty blister they would make great house shoes otherwise stay clear,0
runs small in this color for some reason,0
it broke,0
the title says waterproof but water resistant is more accurate they are comfortable and lightweight,2
ok so im a size 14 but still want to look and feel good on vacay this is the suit sexy yet covers and sits perfectly on your bad spots it is made of a really nice material and looks just like the one pictured oh yeah i ordered an xl and it is perfect,2
granddaughter loves it,2
i love how comfortable this bra is super sticky and the price was perfect must have strapless bra,2
these earrings are very prettybut thats all they have going for them beside being extremely difficult to fasten these earrings made my ears infected after only a few hours of wearing them my ears are now red and sore and i have a horrible headache please save your money and dont buy these,0
worth the money,1
sleeves were too tight and i could not raise my arms comfortably at all also didnt care for the look on me will be returning,0
very beautiful but way super longgot 5 inch heels and hoping to actually wear itits just too pretty not to,1
i left it by back door entrance a day after i got them next day it shrunk to like size 5 size 10 i bought,0
ripped in the washer after two washes but it did keep me warm and fit well,0
i ordered the shirt in a 3x and it came in as a large marked 3x cool graphics though,0
its a really pretty dress i was hesitant to buy this because of the reviews the dress is super short i have to wear tights and a cardigan its tight on the shoulders and chest area i love it but its not super comfortable ill keep wearing it though ill post better pics soon to help anyone out that is on the fence about this i ordered an xl,1
very squishy feel when walking without support makes it difficult to get any momentum i got them for walking and am disappointed,0
very poor quality not recommended,0
this show is supposed to be non slip and i am sliding all over the place also it is higher up on ankle than it appears in photo,0
fits great and looks great on my husband he is very happy with the coat and it is very warm too bad i bought it at the end of winter and he has been only able to wear it a few times the hood is big enough that the fur kept flopping in his face to where he couldnt see that had to go right away it snaps off and is just what he wanted,2
this shirt is fairly thin its almost see through cut and size is nice but wish material was thicker,1
tight on the for head,1
works great sturdy design and looks good,2
these tights fit well i like the grips on the bottom as well,2
these boots are comfy at ankles due to the elastic band they also come with a medium weight sock to allow more comfort anyplace the boot plastic rubs against skinankles etc im a medium width and found them to be narrow but for the im keeping them,2
good kids gi our daughter loves it it holds up great,2
i have spent sometimes over a hundred dollars on a good back pack but this is a fraction of the price of my other bags and yet in my opinion is superior in many ways it holds a lot of weight and yet itself weighs hardly anything it allows wet clothing to dry out it is sturdy and durable and yet has a very nice appearance anyone who is a student or even for those who purchase groceries will really appreciate this very well made back pack,2
expected the memory foam to be a bit firmer i would listen to other reviewers and order a size up overall not bad for price,1
too small,0
im too old for these first of all they are so big around 3 in diameter its not my taste im not returning them too much trouble how i wish i understood their size because if they were half their size i might quite like them,1
bought this as a gift for my lady out of state the shirt arrived with a hole in the collar the size of her pinky finger,0
the bag smells the size doesnt match the description terrible quality i wouldnt even pay 5 for this bag,0
i ordered these shoes in black and fell in love with them they are beautiful and sexy but they hurt my feet so bad the straps by the toes starting cutting into my feet almost immediately i realize that this might not be the case for every person but if you have wider feet i would not recommend,0
love the style and comfort but its too small even at an xxl im a 38d going to return and order xxxl,1
love these socks and will probably purchase more they are very comfortable and last a long time this is my 3rd time purchasing them i have also purchased them as a gift for my sister we have small feet and so this size fits perfectly i love how they come in black and in white,2
ehh save your money i ordered a small and it goes too high up in the front and was very long and you cant wear underwear with it now its sitting in my closet and il never wear it i am 52 120lbs,0
poorly made it doesnt hang off your shoulder,0
great shirt quality is top notch fits snug but not too tight and love the design not cheap material even though the price is,2
the hat is very useful in blocking out the suns harmful rays but it keeps flying off in the wind the inner part that sits on my head is too small and i cant keep it snugly fit my heads not extraordinarily large i have not read any other reviews since i bought this last summer so i dont know if this is a common characteristic of this hat or if it was just my luck to get a defective hat in any case ive tossed this in the wash with my daughters baby clothesie gentle cycle and it has come out okay i airdried itits just a wee bit floppier than it was before but that does not detract from its function id give it three and a half stars if i could but since i cant the three sticks remaining comfortably on my head is an important characteristic to have in a sunhat,1
it looks nothing like the picture is very dull and cheap,0
works for what i wanted but other people said it ran small and they mustve corrected themselves by then ok quality,1
the fabric is poor quality and looks terrible after a few washes the fabric also picks up and holds onto lint pet hair etc these have been quickly religated to at home comfy pants only,0
they hold an incredible amount of groceries probably at least 2x what the plastic bags at the grocery hold good strong material i love these,2
really like this bag comfortable over or under a jacket holds all my essentials multiple pockets of different shapes and sizes for organization easy to access my stuff used it on our family vacation and seems very durable and wellmade 1010 would buy again,2
image is very yellow its ok but could have done better with a lighter color and then flesh tones we loved rey not sure why she isnt better depicted,1
concept is great but the cap is deformed where it is sowned,1
the blouse was adorable on but was so flimsy that when i touched a barely warm iron to it to get the wrinkles out it melted,1
very well made thumbs up also was on the daily special at a reduced price happy happy great quality,2
,0
material was rubbery and extremely difficult to put on not too mention it was very uncomfortable can you imagine wearing that in the hot summer month did not stay up when i sat down it would roll down past my belly,0
these are pretty comfortable and stretchy i use to breastfeed just pull up the pads move around quite a bit and they dont provide much support but my biggest complaint is that the straps always feel like they are about to fall off my shoulders they are just made too widefar apart im a big lady so my shoulders are larger than average,1
bought this thinking it would fit my bible but it didnt love the look of it but i just wish it fit i purposely bought this one because it was slightly larger than the dimensions of my bible which are 10 x 73 x 2 but to my surprise it didnt fit,1
ive been wearing these for years and think theyre terrific,2
the quality is okay but this fit way too small ordered an extra large and i would say it fit more like a medium on my husband who is not a very portly guy id recommend ordering up a size or two,1
this ring is definitely chunky which is nice if you want to show off your jewelry i did find the 14k color to be a little too yellow im not sure if i thought this because some of my other gold jewelry is a little less garish i love gold jewelry but i have to be careful what i pair this ring with i tend to wear it alone as it doesnt match my other gold accessories i like it on its own though its a pretty ring,1
the elastic orange bands that go across the shoe dont actually do anything and with a 2 yr old he likes to stretch them out and theres no way to retighten them otherwise they fit well and he enjoys wearing them,1
too big for my bracelet does not 34stop34 other charms,0
meh i love the color but i feel like i need to loose weight to make it work im not usually that type of thinker but its a beautiful color just maybe the shape thats meh,1
im 52 25 waist ordered extra small fit true to size they are soft and comfy however they look more like a yoga pant than a dress pant and are a little bit seethrough i would say these are not office appropriate unless you wear a long enough top to cover your ass properly so other people dont see things they dont wanna see i was hoping the material would be a little thicker however i will be keeping them an adding them to my yoga pant collection,1
the backpack is super cute it seems decent as far as quality goes the straps are my lease favorite part instead of a full faux leather strap it has a weird backing on the back of the straps it seems like some sort of nylon,2
absolutely no support,0
great price its a slick material that feels nice,2
do not buy this it is not 316l or stainless like stated a day after i put it in my nose became incredibly sore tender it began to completely rust,0
these are cute and very light weight they run a little bit small after wearing them around the house for 10min the light blue tag in the back of the shoe started to bother me i tried a few time now hoping they would break in a bit but it still bothers me now they are collecting dust,1
loved the color and drapingfit unfortunately the material quality is crap and started to unravel after the first washing didnt last long enough to actually get much use out of,0
cute and comfy fit well around my body,2
it was a struggle to put together the instructions are not very helpful looks to be used already all it does when you plug it in it makes this quiet weird static radio noise and the adapter got kinda hot quickly it does nothing else closeoutsp i believe is a place where they sell returned items broken items will try and fix it i think the wires are shorting out somehow ive never seen this before on any animatronic so going to try my best to fix the problem then maybe ill change the ratingbr br update returned for a new onebr apr 29 2022 got refunded full amount because there was none left dont buy this item,0
so annoying honestly the zipper comes down every three seconds cheap,0
i bought them for a present and the person was happy with themx xx x x x x xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xx,1
i dont have wide feet nor do i have fat feet but these shoes as cute as they are were just so undersized and awkward there isnt enough room for your foot it feels so flat in the shoe box i wear a 75 and returned because they were too shortsmall purchased an 8 and not much difference at all still small and very hard to get on your feet i was bummed because they truly are so so cute snd just what i was looking for i am not going to continue trying sizes because twice was enough and i missed the opportunity to wear them for an event i needed them for id say a whole size bigger than what you wear at the minimumbut again a struggle for me to get my foot into,1
nice and sturdy,2
im so impressed with these for so many reasons theyre light they breathe well they have carbon injected soles that give the right amount of rigidity the boa clasp makes all the difference i was worried the cable might break but after using them for a few hundred miles i doubt it they look very narrow but actually arentbr br i only wish they made regular shoes lol,2
cute but the fit was a little off and the quality was way cheaper than i expected,0
liked the style but the quality of material not so much,1
they have more grip then i want but are good shoes,2
es super trasparente,0
zippers on the sleepers are cheap and broke within the first use,0
my wrists are not enormous i wear average sized jewelry for women unless you have child sizes wrists this will not fit it had two snaps but this barely got my 12yr old who is 54 and 118 lbs,0
the most uncomfortable bra i think ive ever worn the underwire dug into my armpits so bad i had red marks the next day returning asap,0
cute boots but feel apart after just 4 months,0
a bit smaller than expected,2
a bit large,1
nice quality,2
these are a nice size earring they dont hurt my ears and ive had a lot of compliments on them great choice but never disappointed with montana silversmiths,2
extremely see through and shows every crease used for a halloween winnie the pooh costume i had to wear maternity leggings underneath,0
very thin material,0
i ordered my normal size but is was so small that i couldnt even get the zipper to fit together that is unbelievable i exchanged for two sizes up hoping ill at least be able to close it this time fingers crossed because it seems to be a decent bra,1
very disappointed in this purse,0
the ring fell off,1
they are comfortable but flimsy and it makes them hard to slipon the heel portion just collapses at the slightest pressure and the tongue too easily slips down into the shoe as you slip your foot in,1
i didnt notice it said st louis but thats the reason its so cheap item didnt fit as expected was almost 2 sizes to small,1
the hat arrived early but unfortunately is rather small it was advertised as one size fits all but is a smallmedium it barely fits and is tight on my head other than that it is not a bad product,0
my grandson loves them and always wants them on i love the construction of them and how well they fit would buy these again,2
this fit was not for me it was not baggy enough,0
cute but most of them had holes after the first wear,0
excellent product works as suppose to is excellent quality looks very nice thank you,2
great camo pattern and the delivery time from the uk was quite quick the pants fit as expected are comfortable and excellent for working around the house in,2
i tried both large recommended for my size and medium and both do not offer enough support for high impact workout,0
the quality is terrible its way too thin and the seams are not only uneven but coming apart straight out of the bag i tried to return it but they said theyd get me return info and never responded to me again so im stuck with it,0
aunt loved it,2
not for my body type,1
leaves a weird dark stain on skin after wearing even after washing,1
i had originally gotten one and it broke as i put it on the metal snapped on my scalp and it hurt pretty bad contacted the seller and they sent me a replacement but the same thing happenedbr br not worth it,0
these did not stay tied and stretched out after only a few weeks of wear will not buy again,1
i wanted to keep this but the armpits are oddly cut and when you lift your arms it messes with the whole look of the dress the rest of the dress tailored waist and nice skirt is very flattering maybe i just have small arms and rib cage sadly i must return,1
way too small i returned it,0
its actually prettier than the photos show i havent had the chance to use it yet to go to the pool my 3 yr old granddaughter loves to play with it,2
too high,0
great,2
get atleast 2 sizes bigger than what you normally wear fits and feels weird around waist very compressing around chest so if youre a bustier woman i do not recommend not lightweight at all compared to other grooming clothes decent warmth quality for winter but i imagine this would be very hot in summer,1
cheaply made doesnt keep the shape after one wear,1
the largest size available fits as a small the elastic is inadequate for its intended purpose it is too tight and will not stay on the shoulders if you intend to move at all it is so tight that when it snaps up from the shoulders it hits you in the throat its extermemly uncomfortable the only way to wear this garmet is if you are petite and wear it with a large wide belt that will hold the shirt where it is intended to be the shirt will not stay there on its own it only fit the most petite person in my home and although everyone thought the shirt was cute no one could wear it longer than to try it on except for the neckline it fit everyone if you purchase this item do so with the knowledge that you will have to remove the elastic in the neck and replace it the style was cute and the length was good both sleeve length and 34dress34 length but i would recommend that you continue looking for this style this item will not make you happy,0
pinched at the toes,1
it runs on the small side very small side,0
this is my toddlers second pair of sparkle crocs she loves them and so do i they go with everything wash off easily with a baby wipe or soap and water in the sink the sparkles do not fall off and only show wear after months of nonstop wear and that is not even noticeable because the shoe is grey so if there is a small area that gets rubbed free of sparkle it is ok they go from the playground to the beach i cannot say enough for the durability and wearability the do run about a size large but with the strap on the back it stays on the foot and they get more wear out of the shoe,2
this was definitely a splurge its expensive but worth it with the quality great gift and very attractive,2
these were nice shoes which i immediately returned without wearing them so my impressions are simply first impressions from trying them on i would not call them lightweight nor breathable the feel more like hiking boots than walking shoes they are certainly sturdy and well made,1
nice quality but the front flap is not quite long enough for a samsung note 10 very sad,1
if i bought this again i would buy a size down it fits comfortably but it slides down a bit so i would buy it a bit tighter,2
they definitely start to slide off of your hips and create a weird space in between your legs,1
love these earrings the posts are a bit thicker than my earholes so i put a little vaseline on them the first time i wore them to get them to slide in easier after that they have been perfect since,2
ok,1
great pull over fleece always comfortable and warm love it for long days fishing steelhead,2
your truly have to order one 2 or 3 times large than regularbr br its durable and dries quickly,2
at first glance this looked like a cute dress but the material was thick and the seam under the bust was very very tight the polka dots did not line up where the seams were and that made the dress look silly and cheap it might have been cute in a solid color if it was sized properly,0
very cheap,0
the samsung galaxy gear charm was light weight and not obviously a tracker which is what i was looking for but i have doubts about its step count accuracy doesnt matter now because it fell off my wrist last night and is long gone,1
good backpack for the cost right size for what we need only downfall is that the strap is coming unstitched from the bottom of the bag after only several uses with very little weight in the back,1
great robe very warm,2
wasnt what i expectedvery disapointedon the picture it looks cute but when i got the shirtthe sleeves were too wide and its not off the shoulder,0
if you want a pretty digital watch buy it the mother of purl dial really does look nice and the band is very comfortable problem is that the watch comes with an instruction book that doesnt include digital watches i looked all over the internet for instructions and cant find them on the tommy or molvado sites i have tried many combinations of buttons and think at this point that the buttons do not work correctly and that is why they dont include instructions defective watch still being sold at real prices at least it is a little cheaper on amazon than it is in the stores i was able to set the time but the date and alarm functions dont work im returning it,0
it was really pretty just too small in shoulders and arms,1
good look steel toe a little uncomfortable,1
received this for my birthday in february waited til yesterday to wear it when i visit my niece who gave it to me well it broke today i feel sad that she spent 2994 thinking she was helping someone in kenya i wonder what fraction that woman received,0
very nice,2
one out of four was a bit too small they were all a bit too clingy for my 64 year old body great colors and really soft loved the length would be good for a woman younger than me,0
during this covid time i saw this as the perfect answer to not losing and constantly looking for her childrens masks put it on in the morning and it then doesnt come off till the end of the day i bought a set of a boys design which my nephew loved,2
bought as gift for mother arrived when expectedgood value,2
they are super soft and comfortable however they arent warm they are very thin,1
there were no pockets and the product description did not mention that who buys or makes mens shorts without pockets,0
had to return,0
no back light like thepicture shows feels cheap but it does keep time well enough,1
i ordered thinking it would be a little big but it was almost too small it is a very lovely dress but will not be able to wash it think it may be really too small then will order larger size next time thanks,1
too small gave them to my daughter they look great on her,1
the ring is beautiful and i love that shape in fact i spent more for this thinner version than my previous one just because it looks more elegant the reason for not giving 5stars is because the first time i went swimming it got dark from the chlorine while my other silver ring necklace and earrings did not i did fix it with vinegar and baking soda but it still does not look exactly like before and now i have to take it off every time,1
the back of the slipper came undone at the seam poor quality dont buy these,0
coat is not as long as showed in pictures and sleeves are insanely large poorly made,0
really cute but attracts hair easily,2
this was not worth the made really cheap it is loose falls off my wrist all the time next time i drop it i wont pick it up,0
this runs very small particularly in chest area,0
the legs arent snug so they flare out a bit which looks weird,1
excellent,2
cheaply made wouldnt buy again,0
not the best fit or quality but cute message,1
these shorts look awful on me i like the style tho just not on me i dont care for the material at all look cheap shiny silk look,0
thin material doesnt stay up on my nose well it doesnt have double stitching on the ends like many others do its ok if you can get it cheap but dont expect much it does look half way decent,1
great product would buy again,2
it is for sure counterfeit i am keeping mine anyway to wear with jeans but the fabric is not at all nice anne klein would cringe i think amazon should do a better job with screening next time i will buy from nordstrom update i am still annoyed that amazon doesnt screen for knockoffs every time i see the jacket i fume over being suckeredbr update much later i am unable to understand howwhy this flawed garment receives so many good reviews has any of these reviewers ever actually bought a valid anne klein coat how could anyone fail to notice the cheap rough wrinkly foulsmelling fabric in this garment the toosmall button holes the hideous brown buttons the cheap lining mine actually fits well but i would never wear such a shoddy jacket with anything other than jeansbr i believe amazon may be making a severe tactical error in allowing counterfeit goods on the site loyal customers are being driven to nordstrom or macys where we dont get the shaft,0
beautiful shades and came in great condition for me personally they were very tight so i gave them to my niece,1
i am retired military retired state peace officer have worn under armour boots for years thier quality has definitely degraded sides of boot are baggy and my 4 prior pair were all waterproof these are not they rub at the high ankle so thick socks are a must wish they would sell the same quality they had 5 years ago,1
this dress is super cute but as soon as you try it on youll realize its cheap foreign made crap like most garments made overseas there is no attention to fit it gapes hugely at the chest if you want your entire chest to show this is the dress for you if not dont waste your money,0
shirt was as described unfortunately i returned it as there was a cuthole on the back near the neckline and it runs a little small,1
sooooo small almost youth sized,0
yeah so great concept really poor execution for starters trying to set to the thread and set the pins in place were a pain they came with 2 tiny wooden picks inside the threads were the pins would go i quickly realized i should have left those in when running the pins in between the threads because it was annoying yet the first absolute worst part was trying to get the pins set in place to the actual watch which definitely took a minute once its all in place actually connecting the 2 ends together got to be so frustrating difficult i just quit wearing it and i didnt even make it a week i got tired of fighting with it for several minutes plus i didnt want to continue to not take it off because i was dreading putting it back on it was such a pain in the i should have listened to other reviews that said the same thing dont be an idiot like myself keep scrolling and pick another band,0
i liked that this mermaids hair color matches mine but she had some holes on the back of her tail that i just couldnt get past her body was also flat so when she was at an angle her face looked strange and you couldnt really tell that it was supposed to be face shaped unfortunately i had to return it,1
i ordered these pajama pants for my husband to wear to our christmas eve pajama morning tradition we have every year i ordered a large and unfortunately they fit more like a medium was unable to wear,0
videoid917274649ce2bd3d21ce1b0e547f906b the watch is very cool and looks very real it looks even better in real life than in the pictures it shines even in dim lighting and im the envy of all of my friends now this is worth the money,2
i like it and very comfortable color was nice and bright,2
great,2
runs small in size,1
i like the materialeasy to breathe even though layers it covers the whole of an adults face filters ok too so far sturdy with good stitchingbr not so great is the thickness of the earloops they can be uncomfortable also there is no nose clip,1
short sleeves go lower then my work uniform short sleeve shirt,1
the style is good but they picked the wrong material to make it with the material is too light weight and prone to retaining wrinkles,1
works great,2
giotto joke this is a chinese product with chinese lettering all over the packaging and the price tag in yuan giotto translates to 34cituo34 which is boldly written on the shoe and makes it feel cheap will be returning,0
this dress is beautiful it is well made and the design doesnt fold in on itself like a lot of similar ones do with the cut out parts it fits beautifully and every time i wear t i get a dozen compliments on it,2
low quality glasses for high priced cost,0
i was very upset to see this white stitching on both of the black hoodiesbr it makes no since to stitch labels that big with white for over 50 each you would expect betterbr so i dont even know if i want them replaced,0
exactly what it states it is not a piece of junk,2
this is a really cute jean jacket and fits well my daughter doesnt love to wear it so im not sure if its not as comfortable as her other jackets but i think its adorable,2
nothing special about them,0
a smidge to short,1
3332 fits perfect,2
i applied this to new 200 medium brown boots they are now black i dont care about the color change just know it can turn leather not suede blackbr its a thick sticky oil i bet its a great waterproofing smells like a camp fire when applying pine tar so it must be good rightbr did i mention my boots are black now,0
i received this bag as a present and i love it very well made it seems to be a strong bag with lots of room insidebr glad i placed it on my wish list,2
love the fabric but the cut is a little off the waist fits nice but the arms are tight i ordered a small that has been fitting fine but i think a medium would be too big and the pocket ruins the flow,1
i bought these socks because i thought they looked good i would not have believed that they could give me a day free of any thought about whats happening below my knees give these a try i am certain you will be as surprised as i am i will be ordering another couple of pairsi will definitely recommend give a try to this compression socks by compressiondrif you found my review helpful please click yes,2
pretty shade of seashell pink the faux leather looks fine probably it wont bother you that theres stitching down the front bringing the two side pieces together but its there just fyi otherwise its like the picturea flat pretty wide brim and a bit more than half that is pink mesh its comfortable because the band in the back is adjustable pink plastic band with holes that moves over another pink plastic band with small pink plastic 34pegs34 on the back of the mesh in black embroidery is 34about last night34 which seems completely unnecessary to me and black on pink doesnt even look good plus a black embroidered 34splotch34 that i guess is their logo but looks ugly to me so ugly i dropped off a star but maybe it appeals to other people i dont see why the company thought it would look good to have a big black 34ink splotch34 on the back of a pink cap or so it looks to me its comfortable but i wouldnt have the lettering or the logo br ground fabric 90 polyesterbr 7 cotton 3 other fiberbr coating polyurethanebr back panel 100 polyesterbr visor lining 100 cottonbr exclusive of decoration,1
turns your skin green the color turns from silver to a rusted color in just a couple of days not worth it at all,0
great quality bag sturdy i was able to iron logos into them for my boys soccer teams they held up well and didnt melt like i was afraid they might good size sturdy straps highly recommend,2
i was very disappointed with these they r just like wearing sweaters on your legs and do not hold u in at all i was looking for something with a little bit of support and these are not them not even a 1 star but had to put something,0
this belt is not 100 leather like that they stated buyer beware the backside of it is vinyl,0
i love wearing girlie girl tshirts i have many of them short and long sleeve ones i usually wear a size large but when the fabric is listed as 100 cotton i usually order the next size up incase of shrinkage the shirts wash up well and i hang mine up to dry instead of putting them in the dryer the shirts are usually true to size,2
these gloves hold up to the abuse of a guy who will dive straight into engine repairs while wearing his driving gloves the insulation is perfect both for freezing winter evenings and crisp fall days the comfort and sizing is spot on as is the weight of the leather the stitching is quite remarkable i have used gloves in a similar price range which suffer from thin patches or improperly gusseted joints this pair exhibits none of these issues,2
this shirt was soft and high quality the shirt has stretch to it but is clingy and runs small,1
both the brown and gray are not solid but heatheredtextured which makes them too casual looking for work have to return and look for an alternative frustrating,0
tight around the thighs eventhoug i bought 1 size bigger,0
i liked the feel on the nose the nose not sore anymore very comfortable,2
it was a gift for deployed soldiers through 34soldiers angels i will assume these socks fit well,2
i like them but was somewhat disappointed also last year i purchased some cuddle dud supersoft socks in dark colors i just love them i guess i thought these would be the same these are very thin ill wear them but if you ever offer the supersoft ones in white i would love to know,1
love this dress have gotten so many compliments on it,2
just like pictures and sizing is great she will be able to use it for a long time,2
very skimpy crop shirt tight at chest and shows alot of cleavage better for thin small chested women it is a cute shirt wish it was longer on top and bottom for reference im a size lg shirt and c cup,0
i think these socks are great for little cross country runners but as a older woman who occasionally jogs i have heavier calves and ankles and these are a bit tight around the ankles for me so i would definitely not older them again for myself but i think younger slimmer runners would enjoy them they provide light compression to the foot that feels quite nice and stay just above the shoe top to prevent blisters,2
i love it its perfect for me and my fiance,2
fits all my cards in a slim solution,2
i bought this for my daughter because she wanted it for school but her teachers suspended her just for wearing it,1
too small,2
the dress was not what i expected to be but will pass it on to my daughter for a birthday present,1
i liked the look of this bracelet from its pics the actual product was poorly made the holes in some of the chips werent placed properly so some of the chips were sticking out and in less than a week the bracelet burst it was a very disappointing purchase from this seller i always purchase stuff from this seller and have never encountered any problems before,0
it was even better than i expected adorable sexy flattering and super comfy and soft true to size,2
ive never spent so much on underwear but i am so glad i did they instantly became my favorite new undies they are super comfortable and have that plainsimple look i prefer i definitely plan on buying more in different colors,2
not for eyebrow by the angle of the hand ball closure not for lip,0
very comfy i normally wear large and the medium fit great i hace a small waist and big hips and rhe dress wasnt fitted so it went straight to my hips and i looked like a brick i returned it but would have kept it if my body didnt look so weird in it,1
bought this as a mothers day gift for my adult sisters and they loved it super cute expandable size fits well,2
awful,0
not the best very thin and came in extremely wrinkled hard to get the wrinkles out also,1
nice quality,2
expected a better quality product but it is still good looks and feels and fits ok,1
i would have given a better score but one pair was unraveled on the hem i bought them to wear not to have to sew them myself they are comfortable material is good but the stitching on the is not good,1
no stretch if larger than size 5 you look like a whale in it i got it for a wedding and i cried cause i couldnt find anything else,0
the boot is comfortable thought it would fit like a keen boot but not quite as good,1
so fun my 6 year old is a skinny kid so it is a pain keeping from falling down he loves it though,2
low quality material,1
the bigger ball is odious very unattractive in my ear the only way i would wear these is just with the smaller balls both just looks like they threw the rhinestones on,0
great product with one major flaw the bottoms get slick very fast would much rather they have some sort of grippy surface,1
the coach shoes were very affordable and the fit was perfect as well,2
well made durable,2
band was super cute and i loved the color however one end was messed up and wouldnt slide into my watch face i was really impressed with the quality but i obviously couldnt use it so i sent it back,0
love them,2
soft and not too big,2
cheaply made sleeve cuff seams fell out after one time wear zipper is hard to zip and feels as though it will break,0
my dad liked the shirt its printed nicely and the material is soft the only reason it did not get a fivestar rating was because it arrived smelling strongly of chemicals my dad has a heartlung condition and i was worried the scent would bother him so i had to wash it before it giving it to him,2
a little small they are wearing out a little sooner then expected,1
wore it 1 time and ripped right up the side cheaply made i worried about that when i saw it should have returned it,0
the gold color turns dark very fast,1
love these for such inexpensive sunglasses they are actually great quality and i use them every day,2
its alright i would not buy again kiwi is a better product all it does is clean up shoes and boots a little nothing surprising or amazing i believe overpriced,1
love the stretch watch band looks great with the apple watchbr shipping was fast,2
look just like a heart with green leave,1
i ordered 2 of these for my boys but they will never wear them they are like the puffy shirt from seinfield they pouf out at the bottom in a ridiculous way and are soooo thin you can see underware underneath bummer,1
no what i spect it too short and material ripe after one ise dont spend your money,0
this hat is boxy in the front and does not fit like my other costa hats do,0
both broke in several places within a week,0
i loved them when i first put them on and wore them the first day then i washed them now theyre short and even tight at the bottom what a disappointment,0
hate it i am very petite i can wear a 30 or 32 but based on the reviews of it running small i ordered a 34 ab as you can see by the photos the outside of the package says 34 but the garment itself says 36 its enormous on even on the smallest notches its huge around what a total waste of money,0
i am a 9year breast cancer survivor since having a mastectomy finding a bathing suit that looks cute hides my scars without looking like a potato sack and is actually comfortable has been a nightmare this one is all that and then some its trendy very comfortable and it perfectly hides my scars after reading the reviews i decide to buy a size larger than my normal so i ordered the large instead of a medium im glad i did the suit does run a little small my only other criticism is the padding its too thick and awkward and ill have to cut the fabric to remove them overall this is a great suit i am very happy with it i would purchase again from this seller,2
this line is made for tiny spanish women i am a small usually but both the medium and large are too small for me,0
i really like this blouse but it was way to large,1
terrible quality had to return,0
it should be no show but when i wear toms shoes top of the socks is showing a bit,1
so much so i bought a second pair,2
although cute for the fourth of july the fit of this shirt isnt for women its very boxy and fits more like a mens muscle shirt,1
love this company what you see is what you get they are very pretty will enjoy for years to come,2
so as others have noted its not tough at all the metal bent pretty easy after only one trip on an airline the metal bent so much i cant remove the business card inside to swap out for my wifes see photo below it would of been better to just purchase a flexible tough plastic sleeve that cant be ripped rather then use this thin metal tag disappointed as these are not cheap at all the wire clasp requires you to align just perfect to attach to bag handles so you cant just attach and reattach quickly,0
love this blouse i got the navy and it looks and fits great it is different than most of the plain blouses had trouble getting the wrinkles out though,2
not at all what i expected see through fabric not like picture at all draping is off,0
i was attracted to this brand by the pant length choices my waist would suggest xl but it was far too big and l fits well i like the material and the number of pockets everyone comments on the nice olive green color,2
my hands are around average size im 130 pounds and 54 with a ring size of 7 the gloves are good quality but they are too tight and the fingers are too long for me they would be great for someone with thin hands and long fingernails,1
the multiple zipper pockets will keep all travel documents cell phone wallet and other items right at your fingertips,2
they are soft and i like the length but they ride up so that kind of makes them worthless,1
i am 53 180 lbs i bought a size xl and they fit great i love these jeans so i bought 3 pairs all colors i only wish they had some earth tone colors as wellbr ssrs,2
i had gotten these for a costume and got something completely different i got ones that had a rounded mask attached that barely made it half way up my forehead returned immediately,0
i like the bottoms but the top is way too huge for a small,1
it is thin as paper see thru not worth the money,0
t shirt is a good basic shirt and fits true to size wish it was more olive color like in the picture but otherwise fine,2
well made comfortable shoe,2
mostly comfortable but even after a few months the cuff is incredibly snug leaves indentation on my skin for like an hour after wearing them all day weird,1
dont fit well for petite size but are comfortable and can be altered easily for better fit,1
love this dress,2
updated review i love this sweatshirt still billions is one of my favorite tv shows after my 2nd wash of the hoodie cold water gentle cycle air dry tumble for 30 minutes then pulled out and hang dry it seems to have shrunk to a large i am 6234 245lbs so a relatively large person and it fit perfect after the 1st wash but it somehow shrunk a bunch this time the sleeves are short now to where its uncomfortable to wear the torso is shortened by about 334 as well very disappointed but will wear it around the house when i get up and have coffee i guess its fantastic until you wash itwhich doesnt make it a very reliable purchase unfortunately,1
this hat is super warm and the ponytail hole is great i work as paramedic so i need to wear my head up and out of the way and im outside in the elements this is the best of both worlds,2
great fit exactly what i was looking for,2
seems to be a decent shoe but the sizes are way off i found the shoe to be incredibly narrow,0
i want fond of the material of the shorts quality is very poor and thestyle doesnt reflect the picture overall i had to return because it wasnt worth how much i paid for,1
comfortable but seams are coming apart on the upper already cheaply made,1
nice design leather is a little waxy,1
too big sending back for a smaller size its cute and soft but doesnt seem to offer any support hoping the smaller size will help,1
oh come on this isnt even square garbage goes in the trash,0
i bought these for my wife they are pretty except the coils are different,1
beautiful necklace but cheaper quality wore it once and im too afraid itll break if i wear it again,1
these are good quality however they are in no way 34large34 that is the reason for the two stars these are roughly half the size of a standard paper grocery bag for those who remember paper bags,0
cheap thin fabriccute print,1
i received mine and noticed right away the difference from the product picture they make it look like its an embossed metal coin what i got was a metal circle with a round graphic set in clear plastic huge disappointment not nearly worth what theyve charged and i was giving it as a gift so no time to go out and get a better one never again,0
while i love the weight and the bead colors the bands at the ends of each cord tend to stretch and release the arms of my glasses both readers and sunglasses after a short time now i use them to keep knitting needles together as a set while not being used very disappointing,1
i will say this is a super cute hoodie the top is thinner than the bottom i typically wear a 2x in shirts and 20 in pants its snug only as i pull over my hips but the arms and the top are a good length i dont regret this purchase it is very cute but if you have wider hips it can be snug at the bottom,1
cute dress thin material but comfortable completely see through youll def need something to go under definitely not good quality,1
great value but the wire wants to spin in the hole where it connects to the acrylic,1
the tag inside the garment indicates this sweater is 78 viscose 19 polyester 3 spandex this is different than the online description the fabric is thin lightweight soft the bell sleeves are a nice feature you can dress it up by adding a scarf bling and a vest for extra warmth on cold winter days,1
still trying to set the time,1
fits alil big on top but that can be easily fixedbr br i did expect for the plum lace dress to be a darker purple color rather than a magenta color but for the price i paid im going to keep it reguardless just an all around great dress for many different occasions,1
beautiful hat just didnt fit my head,1
these did not work for me at all i guess my calfs are too big but gave them to a family member who has a foot 3 sizes smaller and smaller calfs and they felt they were tight also,1
ive been wearing this belt for a couple daysbr br some good pointsbr easy to cut down to size just pop it open and use a scissorsbr adjustable in smaller increments than a traditional hole and peg style beltbr attractive nice letter nice black finish on bucklebr makes a gratifying click ratchet sound when being engagedbr br on the down sidebr too easy to lose grip just by bumping the bucklebr takes a little concentration to slide the belt into the proper slotbr br in general i like it ill be cutting it down in size again and handing it off to my 13 year old son who needs a belt,2
love the material and style but it didnt fit my head right too small possibly because of how much hair i have,2
handy and durable we love the texture of the material and the quality the handle is quite strong love the material,2
these are a great casual sandal the price is great great comfort and fit,2
sowed up in an unmarked plastic bag no logo on them like in the picture not sure if they are knockoffs did not feel a difference from crew socks,1
what is good overall nice shoe thin lightweight nice stylebr what is not so good color is not as advertised shoe is purple and spelling errors on package ie mead in china havent seen these kind of errors for a while maybe back in the 70s 80sbr told my friends it was a great laughbr come on team you can do much betterbr i am keeping the shoe it is to much fun not to show off the actual vs advertised color,1
didnt fit so i returned it,0
it looks a little cheap and it stained my bathroom counter which i dont know why ill see how it looks with the ensemble all together,1
it doesnt look like its designed to absorb sweat and im medium size girl 5334 tall but it was very tight,1
sent it to my brother for a xmas present and his son took it from him because he thought it was so cool,2
you get what you pay for,0
product fits as expected but it is difficult to determine sizes without the use of measurements the vest is too smal but the jacket fits well initially ordered an extra large but the jacket was too big the pants fit well but had to return entire unit to get a smaller jacket it would be nice if you could return only the item that needed to be exchanged for a different size overall i am pleased,1
good,2
best pants ever very good material,2
too floppy and edges are rough the strap broke the first time i wore it,1
right size elegant,2
my son loves his hat so much great buy,2
had the watch for 5 months and the back crystal broke rendering the watch useless battery needs to be charger every night features are lacking dont do anything a fitbit cant waist of money no warranty on damage they wanted 70 to replace,0
bought two fit true to size for one kid price was good stretch was okay except its a little tight for husky children needed it for a wedding and they were fine in pictures,1
the dress is really pretty and nicely made but the rest of the items are meh my main issue is that the dress is still too small even after ordering a size up the chest area is too tight but the rest of it is fine for the other little items i dont have many complainants since anything i had an issue with i could easily fix on my own overall 3 outta 5 since i ended up only really using the dress and headband,1
got this for my 9 year old daughter for part of a costume it was perfect easy to get on and the color was just like it looked online,2
it first perfectly and was of good quality,2
the plastic is slick so these tend to back out you have to hold in place but they do work and are cheap worth messing with a bitbr i think ill take some 60grit sandpaper and rough it up a bit to stay in place,2
i purchased these for my son and he like them very much,2
ive purchased a lot of skechers and was surprised when the rubber sole started to separated from the leather upper with this sneaker i barely got them broken in and this started to happen i tried to save the sneaker with bonding glues but the leather kept on ripping surprised and i will be staying away from this style,1
the trouser belt loop metal spring loaded connectors will damage any fabric they come into contact with the picture above depicts the damage to my drivers side seat after a one day usage the seat was in a like new condition before this happened the damage is difficult to assess at this time most likely i will have to remove the seat and replace it with one purchased at a salvage yard the labor and cost of the seat will be likely more than 300,0
weird cut passed on to someone else because the waste is huge,0
hello to anyone interested in buying this awesome leather jacket dont doubt my feedbacki was so happy to receive my jacket 4 days ahead of schedule blingsoul is a vender you will love dealing with fast reply to emails and a great customer service dept the leather smells and feels soft and only has a very minor smell of leather the size i purchased was xl for im 5 ft 11 inchs and weigh 205 lbs i can buy clothing off the rack and it fits 90 of the time with no problem the shearling lining is plush and warm i only wish there were two pockets more to the front of the jacket the over all design and coloring as well as comfort gets a 10 from me thanks for all the great feedback people before me posted it helped me make a decision to buy the merchant blingsoul is a notch above other merchants ive delt with onlinebr i hope this helped in your decision to buybr br herbr e,2
very cute little ring just wish it fit when i got it had to return it bc it was too small order a size up,2
the swimsuit was used and dirty i can see the sands inside and also the white sweat,0
watch is brown and not black i needed black,0
despite other reviews i found not liking this product much bc they didnt stay long enough,0
good for light shopping,2
two years ago i purchased my first pair of patrizia candice platform sandals in tan i have worn them everywhere work all day in them have worn them all day in disneyland and they have been so comfortable and stylish that i just love them so much so that last year i purchased a second backup pair for some day when i can no longer find them as well as a pair in navy im still wearing and loving my first pair and they have held up fabulously however the navy pair has problems that pair ive had a year less and have worn them far less than the first tan pair a couple of months ago i noticed the white stitching at the toe is coming unstitched this morning i put them on and noticed that the upper is ripping between the perforated holes so there is now about a 34 hole in my shoe im so disappointed my patrizia candice shoes are my favorite shoes to wear and i get compliments on them nearly every time i wear them and someone new sees them,1
exactly what i was looking for,2
i really liked the fabric and fit initially but the elastic waist gave out too quickly to be useful youve got to baby these with hand washing and i think the elastic died when they made it into the washer,1
i got a 29 and it is longer than my other pants may have to hem them,1
these are supposed to be over the knee socks but barely come to the knee disappointed with the height but they are cute for knee socks i would have given it 5 stars if it wasnt misrepresented by the photo,1
i find adidas shirts are one or two sizes smaller than other comparable brands what a shame,0
got for my mom she said its comfortable,2
i dropped it down a flight of stairs after just my first day i was thoroughly impressed when it bounced 3 times and hit the floor without it breaking opening and it only has two tiny scuff marks it felt flimsy when i took it out of its box but it completely proved me wrong fit my big lens sunglasses no problem and its really pretty a bit bulky but its worth it for the protection it evidently provides,2
this would of been perfect to hold my mask throughout the day i have to constantly take it off and put it on sometimes i put in on the floor and that doesnt help i bought this to make things easier on me howver the material are low quality the straps feel like they will break and it doesnt stay on the position i left it,0
love everything about these,2
i like the sunglasses but it is a bit small than expected it is affordable good quality,1
this does not hold a lot can not have checkbook and money in it at same time or clasp doesnt work,1
i keep tripping with this shoe,1
there is seriously something wrong with the american apparel sizes this is a mans large and my husband and i both laughed as soon as we held it up hes not a fat man and a large shirt should fit him fine with a bit of room to move he looked like he was squeezed into a tube in thisbr br i can wear it and it fits me fine its actually the same physical size as a womens medium in the same style the material is soft and its a comfortable shirt it just is not a mans large shirt,0
fit sort of funny,1
zipper broke on first use while on vacation definitely wouldnt recommend,0
i felt it was too tight around the leg part of the sock i had to take it off after a few hours didnt find that it helped much,1
need to know if background material is supposed to be white mine is light pink asked question but still waiting for answer,0
great product,2
varicose veins,2
these are amazing yoga socks i finally can enjoy my mat with no yoga towel or anything they stay on well have great grip and fit perfectly i wear a size 7 for reference the strap across the top of your arch is thick and well made but i like the hole to give the feet some air they also wash without any issue i prefer to put them in a mesh laundry bag to be safe and i cant remember if i dry them but because the grippy part might melt i would either do them on low or just air dry theyre greatbr br if you found this review helpful please consider clicking the helpful button below,2
these are way too long to wear with just regular shoes when they say boot cut they mean it has to be boots,1
zipper broke going back,0
beautiful scarf happy with this purchase,2
skimp skamps fit just as well as they always do i needed some new underwear and the stores were too crazy with holiday shoppers so i am glad i could find these online edit every single one of my reviews of the items intended to cover 34the two things on my chest34 is being knocked out by amazons 34sensitivity filter34 and i have no clue why wow now theyre knocking out my reviews of clothing items intended to wear under pantsskirts i guess i cant even use the word 34under wear34,2
the hat wasnt what i thought it was or what i needed i was expecting a upf 50 or above i didnt read the description appropriately and the hat i received was more of a dress up hat not a sunpool hat my error,0
these suits are great and well made the sizing is an issue i have had to order there suits three different times because the sizing is not correct something the listed size is uk and not us conversion,1
my wife loves it its soft and comfortable great buy,2
returned these the design of how you clasp the two ends together to close them around your ear is not good i couldnt close them at all plus note the diameter in the writeupthese are too small for the average adult woman they arent big enough to drop from your earwhen inserted they look more like little wiresbr e two ends clasptogether are designed they are very difficult to close too difficult and please note the diameter of these as they are absurdly tiny for an adult female,0
i only gave these 3 stars because there were flaws in the knitting they serve the purpose for which i bought themto keep my lower legs warm,1
the cheapest brittle frames i have ever encountered in a so called sport sunglass product the right temple arm broke during normal use,0
my girlfriend needed tops with long sleeves for work we wanted to find some that fit well and look good while being pretty inexpensive since her job tends to be rough on clothingbr this top fits those requirements the price is good it fits her she likes the feel of the fabric and we both like the way it looks on her it has a sexy look when she leaves some of the buttons undone,2
the seam on the sleeve ends start to unravel quickly and makes it looks you have worn the jacket for years even though it started on the second use,1
the bar must be stainless steel because it doesnt cause me any irritation the cuff on the other hand is complete trash it tarnished the first week of wear its soo cute but disappointing,0
these pants are so comfortable they are a little snug on me but they have a stretch to them so its okay the material is extremely soft and comfortable i also love the cut,2
need size m,2
not very good quality but adequate for the cost,1
beautiful print made good just a tad small all his shirts are large so anyways if i buy from you again ill do an xlarge,2
all three of my shirts the left top seam on top of the shoulder doesnt match up there is a quarter or an eighth of an inch where it doesnt match up quite right makes me feel like a low quality product,0
this is such a great idea my husband is constantly making fun of me for making a mess when we eat out i like the designs of these so it is not as embarrassing to pull out if you are out to eat this is super long and i would prefer it to be a little shorter but that is ok it is also a little tight around my neck but works,2
my daughter likes the top but not the bottom its style,1
great product for children,2
purchased this based on descriptions but way too large and mediocre so im returning this but it costs too much to return so ill donate it but i warn others not to purchase this,0
warm comfortable and classy however the zipper is very large and heavy,2
comfortable but it is very light and seethrough,1
its a beautiful necklace however the blue resinstone was badly scratchet and very noticeable i would like to return this and receive a necklace without the damage,0
buyer bewereitem is described as copa mundial they will ship you the the lesser quality shoe the káiser 5 tried to return them through ups but shipping cost is 220 to send them back to gb 3x the cost of the shoe do not buy unless you want káiser 5 cleats,0
was really excited about this dress when it came but when i opened it it looked like dyes made discolored lines on the print part of the dress i ordered a medium but the material seemed like it may shrink after washing,1
nice,2
i took a chance on this bc of the pretty pattern but honestly i would not purchase it againbr br prosbr it fits as expected yay and covers the area under your armpits the length is great for a plus sized woman who likes to fully cover the belly and backside areabr br consbr the fabric has a weighted feel which sucks in the summer heat it is heavy and thick not cool and lightweight the bottom of the top is not hemmed so it looks unfinished and cheap the straps are not adjustable this wasnt much of an issue due to the appropriate fit but it may bother someone who needs to adjust the strapsbr br if you want a thicker tank with an unhemmed finish this is the shirt for you if you want a lightweight summer top with soft fabric keep looking,0
cheaply m hand made ugly nothing like pictured i sent it back to sender,0
cheap compared to older tops i had one like it but 15 years old it is the same except the older one looks and feels like 1000 and the other looks and feels like 1,0
sizes run large and both pairs were returned after a few weeks do to obnoxious squeaking cliff clavin,0
wonderful dress receive so many compliments on it will likely order another in a different color fit is just perfect,2
they had to be returned they came with several scratches on them and i was unable to see through the scratches,0
regardsbr i just received my order which came this product without its lid and i do not think i can use it that way in the same way i got the tshirt of a very large size and chose the size l and came very large size xlbr br what can we do about it,0
con runs smallbr pro nice image,2
i followed instructions and applied 2 coats to a couple pairs of sneakers i was excited to test it by sprinkling a few drops of water right on them but it did barely nothing about half the water just soaked right in,0
delivery on time good quality fits just right would buy anorher,2
i looked like i had a sack on,0
for around 20 youre getting a premium deck w a graphic as well as some nice wheels that have some solid bearings and the trucks slide great,2
videoid632feda17749388965f85bccd6dd557e im heartbroken i opened the package about a week and a half ago and immediately fell in love with the dress as i now pack for vacation i noticed it has 2 small holes on one of the sleeves as i inspect the dress more carefully it looks like someone else had used it before the dress is beautiful and light material perfect for my vacation in mexico except its used and ripped otherwise this purchase would have been a 5 star,1
nice tanks but i ordered a 2xl and these fit a larger small size person or a smaller medium size personbr br they are nowhere in the neighborhood of a large much less a 2xl muscular person,0
doesnt fit right,0
fits well comfortable,2
works on your tummy area more that the shoulder area i was interested in,1
these rings are exactly what i was looking for feel well made and durable and are a fraction of the cost of name brand competitors very happy with purchase plan on buying more when needed highly recommended,2
great glasses,2
the color isnt really a millennium pink its more of a dusty salmon pinkorange but the quality of the fur and cut is pretty good its difficult to get a refund from the company theyll try to offer you 30 to not ship it back to the country of origin,1
fit well and the little person who received them loved them,2
this is not a nice fabric tshirt like it looks in the photo its cheap synthetic material that is printed on colors are different than pictures also will return,0
as noted by some other customers the calves on these boots are tight i have had them 34stretching34 since i tried them on i think i may only be able to wear with tights i have normal sized calves never needed a wide its a shame the style is great i dont think they are real leather either i am keeping them fingers crossed,2
xl will fit a 34dd bust not like the picture top is seethrough you will need to wear a vest underneath,1
the lenses did not fit my glasses i have a pair of costa fantails and will be returning the lenses not sure if its my glasses or the lenses but the lenses were just slightly to big the lenses and cleaning solutions are a nice touch though,1
top is cute but sizing is not clear in description,0
i really like the material of the shirts but the big difference is the way they look on the add and to what they really look in person what really bothered me is how wide the neck is i doubt medium would have a closer neck fitting than the large which is the size i got,1
very nice small wallet i love crossbody purses this wallet fits in small crossbody bags i love it i have not had any problems with it,2
the dial doesnt light up its not water resistant at allbr the hands glow for about an hour after darkbr pure trashbr i tried to give it away but nobody wants it,0
this necklace is way too small for the price i love the look and how dainty it is but the price ridiculous,0
the elastic band started to get soft less than a year after bying it very disapointed would not recommend though the color is acurrate,1
i used magnifier to check the top material its not leather i am very sure its not leather topbr the label discloses its all man made materials so i gave up and returned it,1
very disappointed in this item after only wearing for 4 months the material turned a pinkish color that would not come off i was told by my supervisors that i couldnt wear them anymore as they are very strict on our appearance,0
the bracket appears to be well made its a good size and seems durable the problem is i cannot open it i read the instructions before ordering and it seemed simple enough but my hands are not strong enough apparently to pull and push it open maybe they should add a video so that others can watch and determine if its a good purchase decision,0
our son needed a new set of swim trunks and we discovered kanu and now we will always buy kanu for our son the print is gorgeous in person and the fit is perfect the fabric is soft and supple making high activity easy when wet the cut on the legs looks better than other brands weve purchased and fits more like an adult with slightly longer legs which we wanted,2
purse will not hold up well looks nice but you can tell its cheaply made you get what you pay for though,0
they fit really weird in the waist and crotch area but whatever they are sleep shorts so who really cares what they look like they are good enough for sleeping lounging and going on walks in my neighborhood,1
dont buy these shoes unless you like walking on gravel barefoot,0
the large fits like a small it ripped behind the arm the second time i wore it br im 58 athletic lady the arms are too short and its way too tight across the back when im driving or skiing its too baggy around the waist and is not as long as shown want to return it disappointed with this purchase,0
they smelled like terrible fake plastic when i received them in i loved the way they looked i just could not get over the manufacturing smell,1
these look cute and seem like they should be comfortable i have to wear socks though so they wont rub blisters by my toes,1
