no it what i expected it to be,1
fell apart the second day i had it,0
cannot adjust the nose bridge probably missing partsbr will return to amazon,0
this is my third set of spencos i am female with wide feet and some foot pain these shoes are great,2
its ok,1
style not flattering to me at all but very cute on my friend i gave it to made me look dumpy i think the size i ordered may have been too large however i tend to think the style was just not meant for me my friend tried it on and it suited her perfectly,1
nice quality shirt the fit is wrong,1
its made cheap not worth the money,0
the goodbr nice appearancebr long battery lifebr configurable notificationsbr variety of watch faces and appsbr easy setupbr br the badbr costbr br overall the pebble steel is a bit of a luxury item but it performs well and looks nicebr br setup the pebble steel comes with the watch and charging cord however it is up to the user to supply the charger that accepts a usb connection if you are like me you have plenty of these from other devices however if you do not just know that you will need an additional accessory just to get up and running the watch charged in a couple of hours and then it was on to the pairing process i installed the pebble app on my samsung galaxy s5 and it was easy to get connected android is all about notifications and the pebble app lets you control which ones go to the watch on a per app basisbr br watch faces the android pebble app is where you go to get watch faces and apps for the pebble i wanted my pebble to look like a normal watch and i went with the analog watch face that comes from the factory while that may seem boring pebble has a wealth of others to choose from including various bands and tv shows you can choose as subtle or outlandish as you desire and the bottom line is that you have choices there are also composite watch faces that include weather notification counts and other items too however be advised that everything that updates the display has a cost in battery lifebr br apps the pebble store has a number of apps to choose from too while there are many for weather sports email and text responders i chose to keep things simple i have dashboard controls phone toggles here to there gives estimated travel time to saved destinations and trello list management such as shopping lists there are also apps for evernote and wunderlist but i found the trello watch app worked best for shopping listsbr br usage i bought my pebble for a pretty specific purpose i keep my phone on vibrate during working hours at a minimum and i often missed calls or text messages with the pebble i am able to see when i get a call or a text and the information display provides useful information to me on the spot i can see who contacted me along with the contents of text messages i also like that i can dismissignore phone calls from the watch the other notification that i have sent to my pebble is calendar reminders it is handy to see where my next meeting is without having to pull my phone out finally i find it much easier to manage the shopping list without having to constantly unlock my phone as you may have gathered the pebble steel is a pure convenience for me albeit one that does what i want it to quite wellbr br battery life battery life is heavily dependent on usage,2
too loose and the key goes in too deep so you cant put the key all the way in to the door,0
keeps coming unlatched from my watch three times now it has come off each time after several days of wear and im double checking it when i clasp it on initially,0
i had this suit in my amazon cart and actually found it in a local chain sporting goods store i was able to try in on in sizes 3812 and 4014 i am 5334 165 4034 full bust not band 35534 waist 43534 hips and 63534 torso shoulder through crotch and back to shoulder point so im a difficult fit and tyrs online sizing chart had me in a 34 38 and 40 off the charti wear a 1012 in regular clothing top and bottom and a 36b brabr br anyway personal humiliation and selfloathing aside i could not perceive much of a difference in the two sizes i found both to be tight but not too small with good compression and coverage however i found both to feel short in the torso with a pull at the crotchthe dreaded toe they also felt narrow in the crotch on a thinner person this may not be an issue the cutout in the back is high and will provide plenty of backside coverage up and down side to side is another story the higher cut on the leg coupled with the shorter torso makes wedgies a likelihood for a larger backside the top provided plenty of coverage for me bcup and will cover a larger chest the wider straps may provide more support of a larger chest however this is a swimming suit not a bathing suit you will not have padding cups shelf bra or spot control of tummy butt or back fatbr br i didnt find the fit of this suit comfortable in the length had it fit properly the pattern was not as flattering as the on on the suit i ended up buying httpwwwamazoncomspeedowomensrelaunchflybackswimsuitdpb00obwk5sarefsr_1_37ssportsandfitnessieutf8qid1442942179sr137keywordsspeedoswimsuitwomen size 4014br br seems that ordering a size up if you have a long torso or any curves at all is a good idea for swimming not bathing suits in general if you are looking for a very casual fit for just hanging out at the pool youll likely order up a couple of sizes ultimately you should do the leg work to try on clothing of any sort before ordering online beware that many times clothing sold online is 34irregular34 or mistagged,1
made well heavy weight fabric i love it,2
videoidfc15573f83b71a13f464375f4f480255 wow i love the shape and feel of this 7 inch bracelet i am a big fan of sterling silver and this silver is polished and it shines the diamonds look so huge their clarity matches the silver so well the tennis links feel comfortable to wear and has a very unique look i found the bracelet easy to put on by myself and it has a secure and easy locking mechanism on the side impressivebr br trust you found this review honest and helpful,2
after reading all the reviews i thought these would be a winner not so the size i almost always wear pinched my toes i also found the sole to be hard and there wasnt enough arch support for me,0
way to small,0
love the dots mine does not appear to be cut higher on side hem even all the way around falls just below the knee fits well,2
son hermosas buen precio y el tamaño es exacto,2
fits perfect,2
really cute fit my daughter perfect however not even 5 minutes into wearing them the plastic strap was cutting into her and the shows would come off every 5 min she had friction cuts on where the front strap is and she couldnt have worn them for more than 15 minutes cant say how good they may be since we didnt get but one wear out of them before we had to chuck them,1
although this is cute when the wings are extended there is no way to keep the wings extended you have to hold the wings up otherwise they just hang there like a blanket the mask is rather cheap and the eye holes way too small,0
it fit ok at first but after it was washed it shrank,0
no as good quality as i expected but will work,1
smaller than what on the picture and its not multicolor just an ivy color im wondering if this is real natural opal or labcreated bc it states natural opal but it doesnt look like it,0
great product,2
very nice boot quality is good i take a 75 and ordered a 75 but they were very snug i would size up unfortunately had to return them as the grey is more of a taupe color than a grey i even got a few opinions and all i asked said they were taupe,1
i was really looking forward to these shoes and thought that they looked really cool but once i put them on i knew immediately that they werent going to workbr br upon putting them on i could tell immediately that they were way too slender they hug the inside of my foot like they are hanging onto dear life in us sizing my feet fit perfectly in various styles of shoes and i do not require a wide setting but these shoes would suggest otherwise as they are so tight that they are terribly uncomfortable i was able to walk around them for about an hour to get a feel for them until i just couldnt take the restriction any longer the cushion in them is great and they are really cool looking its just such a shame that they are designed with such a painfully slender foot in mindbr br overall i wouldnt recommend unless youre foot is extremely slim in relation to us everyday footwear,1
ordered up two sizes like it it said to on the reviews and it is still very small,0
the material is nice however this is far too small i ordered the xl in the ivory which i didnt have too high hopes for when i opened the package i was delightfully surprised to find the construction of the dress to be good the stitching seamed strong and the material was soft and silkybr br i wish this dress fit because it just looked and felt so beautiful here are my measurements b4634 w3834 h4834 and again i ordered the xl it was tight across the chest there are certain things that i can try on and say 34yeah if i lost some weight this would fit34 but sadly this is not one of those things i am trying to lose weight but even at a more healthy size i dont get a sense that this will fitbr br finally even if it fit on the chest this dress was really short im 6034 and this hit just below my buttocks id need to wear bloomers with this to not be insulting tall people bewarebr br if only i could get the pattern for this dress then i could sew one that would fit oh wellbr br overall i would recommend this dress for shorter folks who are small in the breast theyll look gorgeous and i think this dress will last in a brief glance the material and construction looked solid,1
big toe went through sock after only a couple of wears,0
it tells time just fine a cheap basic watch the light for it is garbage though can hardly read the minute digits at night with it,1
i am 54 wear a size 6 and have hips and a chest and this fits perfectly its a really wellmade costume with lots of pieces to make a complete look the arm things dont look quite like the picture but theyre still cute i cant wait to wear this for halloween very cute,2
got these shoes 2 days ago very cute but the right shoe lights already ran out i dont see nor were there directions on any way to recharge or change the batteries also the right shoes bow has completely come unravelled causing me to have to remove them i would not purchase these again,0
love the look of these laces my only complaint is the outer layer bunches up when try to remove to clean my boots if you never remove the laces they will be great i probably wont buy again,1
the case is 68 in long not the claimed 72 in glasses wont fit,0
good quality and nice dress this dress is very short i dont mind because its the look i was going for i am 59 i am returning because i found the same dress same size with more stretch from another seller otherwise i would have made it work,2
i didnt read the title clearly so thats my fault i didnt know it was clear other than that its a good bag pretty small but some people like that from far away it looks like prada because of the triangle i give it a 610,1
the product seems durable and comfortable but it fits smaller than desired,2
beautiful pattern but fits much smaller and tighter then expected,1
i love this little thing but the quality leave a little something to be desired fabric came apart at the seam would give 5 stars but it wears quickly with wear,1
uncomfortable on ankles for lack of support and makes my feet sweat too much,1
beautiful looking and love the color returned because the zipper opening was so small that you could barely put your hand inside the purse,1
i bought this to replace one that i thought was just like it this one is just okthe front pockets on my old baggalini bag were deep enough to comfortably hold my water bottlethe pockets in this one are not quite deep enough and the bottle easily falls out in the car etc also in my old bag the middle pocket in the front had a little 34sleeve pocket34 that was perfect for carrying business card this bag doesnt have that lastly the big pocket in the back is great but my old bag was made with to zippers so that i could slip it over the handle of my luggage when i travel there are fewer interior pockets as well i kept it i love how durable baggalini bags are and they are generally pretty smart looking,1
definitely love my socks,2
nice bag only thing i do not like is it is on the heavy side also the piping on strap started falling off,1
nothing exceptional,1
the costume was very good and held up well however im glad that i ordered a larger one than my normal size or it might not have fit i wear a 12 or 14 and this 1624 fit me comfortably a larger person would have looked bad in it,1
excellent price and seems to be of good quality the tie closure is a little short but it works,2
way too small,0
this dress certainly has that 100 polyester feel i have a size 12 and it measures 375 from the top of the shoulder to the bottom there is a 23 zipper in the back the dress is lined in the front top crossover section only the size 12 is almost straight down there is not much tapering in the waist if the waist is too large then a belt could be used such as a long scarf the top fits more for a fullfigured lady this dress is made in china so at sixtynine bucks for polyester its kind of pricey,1
no flexibilitybr these socks have no give they are the right size but they dont stretch well the elastic fibers break if you stretch them i know they are compression but compression socks still stretch also i dont have giant calves i have average or small calves socks being so tight they break has never been an issue bottom line not great quality,0
daughter enjoyed her nice warm socks for christmas,2
love these shoes great fit very stylist,2
nice vest but color was not as shown cor description says orange however in actuality it was more like brown orange i returned it,1
perfect size,2
terrible fitting the top rolls down,0
i really wanted to like this bohemian inspired dress but it was way too tight across the chest i wear a 40dd i even ordered up to make sure that it would fit unfortunately it didnt however if you can get the right size it is pretty cute the fabric is black cream with orange designs there are buttons down the upper portion of the front which were pulling open on me and it stops midcalf super cute concept but super tight on me i will be returning this,0
the bras are a bit small but it was my on faultbr i thought i was ready a smaller size,2
the straps keep ripping i purchased 3 of these and each time the straps rip off,0
to small,1
theyre very colorful thin and will not aid in keeping you safehealthy when i had it on i was able to blow out a match so if youre ordering for corvid 9 prevention this will not work,0
nice for my nose piercing but when i say small im not joking dont let the 2m fool you its tiny more metal than stone,1
excellent,2
love the idea but my crossfit thighs are too big would love for them to make a larger version,1
i read all the reviews and ordered a size up they fit perfect too cute the only problem is they do something funky just below the ankle ordered them for our co trip walking in snow up to the ankles and my feet stayed warm and didnt get wet they were just perfect,1
too tight material does not stretch itchy because the sequence im giving it away,0
the toe box 1 too wide 2 too high it hurts my toes for past 10 years ive only worn merrell all have been siren sport ii 2 these new shoes are siren sport iii 3 let me know when manufacturer makes either the ss ii again or makes a different ss perhaps a iv 4,1
my back and legs fell so much betterno more back pan,2
these earrings are a great size and well made however the bonded gold finish looks fake i dont feel comfortable wearing them and should have returned them,0
muy grande,1
i did aqll the measurementsstill way too smallmy son liked them however so i gave them to him,1
absolutely love these,2
i like the material and the quality but the dye bleeds onto lighter colors,0
other than my sons wide feet that require a little extra room these are great shoes he said they felt a little narrow around front end of his foot these had a really nice finish on them great quality for a great price,2
i didnt return this but gave it to a friend it fit way to tight im a medium size and that is usually what i order i loved the color,0
lens popped out before my friend even had a chance to put them on we were able to snap it back in place but i wouldnt buy these again,0
i ordered the army green in a small and medium for size comparison i received 2 totally different dresses this is the 2nd time this has happened on amazon last time customer support said a different vendor will be used for a different size well im not ordering from a different vendor im sending both dresses back the size small is army green but the material is awful it states 95 polyester but if feels like stiff cotton the size medium is a gross brown color but the material is great it feels soft and silky good luck with whatever dress you ladies get so disappointed,1
too big,1
love these socks a little pricey otherwise no problem,2
very comfortable shoe i love clarks quality,2
the fit was close but not made all that well i sent them back,2
these look a lot more faded than i expected so thats fine if thats what youre going for they are very well made,1
im a 32bc and the top doesnt fit as hoped doubt ill wear it at all but if i do ill have to wear a sports bra underneath,1
card album is the size of a card holds about two packs of cards the album cover is pretty thin out of my two packs i did get an alternative art card so that was cool one pack was a total dud,1
these are really great shoes top quality materials and workmanship great looking the silver bling is awesome and they are super comfortable the stocking is snug but not tightgreat arch support love these shoes,2
it does not look like the picture material cheap,0
the sides of the shoes come up way too far they dug into the bones on the sides of my ankles so it was impossible to wear these shoes,0
it is soo cheap you can feel it way too light looks are mediocre but not terrible,0
too narrownot very comfortable,0
too small pockets,1
fit well but the quality wasnt there very cheap feeling material,0
worst doesnt function so sliperry doesnt stick well waste of money do not buy this,0
knock around use,2
not what i expected but ok,1
i brought these earings for my 17 year old son thinking they were the size as advertised lol but they are soooo little they have to be for a infant so i gave them to my niece,0
bought the blue camo pants on november 24 2020br br theyve been washed once stupidly the cord wasnt knotted so one end disappeared got a safety pin and began threading it through the tube that is when i noticed how cray the fabric isbr br i didnt expect a lot for this price but really i think i could have gotten better quality at wallymart there were bald spots and actual small holes not near seems but just here and therebr br i would have bought a half a dozen more of these for the family if they had been at all nice but the quality is seriously lacking they are comfy by the way but if they wont last a year thats not a good or fail deal,0
absolutely worth it been wearing them for awhile now and i change them whenever i please to match an outfit no irritation stays nice and snug perfect size very good quality worth it,2
so darn cute this costume was a big hit,2
parece de baby doll la tela y corre pequeño,0
the package arrived damaged and when i took the glasses out the nose pieces are missingi cant even wear them,2
fit a little small which i expected from other reviews order a half size up like i did and theyll fit decent quality for the price you definitely need to wear them a bit to break them in,2
super girly and flirty dress runs a bit small recommend to go up a size,1
poorly made super thin the seems were torn in multiple places upon arrival super cute print on the pants but super poor quality,0
was disapointed that the material was polyester but at least it will not wrinkle,2
beautiful,2
they fit true to size and look great with shorts skinny jeans and casual skirtsskorts highly recommend the wedge is subtle and makes legs look longer good quality and comfortable,2
description is 100 wrong it does not come with box i even emailed them they are aware it says with box but all they said was sorry but box is not included,0
this was a birthday gift for the son of a good friend he loves it br nice starter watch for an 13 year old boy,2
love the fit,2
i loved it my order came on time ordered from husbands account and packaged well great fit i am 55 and about 155lbs and still had a little room very comfortable and was a hit loved this purchase great stretchy material,2
love the style,2
nothing worse than baggy leg holes theres not neqrly enough elastic also not as soft as i expect with cotton love the colors,1
these ran a little smaller than other items i ordered of the same size they fit great through the thighs and hips but it feels like they are really lowcut in the back and i feel like my crack hangs out they are very warm as a base layer and although they look a bit seethrough i have successfully worn them as leggings with a shirt long enough to cover my crack just in case,1
the material is very thin and as stated very skinny arm cut its also a little shorter than expected the material has some stretch and i can make it work for what i need i bought it as a costume piece and had intended to be able to wear it for casual every day after however that is unlikely i guess for the price you get what you pay for with this jacket,1
my husband lives in this boxers,2
they are a good deal thin but no holes coming through yet recommend these,2
i returned it the pendant fell off the chain and i had a hard time getting it back on very cheap quality chain the pendant itself was nice,0
the item is huge at bottom and small at top fits like its defective i have just been stuck with it never have been worn before,0
this is more polyester looking and therefore i was disappointed i thought it would be more of a cotton look or flowy but nopelooked like my mom would wear itkinda like a chicos knockoff i got the animal print and returned ittried two sizes and both looked bad,1
these are adorable i love the little foot shaped gripper on the bottom makes it easy for my toddler to put them on the right foot we use these for her classroom slippers they are perfect,2
fit my 56 year olds feet well but they already seem like my kid will wear them out before he outgrows them used to buying name brand products ie nike or adidas and was hoping for a cheaper alternative the name brands for whatever reason seem to last longer with running out rock climbing than these shoes they are fine for an extra pair of shoes but may not hold up very well if used as a primary pair for an active kid,1
nice enough but had to return as mine did not come with the sash as pictured,1
the top was a little small and the pants were much smaller than other xxl scrubs i have worn,1
smaller than the picture makes it look,0
im a size 9 and these fit true to size but the top part of the boot just isnt cut wide enough to warrant keeping them i do not have large legs by any means but these squeezed my calves and the buckle on the side is purely cosmetic so it wasnt any helpbr br side note the pink color is gorgeous in person very bright and exactly what i hoped for,0
too small,0
these shorts were a great buy im absolutely obsessed they are so soft and so comfortable,2
see thru super short too tight,0
lateral way too thin will be returning,0
when i perchesed the watch i had no idea it was gunna be a toy i didnt want a toy i wanted the real die cast replecia i saw on thinkgeekcom i got this one off amazon because it had a better price and it looked like the one on thinkgeekcom if i knew it was gunna be a toy i would have spent the extra 20 on the real thing looking at it from the front it looks good but its too bulky and childish in my opinion the chain is the only good part of the watch the sound effects are too annoying i had to take one of the batteries out i will defiantly be buying the replecia off thinkgeekcom and throwing this one in my closet i was happy with the sonic screwdriver i got but this was just a waste of money its sad too because david tennant is one of my favorite doctors next to matt smith,0
tight and uncomfortable really cute though,0
a swimsuit top will hold your breast better than this this piece is made from a not so stretchy elastic band and lace thats it the product seems poorly constructed but you get what you pay for i am only giving it to stars because it looks cute around the house,0
these were disappointing the product details claim they are for boots however they are too small width for my cowboy boots mens size 11 flimsy material i will use them to keep the dust off in the closet but i certainly wouldnt use them for travel,1
bought as a gift for my sister and she loved it said she gets lots of compliments from her tennis friends,2
the fabric is thinlightweight its summer so i am fine with that the dress patterndesign is pretty but it runs small in order for the dress to have fit me i would have needed to order a size larger,1
mask was new with tag still on but it was packaged in a box too small the packaging caused mask to bend and would not go back into shape we did not return the mask was unwearable so we used it for a halloween prop,1
weird material and weird pattern on material very unflattering,0
the womens large was a child size glove,1
this shirt is very thin and the length was way to shortnot at all like other polo t shirts i have so i returned it,0
love these socksalmost too warm i wear a size 7 shoe and these were snug before washinghope they dont shrink ad says up to size 9 but i cant imagine even getting a true size 8 in them other than size these are toasty warm well made soft and exactly as expected,2
meh theyre alright gave most of them away thought it would be fun to try,1
these are so cute and awesome my grandson works for cabinet maker will be perfect for work,2
i liked this purse but it wasnt as cute in person basically looked like black jeans turned into a purse that being said it is still a cute casual bag just didnt work for me because there was no good spot for my phone,1
this entire line of cufflinks are classy elegant and wellmade,2
these are perfect in the size s56 for my 3534 32 lb 20 month old they shrank a bit when i washed and dried them the first time anything below a 4t is tight on her waist but of course the legs are always too long and have to be cuffed so i thought 34capris would be perfect34 and they are i have two in each color black and grey nice thick soft stretchy cotton they have the same issue all little girl leggings have though a cut that doesnt take diapers into account which is fine if the pants youre buying are intended for bigger pottytrained girls but we all know that the leggings sold in infant sizes are exactly the same low inseam which means unless your kid is in a onesie which she wont be because they dont really sell onesies above size 2t youll always see the top of her diaper poking out whenever her shirt rides up and as soon as she pees in her diaper once or twice youll be able to plainly see a bulky bulge going down one pant leg especially if shes been sitting in the car seat or stroller maybe i should seek out some 34harem34 pants for her or just put her in dresses more often lord knows she has enough of them but im always worried about her getting them dirty anyway great pants,2
i fell in love with mission gear mid last year or so ive bought a lot of different types of gear shirts shorts pants spandex etc i found the capris and for the most part have found them to be just meh they are a bit loose fitting compared to what i was expecting and thats probably part of the problem ive run in them and done workouts at the house and feel like they just arent tight enough in my normal size to go all out i feel like i pull them up all the time and pull at the legs to make them fit i keep wearing them to see if it gets better but so far ive avoided long runs or outside the house workouts where i cant change if need be,1
great for every day the little liner part is sewn in on the front and back so i know they will last great product and price to replace some old undies,2
broke the second day,0
i expected this to be a lightweight dress it is not the same dress as the picture its very heavy and nasty material nothing like i expected,0
bought for my mom for her birthday and the clasp was broken,0
make sure you by at least one band size and one cup size larger than you normally take these bras run extremely small,0
see thru so disappointing do not buy,0
poor quality thin fabric bad stitching third day of use and the seams are completely broken,0
so i have a hard time finding bras in general because most stores dont carry a 32b rather frustrating so when i ordered this i was a little nervous about how it would fit i love it it fits very well and when i exercise its very supportive i have been using it for about 6 months so it has been tested it has held up well going through the washer i dont put it in the dryer but it has been accidentally put in by my family a few times and it hasnt shown any signs of coming apart i would definitely recommend this to everyone and i have i dont write reviews that often but this deserve one,2
the hat came in neatly folded the hat itself is very flexible and can be adjusted the material on the inside is breathable which is suitable for warm weather the material on the outside is sturdy and solid it seem easy to wash in a washing machinebr its light weigh and easy to storebr br the ribbon is very cute which is suppose to face the back the hat fits securely and will not fall off from a gust of windbr wears great with dress and swimsuitbr br received a free sample to review i hope this helps,2
im so disappointed in this dress ive been wanting one of these and was so excited to get it but its tiny and extremely thin and see through im not sure what i thought i was going to get it fits my arms but thats it not for curvier women i ordered an xl to be safe and was still small,0
i love the dress however the dress sold to me was clearly worn and returned it had really really bad bo given the date of the occasion i needed this dress and wasnt able to send back and reorder to get a new one on time i took a gamble and washed the dress as far as the fit i normally wear size m but def needed a large for a medium like fit order up ladies 3 stars for stinky dress 5 starts for the style and fit,1
definitely was not emerald,0
i used to love ray bans then they got expensive and cheap this pair is such an example the frame quality feels light and flimsy and the glass lenses have no substance to them honestly could not tell if they were glass or plastic but just had to take the manufacturers word for it oddly the more expensive ray ban polarized glasses in to 200300 range feel much heftier and the glass looks and feels thicker but seriously for over 100 bucks i expect better,1
so flattering on and comfy,2
i have a galaxy watch mens version that shows the length of the band is 22 when i seen this product i thought this is ideal and as a bonus i can switch out the bands unfortunately even though it says its for band width 22 its too short i am still using the band with the original pins but the pins are slightly bent so eventually theyre gonna go so if it wasnt for the fact that the pins are too short this would be an ideal product however it does not work for me so most likely i will have to send it back,1
cute,2
snagged and scratched right away,0
these seemed cheaply made and were way too tight,0
pretty much impossible to wear as a tragus earring the ball screws in the back rather than the front so you cant screw it in,0
very cute looks like the picture,2
the design is beautiful unfortunately it completely change colors only after being worn twice,0
the realbr purchased small im 54 135lbs good fitnot to tightbr pros comfortable shipped on time fit as expected good length similar to photobr cons shipped poorly see photo attached lines are not equally aligned see photos material slightly shiny and not the quality nor material expectedbr unable to decide at this time if i should return or wear as sleep wear nevertheless my recommendation would be to purchase a sold colorbr please hit helpful if my review helped you in anyway thank you so much,1
i ordered the size i normally wear with all jackets and tops fit was great wore it in alaska in the fall was rain resistant not waterproof but worked great with the light rains packed easily in my backpack lightweight but warm,2
this twopack is a great deal the shirts are wellmade in cotton blend and are a great fit as they are a bit longer than similar shirts,2
i shouldve known that the price was too good to be true it looks good wears well on the belt but it is made of cheap material and feels so i gave it a three instead of one because it does the job,1
i received this top on sunday and i couldnt wait to wear it i got a couple of compliments on it and people were surprised that it was ordered off amazonbr br i wish i had purchased the other colors sometime in the near future i will be ordering the brown one as well,2
could be worse to be fair its soft but the beanie was supposed to be solid brown however it appears two different shades were used which looks odd,0
i like this because of the blue on it and the n as it is my initial but it was very thin and small after just a few weeks the clasp started popping open,0
the size was perfect color was the light blue we wantedbr it was just what my daughter wanted and i neededbr arrived in a great timely mannerbr material is thicker than i imagined too which was great for covering her body toobr she felt very comfortable wearing it all day and even in front of the boys,2
i was disappointed in the quality of the watch band the leather guard that holds the band against the wrist broke the first time,1
defective attachment,0
these are actually super flimsy not really happy with the purchase at all i ordered an extra large because i normally wear a large and they are small on me so you may want to triple your size,1
pretty flattering fit material is a little thin but i layer it under a cardigan and its fine,2
this would be great for small chest girls its super cute and seems like good quality for the price the downside is im a 36 ddd and theres really no support for the girls at all definitely size up if you have a larger chest,1
they are made from very thin cloth no padding at all i got the small ones yet they still slide down during the course of the day,0
cute comfy but didnt wear them long ran small not the equivalent of muk like which i prefer decent for the price,1
awful cheap material its not sweatshirt material its cut you short if you know what i mean,0
one shoe fits one doesnt have worn vibrant shoes for years bought a size larger than my size re comments that they run small big hassle to return love vibrams but this type not right ugh,0
i love this tank top i cant stop wearing it its the perfect amount of cleavage without being too obvious,2
for the price you cant beat it i got this because i wanted a cheap replacement for my more expensive watch while i was trying to find a battery for it the battery for my nike watch ended up costing about half of the price of what this watch costs totalbr my peers says this makes me look really old but i think its rad it does what i need it too and thats all that mattersbr br updatebr during my second year of use while commuting on bike my watch fell off i found the case frameband interface cracked and propagated enough so that a portion of the watch case broke from the rest of the framebr br my fathers same watch has done the same unfortunately our watches broke at the frame and not the band therefore were now looking for something more robust like a gshock we take good care of our stuff even if its cheap so this is a big downer br br all in all its still a cool watch but not worth my money even at this price,1
support in all the wrong areas and the sizing is way off,0
very beautiful gold plated rings i was very happy with my purchase,2
thinly an cheaply made its a hard no for me,0
this jacket will keep you as warm as a tshirt would it almost zaps warmth idk how it does it but it does i bought as a fall jacket knowing it couldnt survive winter but dang it doesnt keep you warm at allbr br it fits tight i wear a small but got a medium to layer underneath with yet it is still tight with only one sweater underneath is oddly short too i got the longer version with the underlayer provided and it still comes to right at the top of my hips had wanted it longer br br overall its waaay overpriced it is made of crud materials and somehow sucks warmth out of you so it is not even wearable as a jacket in literally any weather though maybe itll keep you cool in summeri have yet to try this but heybr br please heed me and skip this as it is only coollooking off uncomfortable on and youll end up staring at it in mixed longing and fury as it hangs in your closet,0
this item was extremely disappointing did not look like picture at all disappointed and returned,1
i like the mask but it said pack of three when i itcherpurchased it and it was only one in the pack but other than that nice mask,1
would it kill companies that make scrub clothing to make them stretch in the groin its tighter than jeans,1
i have no idea what arch support they are talking about it has a soft moldable footbed and is quite comfortable for short walksbr they fit a good half size large now the plus of that is that if you have a larger volume foot these will be great for you,1
these earrings are really small i got the 5mm and it was still small,1
i got 2 one i kept the zipper broke first day but the one i had given to a friend and she loves it and used it all the time,1
bought these for a trip to canada got caught in the blizzard of 2022 worst in history feet were warm good for walking on snow or icebr glad to be home though oh canada,2
the pattern in the photo is absolutely stunning which made me take chances buying it despite the other reviews however the reviews are right the cut is weird and the middle section is very loose not fitted at all like the photo it creates a very boxy look id have to get it tailored and for the price its not worth it this was returned,0
the pair i received has one of the frog eyes sewn on backwards so its missing an eye fits smaller than expected i recommend getting a size up,1
i dont like this shirt at all it was scratchy and tight around the arms it is long though if you wanted to wear with leggings also it is just a light shirt not anything like a jacket,0
i adore this sweater i have gotten so many compliments on it because it is to beautiful and cute since it has snowmen i will wear it all winterbr the fabric is soft and just the right weight not heavy or bulky fit seems true to size to me its not meant to be fittedbr great quality and look for a minimal price tag very happy and ordered another one with a different design cant wait to get it,2
i bought this for my active stepdaughter she only had it on 1 day and it broke the next day i was so disappointed and felt so bad her crystal pendent fell off and chipped because the chain was so weak so awful do not recommend,0
in addition to being too narrow for a 13d these shoes have several uncomfortable spots that press into my feet the next evaluation will be how easy it is to return these to the seller and be credited which i assume will be no problembr br br update the seller accepted these back and credited my card immediately so no complaints just the wrong shoe for me ymmv,0
warm gloves but they run a little big,1
it is definitely a statement piece,2
its not really white sort of a cream color probably will be too warm in the summer to wear since is faux leather nice lenth,0
great shoe super comfy wore these on a trip to the iberian peninsula i was on my feet basically the whole time and my feet hardly got sore theyre also great for amusement parks only complaint is if they get wet they stay wet for a while and the cloth can get dirty there isnt arch support or anything but it isnt really a problem for me,2
they lasted my son one month and the crotch ripped out they were only worn about 4 times,0
i really loved the bracelet when it arrived but i wore it to work a few times and the blue beads color wore off disappointed to say the least but i really loved it,1
the shape is awkward and the cups are not adhesive enough they constantly fell off and i found myself awkwardly readjusting the bra under my shirt i purchased three and am throwing all of them out very poor product design,0
what a ripoff it does not even come with the wall plug there is a base a moderate quality cord and a piece of paper telling you to spend more money to use the thing,0
these shoes are great so soft and comfy when standing for hours,2
the dress was a good material and length was great i returned it because the fit was too small,1
this shirt is beautiful and soft and the colors are amazing but definitely size up a couple sixes ordered an extra large and it fits my 8 year old,0
come with holes,0
this bag is average for the price it has a smell to the material and it attracts lint easily as far as the structure of the bag id only expect to get a year or so out of it using it daily on the plus side its light weight it doesnt have an external mesh pocket for a water bottle i dont think it would protect a laptop or tablet very well as theres not much padding,1
52 176 lbs largebr br i like the dress but not a must have for the price pros comfortable and with a wedge shoe the length will work color is nice cons can find better quality for the price at other discount stores i would pay 10 if i saw it in a store but not 23 wrinkles easily after ironing with starch,1
i ordered 6xfits like 4xzipper is on wrong sidenice materialcheap so i kept it,0
though the price is low it is very poor quality the piece i received only has space for 4 photos unlike whats stated and pictured the hinges are very flimsy and the gold coating is cheap looking,0
these are the only shoes my great grandmother will wear she wears them out and always asks for the exact same pair for a replacement,2
really liked the pattern length but ripped after about 3 weeks of use really wanted to love these for my twists,1
i just didnt like them way too big,0
really them then i was just hoping they werent so thin my kiddo will rip this in a day or two,1
this is a nice scarf it is much shorter than the photo though,1
definitely better on the model than in person the pattern on the sleeves is really strange and it just looks like two broken sweaters stitched into one not crazy about it and had to return,0
super thin,1
as always you can be as big as a house or as tiny as a mouse but if you are talljust forget it youre not gonna get a size to suit long legs,0
its a beautiful soft orange i love it anf it looks amazing on my daughter,2
works well to keep my hubs pants up he needs it,2
the color on the pendant turned silver after 1 week but the chain is a good gold color,1
first i really want to appreciate the flared long cut of this blazer as someone with an hourglass body shape but long torso its hard to find blazers that are flatteringeither they cut off well above my hips or are too rectangular and fit poorlybr br another plus is that the blazer feels very substantial and has appropriate stiffnessstructure so many blazers on amazon at this price point are floppy thin cardigans masquerading as blazersbr br however the tweed pattern is printed onto a satiny fabric at the price i fully expected that the tweed pattern would be printed but the sheen from the fabric makes it look way cheaper than if the tweed pattern were printed on a matte fabric or else the fabric were offered in a solid colorbr br i ended up returning because of this but i would happily buy this blazer in a solid color if it were offered because i was otherwise really happy with the shape and heftbr br fit the fit is on the snugger side from the size chart in the description i would go up a size if you want to wear anything more substantial than a thin closefitting shirt or camisole underneath,1
had this for a while works good,2
fits big,1
im normally a medium im 53 and 135 and it was really big,1
but not great either was a starter buy and has been used a few times a bit itchy on my breasts because of the lace pretty sure the thong wore out a while ago didnt feel like it was worth the 40 should have been 2025,1
good quality cute dress i would size up i ordered my size based on the chart and had to send it back because it was too tight,2
very pretty no issues easy buy,2
i waisted my money they dont fit unless you are a 2 year old then they might fit,0
love thiese shoes there great,2
sadly i would not recommend this sweatshirt it much larger than expectbr next i was actually thinking this would be sweatshirt material it was notbr it like paper inside not fleece as expect cute but not what i thought i was orderingbr lastly when i went to return it they want to charge you 595 and would discount your return to compensate for the return charge not at all what you would think when being a prime customer,0
not as transparent as i was expecting,1
nothing to complaint comfortable good fit looks nice good material quality prefer the brown color than the black pair,2
quality of the material is not great but the style pattern and fit are lovable packaging was torn when i received it,1
fit was consistent with other similar flip flops ive purchased a wideenough foot bed without looking clunky soles were not at all slippery on rug tile or hardwood floors they would have been returned immediately if they were straps comfortablea little low but hold your feet in place no discomfort between toes no breakin required my first try of this brand but likely wont be my last no evidence of whether theyre made in chinahoping theyre not,2
fits very small im normally a medium in every brand sometimes a small i ordered a large in this and it was too small to be comfortable for me especially with this kind of fabric that shows every bump and imperfection order 2 sizes up unless your body is perfect also the string for the ties came seperate so i would have to thread them not a big deal if i loved the top other wise but just annoying,0
the tshirt itself is fine and appears to be of decent quality poor roaldy looks like he had a heck of a rough night though very washed out and not at all as pictured on the product page ill still wear it but im pretty bummed,0
had to return because it was way too short and way too wide,0
i really loved the style of this jacket and i went by the manufacturers size chart but it was still too small all over as other have said this is a thin fabric more like a very light trench coat but i think it would have been nice had it fit,0
im an xl tall slender i ordered a 2x and it was sort of snug so i gave it to my wife i ordered the 3xl and it was a perfect fit,1
its a great hat but while my hat is blue the flouncy trim is also blue instead of white as pictured and the fascinator is completely different i still love it but,2
so comfortable and cute run big tho i should of sized down but its ok ima still wear them,1
i only have had the bracelet since march 7th and it just broke right where the clasp hooks onto the small little circle pretty disappointed i really did like it will be calling amazon customer service for a refund,0
cute good quality but didnt fit the top edge dug into my foot painfully sadly had to return,0
these shorts tore within one month of used and washed regularly go with an actual athletics brand,0
welp unfortunately they arent for thick thighs they comes up high while leaving a dent and sadly the socks rolls right on down 3 stars for them coming up over my knee,1
bigger than i expected but its a very beautiful bag and the quality is also good,2
very nice sweater but runs way too small have tried a small a medium and both were way too tight,0
awesome color variety fits perfect cool storage bag worth every penny,2
my mom loved this dress great for warm weather,2
bought these for a harley quinn costume they go perfectly and fit great,2
these earrings were lovely they were pretty they were dainty but not too small they are pretty versatile and will work for a great deal of settings and people i think they would be good for anyone from a child to an adultbr br i thought these were unique they came packaged nicely the quality seemed goodbr br they were very comfortable to wear they were flattering on they felt secure on my ears i thought they were a reasonable value i would recommend thembr br it is nice that they are real sterling silver,2
just right,2
my wife loves these so much she ordered another pair in a different color just as good as betabrand that cost twice as much,2
i wanted to like this dress but the seam in the middle just irritated me to death also its a bit short for the taller ladies im 6 the fabric is a good weight and its a nice cut for work if you are less than 5634 unfortunately i had to return it,1
this purchase was a disappointment very poor quality do not buy,0
you cant return these boots and amazon wont return them either they run two sizes two small dont buy from this store vendor you will be out of 50 pretty upset amazon didnt return these,0
they really hurt my eyes,0
perfect ordering 1 of every color,2
item description is misleading or they sent me the wrong ones these are round and black but they are just regular cotton shoe laces there is absolutely no elastic to them,0
i dont know why but in all my nike shoes i wear size 9 but these ones are large like one number in the other hand the texture of the rubber on the shoes keep clay over it and look to dirty in just one game,1
bought this for my wife for christmasso that is what3 weeks agoits already ripping and falling apart with daily use,0
too small to wear with jeans a d boots might be okay for young girls,1
very cloudy so they were hard to see not labeled venice murano glass,0
i washed these masks when they were delivered cold water hung them dry they shrunk so bad i never got to wear them,0
these fit nicely over my glasses and keep out the glare theyre cute although the red isnt a true redmore of a rusty red i will wear them any how,2
purchased for a party so they will do the trick if you have short fingers and small hands the tips of gloves may b a little long but they are fine for my purposes and they extend a little above elbows also a cute little hair tie was included as a little xtra,1
fit is really wide and short daughter wears it as a shirt have to tie it up in the back to keep it from falling down in front and after about 3 washes its falling apart,0
this watch band is definitely not a real red this is also hard to get off of the watch itself,0
they run a little small otherwise fabric is breathable and good for working out,1
size large fits my slightly tall 8 year old but was far too small for my somewhat short 13 year old,0
they block out the sun good quality,2
seem thin,2
the perfect shoe fo business casual or just casual you can wear them with chino type pants or jeans look great either way,2
very cheesy material,1
material not good,0
good for mild winters,1
band sewn on the bottom of the shirt that doesnt show in most photos and not in description it causes the bottom of the shirt to pucker instead of laying flat on your hips also runs short,1
i accidentally ordered the large instead of medium it is massive the brim is just above my chin when i put it on so almost my entire head fits inside it id recommend this size only if you have a very very big head or a ton of long hair that you plan on putting up into the hat it does have a drawstring inside to tighten it but that just makes it rest higher up temporarily until it eventually settles again it just looks weird that way too it does collapse but kind of leaves small lines in it once you reform it i am returning it but will probably reorder in the smaller size it seems well made not as lightweight as id like but i feel like it offers better sun protection this way a tighter thicker weave,1
i purchased these mens slipper socks for my husband he is 64 and wears size 12 he could not even get the sock over his foot because the outer material does not stretch i tried them on and it was awkward to put them on due to the tight outer material but they fit my 8 12 size foot perfectly the inside material is super soft they seem well made these run small and should not be advertised as fitting over size 9 do not order for an adult male they are too small,0
followed the sizing chart i shouldve needed 2xl i bought 3xl waist was slightly loose that was what i wanted but bending or squatting and im about to split the material definitely didnt do the spacing right for the butt or thigh cuts its way too snug compared to the length and the waist measurements,0
well made and attractive but a little small,1
material is rough and clinches staticfilled no matter what i do,0
the picture is very misleading you think its going to be more of a dress but the slit on the sides literally go up past your belly button so youd have to wear shorts with this regardless not happy with this at all,0
ordered the one woth this pattern and a solid black the solid black is the only one usable as when i attempts to switch between my different straps the patterned ones quick release rods fall out which makes it impossible to quickly change to my attire,1
58 size 4 140 pounds typically wear a medium these fit perfectly and were so comfortable i was worried after reading some of the reviews but they were the right length wore with a 34 in heel i received compliments all night from girls guys gays big hit 1010 recommend i even washed them before wear and they held up line dry,2
little on the small side i have average size handarms,1
adorable,2
ordered to wear at my daughters wedding it looks so pretty however product arrived in a bag that was torn open the dress was inside out and wrinkled it didnt fit when i tried to return it they said it was custom made so no refund it is still in my closet waiting for someone who is a size 6 not 14,0
posts are easy too short i should have returned but it was too late they hurt my 3 year old daughters ears so she took them out and lost one,0
biggest gripe is that on the week back from my trip luckily not on the trip so with one weeks usage the neck cord caught on something and i pulled my neck up and it snapped yes not ideal use case but it wasnt that much of a wrench so if someone were to tug at the strap and flee it would come apart without much problem and it started unravelling one of the sections passport section at the top its lightweight but in more ways than one alas,0
absolutely love these glass the shape and color is perfect for me ive gotten so many compliments too,2
it will fit any size but if you are over size 10 like me its not going to fit in a way that looks nice also the materials are not what i would choose for this style of belt very hard to keep the ties tied,0
they are nice i got them to put in my 14 year old suns retro 8 jordans and he says that they hurt his feet a little at first and his shoes creased very little not enough to even be noticed while standing locking down overall a great product and a great buy,2
material is very thin and cheap turtle neck collar is too small so it doesnt shape properly closer to a high neck tshirt than turtle neck,0
too small,0
nice tank top but way too large i ordered a small and it fits like a large,1
item fits nicely but poorly stitched sent it back for a refund will reorder in hopes of a better one,1
the compass and the temperature dont work i guess it is for show only,0
shrunk boxy cotton short and not comfy at all,0
this is a great purse its well made very pretty its exactly what i was looking for in a purse,2
did not fit at all,0
only fits6watches butitsok box,1
nice and cool,2
love these shorts perfect length and super comfortable,2
bought for someone with sensory issues she is very happy with them,2
i wasnt happy that it was tight they didnt say it came smaller than usual,1
the quality was great for the price however i am 59 and this was a good 23 inches from the floor i would not recommend if you want something floorlengthbr br my measurementsbr height 59 69inchesbr weight 190 lbsbr bust 35 bra 36 cbr waist 32br hip 44,2
my granddaughter loved this fit her 3t size perfectly top doesnt curl up and bottoms stay in place i have not used it with swim diapers yet and it looks like that might be a bit tight as the pants are perfect now,2
very thin material paint legs where way too long there was a defect in the material i returned the item for a refund,0
kinda thin and stitching isnt sturdybut will due its job,1
good quality soft material and washes well i hang to dry,2
quality not very good,0
this purse is beautifully made for a child it is unbelievable small ya might be able to carry a tube of lip stick what a disappointment,0
really cute but the neck was too big,1
the shirt was stiffer than it looks in the picture and wrinkled easily i was expecting a better drape,1
loveeee super comfy has phone pocket,2
not as warm as i expected well made but the insulation is quite thin need to investigate other options may return,1
this shoe looks very sexy on but is very tight around the widest part of your foot had it not been for that i would rate 5 stars my plan is to see if they can be altered by a shoe shop before my first outing they are too hot to return,1
these protective sleeves were very thin and were not very long others at about the same price are better quality wick away sweat better and cover most of the arm as well as the forearm,1
the 34xl34 slippers were much too small for my size 12 feet but amazon provided an effortless means for returning them with no cost to me excellent system for achieving customer satisfaction,0
wasnt really happy with the material but its ok,2
im 51034 med build with 33 waist and 30 inseam i have a couple of the smalls and they fit lengthwise just right but the waist can be a little snug thought id try the medium so i ordered one and although the waist was a good fit the length was a couple inches too long,1
sending it back it was not a 25 stone and very blue,0
the colors look nothing like the pic its basically hot pink not red and the material is like spandex or something else very synthetic that fits smug to the body,0
these boots smell really bad they smell like really cheap plastic shoes they dont stay up,1
was a tad too loose but its to be expected not always easy to buy a mens shirt for a girl super comfy and i love the shirt i wear it all the time in the cooler weather,2
cute,1
garbage,0
the fit was generous and i could have easily bought one size smaller than the chart indicated the material was okay not great and a bit stiff but not terrible dress is fully lined with some boning in the bodice for support so it would not require a bra if your chest filled it up which mine did not even come close 44c in the photos i loved the style but in person it was not flattering on wide hipsbutt and it looked more like a mother of the bride dress than anything a 30something year old would wearbr returning it was a pain because seller wanted to offer alternatives like i could resell the dress before allowing a return and also kept commenting on how it was made to the sizes on the chart and basically it was my fault it didnt fit even though i never said it didnt fit it was plenty roomy and i planned to have it altered if i had liked it but i had to keep telling them i just didnt like it and i wanted a return for full refund once i was given the return address in the us i had to ship it back at my expense and provide emailed documentation of tracking number and shipping receipt they later reimbursed me once the dress was received back just not worth the hassle and the wait for it to arrive in the first place,0
looks cute fits perfect nice material doesnt look like its made to last with a playful 8 year old but she loves it,1
just what i was looking for fast shipping good quality,2
ok but not for me,1
my son wont wear it so,0
its alright,1
perfect little wallet bag more please complement this bad then i get when i carry my coach purse,2
i bought this bag for a recent trip to india i wanted something that would be able to carry all of my daily items comfortably and this bag delivered i was able to fit in a notebook large water bottle hand sanitizer dslr camera wallet tissues and other items compared to the purse i usually carry this was really comfortable and didnt cause any strain on my backbr br cons the rope has started to fray should be any easy fix by cutting off the flyaways but i wish theyd have braided it tighter or something and the black color although stylish collects dust really easilybr br even so i highly recommend this bag,2
love these socks bought a pair at a local shoe store and liked them so much i bought two more pair on amazon theyre sturdy without being overly thick and they fit snuggly yet comfortably ive bought all the patterns and wish they had even more,2
i got these socks for my granddaughter they are very cute and we both like how they look but the quality is terrible as far as durability she wears big holes in the bottom under the heel after wearing them only a few times this is not a problem she has had with other socks for that reason i would not recommend them the cute design does not make up for how fast they wear out,0
never knew thigh highs could be this comfortable until i tried these on,2
i wanted something inexpensive rugged for outings such as amusement parks water resistant was also a requirement i dont know how many purses have been ruined or stained over the years on water rides or roller coasters theres lots of pockets the strap is adjustable and will adjust long enough for a cross bodybr br this purse isnt high fashion so dont expect it to be its a knockaround mom bag one you wouldnt mind putting on the floor in the movie theater beach or sporting events etc its not something you would be embarrassed to carry though its understated unassumingbr br you might even be able to get away with using it as a small diaper bag there are two pockets on the sides that would perfectly fit baby bottles too small for water bottles though,2
was great when i first tried it on after the first wash the shirt shrank,0
they are okayscuffed very easily,1
i did not like how this bra fit and sent it back,0
paper thin material has no body and gets wrinkled easily,1
gift for my daughter and she loves them,2
i have worn merrells for years and have 5 pairs of various styles these ran very narrow in the toes even after i went a size up i was massively disappointed because i walked the soles smooth on my old ones and needed a replacement at the moment i will have to hike barefoot i am at a loss,0
the reason i gave it only 2 stars is because the strap burst the first day i have a bad foot so i cant run or jump so it broke with just casual walking,0
the picture above shows a bodyglove swimtop in d cup size with the medium top below for size reference you can see how wide the top is big cups and thin straps that cant tighten enough not enough supportbr br this set is a gamble as far as fit is concerned the problem with most bikini sets is that a lot of women arent the same size in top and bottom im 57 120 lbs and ordered a mediumbr br im slim but i do have a larger bust 32dd so with sets i usually size up to mediumsbr br firstly the design of this swimsuit is very cute i like the small ruffles and pinstripes very sweet and femininebr br but sadly only half of the suit fit the bottoms fit great perfectly high waisted flattering on the butt but the top is very big for a medium it has those firmerstiffer foam cups you see in push up swimsuits sometimes i was excited to see this top is a tie top bc having a larger bust with a small band size is really tricky with swim tops but the back straps in the swim top are sewn far out so you cant tie the straps very tight without the back straps getting in the way see pic id say youd have to be like a 3638 to have it tie correctly theyre not very thick straps either so they dont seem to be able to support the weight from the foam front wellbr br i do really like the bottoms and wish this set would have worked for me but the ill fitting top is why i would give it 35br br hope this has been helpful,1
i just got the kit it seems ok enough but how the hell are you supposed to connect to loop to the needle so that you can get the ring thru your piercing they dont connect and im not piercing expert but in what ive seen the jewelry connects to the needle and is then pulled thru the piercing maybe im missing something here but i cant figure it out,1
the bathing suit was beyond flattering but when i received it the silver clasp on the back was broken,1
i just must have received a defective caftan i am a size 12 and it was tight i measure and seam to seam at the hip area was only 22 across disappointed because it is really pretty and exactly what i wanted in terms of style returning,0
its a nice fit and i have a few of these but they have all gotten pilly over time and i dont put them in the dryer so now they are for around the house only,1
this is very flimsy cheaply made and not worth buying,0
i really liked this dress material was nice and i liked the pockets would be really cute on the boardwalk with sandals or even a pair of vans fyi the bottom is fitted so when u walk it small strides lol but to throw over your head and go to the beach bar its perfect,2
purple to this company is not at all what youd think of as purple neat features but maybe too many pockets canvas is very unattractive i returned it,0
love it,2
did not fit right sizing was inconsistent with other styles from same brand,1
kind of thin and cheap but ok if you just want to take something tiny in your pocket or pocketbook,1
she wants you to know these tanktops make her feel sexy af highly recommend for the price comfortable for housewear and athleticwear,2
ordered this hoodie arrived as a crew neck sweatshirt wound up keeping it as my kid didnt care but definitely not as shown or described,0
very nice,2
this fit my daughter better than expected i was a little nervous with the sizing i ordered a size 100 which is 23 my daughter is 3 but still wears size 2t in us sizes it fit like it should however if you have a 3 year old who wears 3t i would size up the material is really good quality for the price i will order a few more as she grows,2
love the sweater however i ordered 5 different colors and not one matches the color shownbr beware of this,1
it was a gift and she likes it,1
all perfect and shipping very fast,2
they are not cute like the pic makes my feet sweat and became stinky i never did read anywhere how to clean these so im gonna just throw them into the washer and hope for the best would not buy again because of the sweating even though they are vey comftyand ugly im sorry the more i consider its just a no for me,1
these are fine pants for your occasional swim the best part perhaps is their brightness its always a risk for dark pants that people cant see you if youre stuck at the bottom of the pool but the bright yellows and greens on this make it much easier to spot you underwater they also look good its a very beachy appearance however the quality seems a bit lacking when they came in there were threads hanging off and the seams themselves look very haphazard so itll hold up to the occasional swim but probably isnt something for more serious swimmers who will be using and washing these very often,1
even after several washes this robe is so soft and beautiful i love the pinkgray plaid against my gray hair i only wish it were a little longer as it falls just below the knees this shorter length makes is more of a cool summerspring fall robe than a winter robe unless paired with pj pants overall a great value for the money,2
not good for standing all day,0
the picture is adorable so i was excited for it to arrive but the product is not the same as the picture the swimsuit is navy blue with the bottom being navy and baby blue and the bottoms are cut just like regular swim suit bottoms not a retro fit like i was expecting the top is lined with a heavy bra pad the bottoms are not lined and im usually a size small but just gave birth 4 weeks ago so i ordered a medium but it was so tight and uncomfortable i really should have ordered a large didnt realize it came from china until after i ordered if i did i would have ordered a larger size from the start as chinese clothes usually run small,0
looks nothing like the picture in the ad,0
cute shirt but it runs insanely big the 06 month should not be advertised for anything smaller than 6 month old,0
i love packing cubes they keep everything organized while traveling plus if your luggage should fall open then all your stuff isnt everywhere i had larger packing cubes but i needed smaller ones and these bagail 8pcs lightweight luggage packing organizers packing cubes are tiny compared to the ones that i have however they will be perfect for underwear accessories and other smaller items they are pretty thin and im concerned about durability i wont know because no one in the us can travel due to covid but having traveled quite a bit with packing cubes i think these should do the trick for a couple of trips the downside is the color i would prefer something darker either gray or black because since these are protecting my clothes and accessories they will get dirty,1
wonderful,2
very small appears to be childsized also feels like its made from craft store felt huge disappointment for the price will be returning,0
i really like the pants other than the first day wearing them one of the zippers stopped working and i got a small hole in the flap next to another zipper little scared theyre going to fall apart quickly,1
muy bueno,2
absolute junk,0
its a great concept and i like the attempt this company has made the outer shorts are great and i like the look and feel of them the compression shorts are not very comfy they arent quite underwear or compression its a really weird feel i recommend going with a pair of compression shorts that have the pocket and going with a regular pair of shorts if you are wanting to work out and have the pocket for phone and keys at least that way youd have the compression benefit,1
extremely thin and delicate pretty and silk,2
the colors match my purse perfectly the strap is a good size,2
nice shirt too small across the chest area,1
fun dress go down a size,2
this dress was deliver disgusting first of all it wasnt the right dress and it came stinking like perfume and covered in stains very unhappy,0
i ordered 2xl and it feels like a 4xl after i washed them it felt like the shirt was for more wider people,0
it didnt fit at all waaaaayyyy to small,0
very bad quality bought a size 36months for my 5month old 15lbs baby and it was tooo big,0
this was a nice bracelet but not good quality the string was easy warrant not something that you could wear every day,1
age 35 57 200 lbs i got this as i thought maybe this would be modest enough to walk around in before bedmiddle of the night but yet slightly sexier than old tshirts i normally wear ya know spice things up a bit well um its not sexy it is nothing like the pic although she is sexy and thin so maybe that is why ive got some thickness on me but this thing hangs it sags the buttons dont really keep it closed which is super weird because this is certainly not tight on me think hospital gownish but with a front closure i was wearing it though cuz i was hoping i was over analyzing this but then my teenager saw me in it one morning and started laughing and said i looked like my old aunt who wears old sleeping dresses around aka mumu dress but if you are looking for that this is certainly comfortable has a nice soft fabric and doesnt get bunched around my legs at night,1
cute earrings and nice quality look like the picture,2
no where near 42 belt poor quality,1
i have been wearing hokas for 7yrs now havent found any other running shoes that match their comfort i thought these were just too cute so i went ahead and got them i wore them to work once im a nurse and im on my feet for 12hrs these will be just for running errands on my days off even with extra cushion support added these are not comfortable for anything but light use,1
color is fine and the pants should hold up over time because this is maidenformbr br however the pants ride up roll up at the legs and the material is more like spanks than my more comfortable underwear i wont buy this style again,0
very cute i always get lots of compliments in this shirt fits super cute and the design is great in person as well,2
runs small cheap price cheap material you get what you pay for,0
is supposed to be 3 caps but unfortunately 2 was delivered thats was look ripoff to me,0
i dont have very wide feet i usually fit in a normal shoe width shoe however these were narrow and i felt like the sides of my feet could slip off they are cushy and comfy if im sitting with my feet propped up would be cute if i didnt have to walk i wish they came in a wider width cause id reorder,1
slacks arrived after the event but they fit well look good on him,1
broke the first time they fell out of my pocket im only 5 so my pocket is only a 1 drop lol,0
i bought this as a gift and my friend loves it,2
its a looks identical as pictured its so comfy you could sleep in it i think its very good at hiding me belly very flattering,2
the quality feels nice and is very soft the detail is not as bright as the pictures looked for the all black the sleeves are too long and wide at the hands and the midsection is not flattering im slim it would fit if i had a belly returning,1
this product is horrible fabric is very bad quality socks of the same are different sizes they rippoff,0
i would give it a five star but the color is more mustard than pictures i was expecting more yellow,1
these run surprisingly narrow and a little bit smaller than im used to they still fit me well mostly because i prefer a narrow shoe,2
it is fine as a v neck tshirt but does not have the same loose drape as in the photo i am keeping it because it is okay but it isnt what i wanted,0
i accidently ordered two of same dress returnedreturning both materail was heavier than expected not a good fitlook on me,0
it is really cute but too short i gave it to someone,1
i like the flare look but the fit i was not happy with,1
cute silver anklets for any occasion some have two or three strands of cuteness my girls absolutely love these,2
these arrived with a big hole on the side will stitch myself as easier than returning and reordering cute gloves,1
all around perfect fit great wearable and so fun every little girl needs 1 or 5 of them,2
the main reason that i got this button up shirt was because of the color variation and lookbr br at first the shirt seemed great it fit perfectly but that is when i noticed a big problem the buttons are on the opposite side it is super annoying having to button it up and that is not where the problem ends the hole where the buttons go through seem to have another accidental hole every time i button up the shirt it goes right through the hole that its not supposed to go through and removing the button from there is always a pain also the quality of the shirt itself is okay not the best and not the worstbr br honestly if this shirt had the buttons and the button holes fixed i wouldnt mind using it at all i think this product deserves 3 out of 5 stars i hope this review helps you make an educated purchasing decision,1
these are the best compression socks i am an rn and work 13 hour shiftsmy legs now feel refreshed and no more arch or calf pain love them i am going to order a pair for my daughter,2

videoid4e1a139ed7e1f1e4db422a77f663b04e nice bag i have also included a video review which i hope clarifies some of the written portion andor augments it to allow you to get an idea of the ins and outs of the bag as i mentioned in the video prottoni has to garment bags on amazon both of which are very well made and well thought out designs and i believe made with different consumer needs in mindbr br featuresbr 2 large pocketsbr 6062these pockets are deep and extend the length of the bag each is zippered shut and each is wide open meaning it does not contain additionalbr organization features you may have seen in similar type luggage such as extra pockets for organization functionally this makes sense asbr anything in this type of pocket would fall out when the bag is hung in the open position and you would thus lose the organizational benefitbr shoulder strap with comfort guardbr 6062unlike the 44 inch model this trap attaches to opposite points of the bag on the same side this is made possible by the reinforcementbr location along the top side of the bagbr dual clip closure in folded positionbr 6062this is a key difference between this model and the 44 inch model this models is opened much quicker and easier with the dual clip designbr see video as opposed to the 44 inch model which has a 180 degree zipperbr single hand carry rigid strapbr 6062another key difference between this model and the 44 inch this handle is rigid plastic and looks very elegant and professional it is situatedbr along the reinforced metal side which maintains the bag shape when all of the weight is focused on the center during hand carryingbr the main hook that the entire bag hangs from in the open position is a single nylon strap seen in the photo at the bottom of the bag and is attached via two metal latches the other model has a metal hook connected to a nylon strap that serves this purposebr full internal zipper closure with snap on flapbr strap on inside that keeps items in place with snap clip closure the 44 inch model has a strap which is closed via two loops see videobr a bottom reinforcement which maintains the bag in its rectangular form while hanging from the wall so that the contents remain more viewable and less deformablebr br i dont believe there were any drawbacks to this bag i have used both this model and the other on trips and think they were both made well with different users in mind so please also check out my review on the 44 inch prottoni bag to compare and contrast the two and make an informed buying decisionbr br i received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest unbiased review,2
i was really happy to order this ocean jasper necklace but this was only a pendant have to order a necklace to put it on the photo shows it on a necklace so i thought it came togetherbr have to wait another week to get the necklace part i ordered separately,0
too small and feels soooo cheap there was a knife mark on it too not worth the hassle to return it it went to goodwill,0
giftable order size to big but we save them kid will grow up,2
very comfortable great fit really nice socks,2
fit perfectly,2
these are great i am used to wearing normal socks as i really like socks but i recently got a pair of shoes where socks just look rather silly with i was excited to give these a try with them since i just stopped wearing the shoes altogether i really love wearing sock i didnt think these would really be as good as they are but they were perfect just what i needed these are perfect socks for those shoes that need to have socks not seen but you just have to wear them the socks are super soft and dont bunch or slip when worn they also dont shrink or lose softness after the first wash i dont know about any wash after the first because ive only gotten that farbr these are very good socks and i recommend them,2
nice clamps good design but they are plastic,2
fit too big and has a velcro strap which is great for kids,0
i ordered based on the size chart and the fit was extremely small could not get the loose fit,0
bought this for my husband and it is very small,0
actually made night driving worse,0
absolutely love this it works perfectly great quality for the price i can wear it all day and it is extremely comfortable,2
this has been my goto outfit this summer for going out shopping ive worn it about 6 times and was ready to buy it in more colors i bent down to pick something up last night and it split at the crotch as much as i loved it i thought id at least get a season or two out of it,1
does the job but looks cheap,1
fit is great and the pants are really nice only issue is that they are a bit warmer than expected,2
cute pair hugs nucely,2
i got the right size but theyre just sort of stubbyshort a larger size wouldnt fit properly they also make your feet look smaller which is a plus if youre not a plussize woman which i am very comfy for the right person im sure,1
bought two pairs one was broken as soon as i opened bag very cute bite poorly made,0
baggy fit,0
great quality i truly enjoy receiving things i buy online and it is exactly what i ordered no tricks no disappointments i gave it as gift to a male and it fits perfect a little heavy for a small women but great necklace set,2
so light and so comfy loved it for my son,2
too small find fit,0
if you are thinking about buying these do it they are worth it they are by far the best no show footie socks i have ever boughtbr br i looked and looked at reviews all over amazon and everyones complaint was always that they slipped off their heel i wore these all day and they never even thought about sliding off my heel there is a no slip grip all the way around the opening of the sock not just on the heel i was pleasantly surprisedbr br when i first put them on i thought oh goodness these are small because they do feel a bit tiny but once i got them on and wiggles my foot around they felt greatbr br and i will say this if you have long toenails you will likely put a hole in the toe its not because these are cheap its because they are made of lace lace is just in general a delicate material the bottom is made out of a slightly thicker and more comfortable material thoughbr br i wore these with bobs shoes and you could just barely see them sticking out of the top but i blame that on my skinny feet it doesnt bother me the least little bitbr br the next test was washing them they come with a delicate bag and i used that i washed on a delicate cycle with other clothes on cold and did not dry them i let them air dry they came out perfectly finebr br these are amazing like i said if youre thinking about it just buy them you will be glad you did,2
this belt is great its a really thick nylon material much thicker than most nylon belts and the buckle is interesting how it loosens and tightens without holes you can tighten the belt down in probably 116 increments to find a perfect fit it was too long so i just cut the belt off and used a lighter on the end so it doesnt fray worked great the buckle looks pretty nice for a nylon belt too overall very happy with it,2
these are perfect for the lake park and outdoor trips i am terrible about losing hard and visors but at this price its not a problem,2
i love the style of this and the way it looks but the stripes for the sleeves at the bottom arent knit in theyre sewn that means you can feel where theyve been sewn on which is a bit aggravating to my sensitive skin i have scars on my arms that the seams rub i got this one larger than my normal size because i like to wear things loose but i can see how ordering in your own size might make the arms pretty tight definitely designed for smaller asian girls in mind or anyone with a build similar really minus the seams the fabric is comfortable and easy to clean not too thick so you can wear it as a regular indoor shirt or under another jacket if it werent for the seam and arm width problem it would have had a 5,1
these are great typical ball caps dont fit my sons head they look like a childs hat on an adults head these fit him perfectly and dont ride up,2
i like the print on these pants i ordered one size bigger after looking at the size chart and they fit,2
not a solid construction,1
i loved thisuntil i washed it and the pictures peeled off too late to return it but really disappointed,0
very heavy material i thought this was a 2 piece but it is just a single very professional looking seems well made,1
everytime i moved in this shirt it was slipping and sliding all over couldnt stand the feel,0
pleasantly surprised at these bras fit perfect very lightly padded nice uplift and support and comfortable what else could you want from an everyday bra and the price is really great,2
pretty but fell apart after a few weeks and had to replace with something else,0
i love the fit this is a great skort to run in and it looks great,2
it was big and long,1
im a basketball player and i had a problem in my nose but i needed to buy this so i can keep playing its comfortable for the first 45 minutes i train 2 hours a day and my team runs a lot so i cant take it out during practice you have to be constantly cleaning the transparent part located in the nose because if you dont your vision its not going to be as its best when you fit it to your size the bands pop out and there is nothing to hold them so i found that very annoying but it does protect your nose,1
these are soooo comfy and look really cute on and i love that the soul is suede on the inside instead of a slick leather that can get slimy when feet sweat very nonslip on the bottom of the sole as well they fit exactly as expected for a size 8 foot,2
okay,1
garbage horrible material,0
good quality tie,2
my daughter loves her new swim suit the color is true and it is made well the underarmor brand name isnt in your face which is also very nice shes not a walking advertisement,2
i really want to like these but the waist band pulls in to to tight they are so comfy with the legs a little long but the waste elastic is so uncomfortable,1
very nice but not true size,1
good quality fabric floats well and not binding at allgood stretchi am almost 58 and it hits right at my anklebr i normally wear a 1618 and i ordered this and it fits snuggly where it should in the top and arms and flows nicely in the bottom,2
if you wear a regular width dont order the narrow the buckle will be on the last bucklebr and tightbr other than that i did buy them in a store in regular width ive had 3 surgeries on same foot and they are surprisingly comfy once you get the bucklebr where its comfy for you leave them alone slide your foot in and enjoy,1
for 7 cant beat this shirt it rivals the 10 ones at target and kohls enjoy,2
just beware that these have no structure they are quite difficult to pack because of this i have no choice but to keep them since i need them for a trip in two days but if i had been smart enough to order them earlier i would be returning them for something less flimsy,0
love the color fit until the sole cracked every time i step there is a pop its very uncomfortable return window closed yesterday of course if seller will send me a replacement i will change my review,0
this item ships from china while the quality is good the size is very very small it is not anything like the size shown in the picture its a good size for a 12 year old but not for an average or plus sized woman,1
fit was fine but the peplum style was not done correctly which in my mind would have been gradually so it poofed out on the side making it look ridiculous so i had to return it,0
its a cool tshirt,2
perfect for rex basketball for my daughter,2
cant get them on,0
these are pretty and comfy i ended up walking 3 miles in the heat one day and i dont reccomend that but its not the shoes fault im out of shape they were still good and i wore them again the next day nice enough for work casual enough for day to day excellent choice at a good price,2
very soft and comfortable but wrinkle prone order at least one size larger,2
i ordered a small it is extra long and too big i returned it,1
is neither adjustable nor a bracelet charm feels plastic,0
these mask are beautiful which caught my eye however the material is not breathable i was disappointed,1
they are cheaply made i wore one to sleep in one night and the seams look like they are coming apart already it doesnt stay on your head,0
the print is pretty but i was expecting cotton not polyester satin its ok but im disappointed,1
comfortable i prefer a tighter fit for safety,1
broken earrings need i say more,0
pretty small for mens sizing warm but stiff not nearly as long as in picture,1
48 in strings were actually 46 in,0
i really like these yoga pants they fit well wash up great and feel comfortable in addition to the fit and comfort i especially like the bonus of pockets which hold keys change and a phone in addition im 58 and the length of these pants is perfect,2
i like the design the vent take a way from the patch work on the side all in all the shirt is as advertised,1
looks and feels like its well made the zipper is somewhat industrial like and works easily interior has many pockets that easily contain about a dozen different cards organized im glad i bought it since it looks like it will last a long time i would buy again if needed,2
nothing extraordinary about this item cheaply made and it shows as such when worn,1
these socks are a good quality terrific grippers vibrant colors have not washed yet so im hoping its colorfast the size is good but i feel run short my grandson has shorter feet for is height and the socks just make it but allinall he says theyre comfortable and loves them,2
these are very large in comparison to other underwear using the same dimensions for their size chart also the leg holes seem to be odd i figured since they were cotton maybe they would shirk a lot after a wash so i gave them a wash and they were still pretty big then stretched even more after a few hours of wear very disappointing,0
using these tops for tennis matches comfy,2
i thought this would be soft its not that soft im not going to return it but for the money it cost it really wasnt worth it the pattern is pretty but im worried it will start to fade after a couple washes,1
i have bought 4 pairs both of my sons and i love hey dudes they are very comfy when they get dirty i spray some stain stuff on them and throw them in the washer look brand new again,2
was broken and very cheap when arrived jewels missing price not worth the trouble of a return do not recommend,0
i was under the idea they were three different sizes,2
i got the mesh version of the hat and as a couple others have mentioned the top front of the hat is very pointy looking it looks fairly dumb aside from that the rest of the hat is decent,0
i only bought it to use the little holster for a tag heuer watch and the experiment turned out great,2
zaful needs to get with the program large is huge and the medium gas bottoms that fit but a top that is tiny you cant order separate sizing stupid sending this suit back and keeping one only for the bottoms basically throwing the top away the material seems ok for the price,0
comfortable and seem durable,2
better than the ones that attach to your socks would be these again,2
its cute just a little bit shorter than i was expecting its not cropped but it sure is close i didnt find it particularly cooling but it wasnt warm either the little flair at the bottom is adorable,2
i have a lot of hip scarfs i ordered the small medium i am not a tiny waited gal its a lot bigger than expected never had a small fit so large,1
we bought these for our children and the best men and women and they were exactly what we needed for our wedding they fit a variety of ages from 1078 years old excellent choice,2
just smaller than expected,2
it shows a little the bottom whenever it been down but thank you though i had to cover it up put some tight spandex on it,1
dont fit right,0
i bought theses because after working 1213 hour shifts as a nurse my legs ache i bought the blue ones in size 810 they are sooooo long i am 55 and wear an 85 shoe these socks go way up past my knees and are too tight to roll them down if they were right under the knee as the picture portrays they would be perfect,1
looks nice be nice if the size was adjustable so be careful of the size of your wrist,2
cheaply made but they do the job youll just look ridiculous,2
love the color but the quality is not very good at all fit is off somewhat would not buy again,0
i think i am going to have to put some stretchers in the toe area,1
larger than expected,1
size too small,0
i like how nice looking this purse is and that all the zippers open and close well it has enough pockets to fit plenty of small items this purse is medium size and looks stylish the material feels and looks like good quality material it is a very nice in person,2
i bought this because i was moving every time i folded it jewelry would come out had to put carefully in a separate bag just in case my jewelry came out,0
this is definitely woman swimshorts there is a reason the size 3234 marked as xl it has no recess for the genitalia it is uncomfortable and looks terrible it must be stoped from targeting to men,0
this was a gift,2
the material on this one is strange and really absorbs orders both body and environmental and doesnt breath well,1
sirve mas de pijama no como vestido,0
i wish it was not one size for a woman i dont have small hands glove size 75 but still these gloves are about 2 inches longer than my largest finger and about 12 inch at the thumb they are very bulky also the velcro to take off and keep back the mitten part is too small and at wrong location for smaller hands,1
so its way short to be a dress unless you want to get arrested im 57 and my booty just barley hangs out but it makes an adorable top runs small ordered size up and still a touch tight,2
gift to grand daughter was perfect,2
not like the picture im just gonna use it to hang around the housebr i got a small and two more of me can fit in it,0
not sure why shoe strings are made so long now but thats my only porblem with this item otherwise they are just as pictured and nice and glitter,2
very flattering just like the photo great color khaki my new favorite shirt,2
the thermals was cut small i bought my size and it seem like 2 or 3 sizes too small waste of money,0
i use this for ghost hunting it hold all of my equipment so i dont need to make trips back to my equipment case it is very comfortable and well made highly recommended for any paranormal investigator out there,2
the tshirt fit great good quality material that you could not see thru my daughter loved it,2
very affordable and comfortable,1
unfortunately i thought the material looked cheap very wrinkled when i took it out of the bag would definitely require dry cleaning before wearingbr i ordered my normal size but the sleeves and the shoulders were too biglong,0
this jacket is super comfortable it is on the light weight sign but it is warm it is comfortable and its kind of a fun hybrid look,2
a little tight fit,1
loses over 4 minutes a day if you just want it to count bpm its fine,1
these are womens narrow toe order half sizeone size up lightweight and looks great will have to test out soon in rain and hikes,1
top heavy,1
these are sooooo small so tiny ordered my usual size medium and they were way too small barely fitting my extra small daughter waist was like 27 across on the medium this is not modal this is cheap cheap cheap polyester and super thin each pair had seam holes right out of the package very poorly made product avoid,0
way too big so i will need to alter them before wearing them i was hoping they would shrink when they came too big but the did not i am fully capable of altering them and easier for me to do that than return them,1
my sister my mom and myself are having a ball w these glasses they are so close to the ones my mom wore in the 1960s cant wait to have my nieces wear them and take more pics,2
too short and material is too thickbr i am 5 9 and these pants are too short by about 8 inches and the material is like winter clothing,0
they are my favorite most comfortable pair i ever owed they are more effective for when its not super cold but still cold very happy have bought more since,2
best luggage i have ever owned they have held up well to our adventurous international travel dragging them through the airport checked baggage horrors of rough handling hopping on and off trains and buses rolling them several blocks down sidewalks in search of our hotel they rolled relatively easy in any direction so glad i chose this set love it,2
55 220lbs and 40c i could not get past the look of this dress the ruffles on the sleeve look great on the model but on a plus size person like me it just looks weird and adds so much volume whiten i want to look slimmer the dress fit me ok but this would definitely fit an hourglass figure better not an apple like myself the dark red color isnt bad though,1
the pins are cute shipping was fast,2
it was cheaply made polyester ugly not worth the money,0
for a 2000 coat its okay,1
i got exactly what was pictured with know gimmicks or tricks good quality a little flat shaped not contoured to a face like some other sunglasses ive owned the mirrored lens is amazing it also came with a travel bag for them a microfiber cloth for cleaning and a mini screwdriver in case the hinges ever come loose for 15 id say i hit the jackpot it came with way more than 300 ray bans i love them,2
very comfortable true to fit i have had problems with the purple bra zipper going off track and coming open during wear the black one which i wear more often does not seem to have this problem,1
sent it back way too small not only that it had a horrible smell,1
very thin material im fairly thin but this made me look like a busted can of biscuits i donated it to good will,0
super comfortable love the color fits perfectly,2
love that it comes with both the clip and cash strap i personally love the cash strap more it slimlines the whole package just right i can fit my id debit medical insurance misc x3 and cash in the strap really well and fan through them just fine ive gotten compliments about it too surprisingly although telling them the name has been awkward as you can imagine with the pronunciation,2
this hat really holds its shape,2
uncomfortable,0
great looking solid protectionhowever it limits the distance for the signal to reach your jeep,1
i ordered a small and it slides up and down my arm a small should of fit perfectly but it does not make sure to go a size down,1
i got size small and they were huge the bottom layer fit like basketball shorts and they were just loose and baggy all overbr otherwise they seemed like theyd be pretty good for the price,1
a tad bit smaller than id hoped and def needs some ironing thank u,0
hang dry only i guess these socks shrunk 2 sizes smaller when i put it in the dryer bummer,1
nice hat but i think he likes the little goggled face too much he likes looking at it but not wearing it keeps taking it off to look at the face im guessing as he gets older it wont be as much of an issue,2
the earrings are nice but from the picture i thought they would be larger i should have checked the measurements i think theyre like inch and a half i was hoping for at least 2 12 inches or more i love wooden earrings and the bolder the better these are very light weight as to not weigh your ears down,1
it is not the same color as picture its very shiny and silky the fit is good,1
bought a different sperry model and they were constantly sliding off my heels these stay up perfectly,2
impossible to shorten with included tool no instructions except yhey may be here iin japaneese if you have a small wrisst plan on having a jewler adjust it,1
my husband loves these says they go far get stains off,2
i was happy with this purchase and would buy againand i did,2
buy a size up,1
this would have been a great headband but it is running really small i ended up giving it to somebody with a smaller head perhaps if it was made of a yarn with stretch it would have been better,0
difficult to open and close,0
this shirt arrived and even before i washed it i could see that the length cut is very short i will have to wear it tucked in i am only 54 if you are taller than me it will fit you like a cutoff shirt,1
wish this would of fit right i have big boobs so it just didnt work,1
great variety of colors including camo their easy to change and its made keeping fit a lot more fun,2
looks beautiful and sparkly on great gift for someone with larger wrists,2
clip on that font lol like it comfortable and good color,2
was waiting for the cold weather to wear these they are perfect no arch support but still padded and very comfortable i think my feet will create a natural arch since be foot bed is so conforming,2
silver playing or coloring wore of after a few days but for the price its decent,1
the first one i got was a nice purple color but not right size reordered and received but color was not same purple color a little disappointed,1
it is horrible quality was broken when i got it,0
unfortunatley i didnt read all reviews before purchasing gloves the gloves are meant for bicycling not motorcycling the gloves are almost paper thin if you go down wearing these at more than 2530 mph they wont hold up not a happy customerbuyer beware,0
first be aware that like all these items made in asia that includes the patterns they are made from the fit is slightly off for the western woman arms are a bit tight compared to the larger sizes and the measurements are always offnever as long as stated or as wide thats just the way it is they keep thinking the petite stature of asian women which is totally not the western female standard i bought this my usual size and it fits but absolutely not oversized arms were tight as i expected but i can stretch them a bit so it is comfy on the cardigan the buttonholes are not finished in any way just a small slit without finishing the edges super cheap construction and way overpriced its the graphics that make these and i love that so i am keeping it but i will finish off the buttonholes and probably buy a pullover if the price goes down,1
these always got stuck in my hair and were a pain to wear,0
i should have gotten two inflatable sleeping pillows and stuffed them in a body pillow pillow case instead of thisbr br yes my legsknees were separated but there was practically nothing to support my arms its basically a tiny blow up mattressbr br packs great though,1
super cute tee with the perfect stretch,0
very well made it will be better if does have the option to take the strap off and have molle compatibility,1
absolutely adorable dress perfect fit,2
my grand thinks these are amazing and deemed them best shoe ever,2
fits to size easy to sleep in when you rather not have covers,2
i gave it 2 because they got the colors right and the size isnt to far off but the fabric is horrible it doesnt lay well when you move the shirt doesnt move the fabric isnt soft but it is light weight i would not buy this shirt again but im not going to go through the hassle of returning it so save yourself the time and money and get something else,0
could have bought a better earring at the dollar store for a buck i was disappointed,1
i bought for the beach and it was very small so i sent back not what i expected would be good if you wanted to use for a small purse,0
i took this bag with me on the trip the sewing start to break apart we had to carried our thing by hand can not trust this product,0
good construction a little slippery in the shoes for my taste,1
super cute but runs very very small ordered a mens medium for my husband and it fits me a little too perfect im 51 and 120lbs,0
i am so tired of getting things from other countries and having their sizing chart be in accurate i chose according to united states standards and yet the garment is still too small its a shame too because the material feels really nice and it probably would have looked nice,0
only one side is carved and the edges are rough they look so cheap i cant even wear them,0
i wear a size 10p normally so i ordered the medium fits perfectly though i do normally wear at least a 2 inch heel so would be long with flats,2
i like the cost fit and feel of this shirt but the first time thru the wash and dry the collar curled up and will not lie flat without ironing i know i am lazy but i have many other shirts that do not require ironing and i suppose i have become used to living in the space age where permanent press means it is permanently pressedironed i know there are collar straightening tabs but they typically assume the collar is designed with a slot for them and again if those were needed they should have been provided as part of the shirt so although i like the shirt overall i am a bit disappointed that i have to pull out an ironing board again like we did in the previous century,1
looked nothing like the picture had to return,0
wore this for a summer wedding and got several compliments fit was expected but the sash was rather flimsy would also be good for a cocktail hour type of situation,1
nice stretch,2
the overall quality of the piercings were great however the angle of the bend makes it very easy for it to fall out very difficult to bend more,1
this hat is huge i can usually tighten a hat enough to fit my head but i made this one as tight as it will go and its still ridiculously large ill have to find some really big guy who likes pink to give it to unless you have an unusually big head i would skip this one,1
wish it was larger great design,0
the case costs more than the shades too fragile,0
i guess for the price i paidthe quality reflects the product cheap,0
theyre ok but the one inch elastic band accentuates any rolls you might have the large was a little loose on me,1
it was a gift for my mom she loved it so much i sent her the earrings to match,2
fun dress for the right occasion,2
blu pepper tends to run more like juniors sizing than womens this was incredibly short and somewhat small it was too form fitting rather loose and flowy so i returned it,1
great relief for my feet will keep a pair of these forever,2
me agrado todo el diseño,2
im really torn with this product first it is not silk so the title is false advertising it is polyester and only one side feels smooth to the touch second the care instructions indicates the do not wash symbol not sure how you can never wash something you wear the colors and quality are great for polyester,1
might have to tailor the bottom of the pant legs not quite what i expected thought they kinda came in like harem pants but didntstill very cute nice and roomy,1
was so excited unwrapped put on held arm out to snap a pic and it literally broke and fell to the ground so bummed out,0
buy a size up runs small,1
got as a xmas gift for my exwife from my daughterbr br folds down pretty small easy enough to fit in a mid sized purse easily fits in a cars front door stash pocketsbr br appearance is good build seems to be good note that this is a fairly heavy umbrella enough so that planning to keep it in a small purse will add notable weight but on a potentially rainy day it is probably worth it but not something you are likely to leave in your purse all the timebr br the build quality seems good to withstand pretty decent windbr br spreadcoverage when opened is decent keeping in mind it is a ministowable umbrella there is not a lot of drop from the top peak to the sides this means that in a windy rain you can expect to still be exposed to a fair amount of rainbr br obviously you are paying mostly for the name and a betterthancheap umbrella build quality but this is still just a chinese made product as almost all coach products are nowadays this is not the same coach quality that we all knew 1520 years ago,2
arrived on time correct size and great price,2
expected fleece lining to be thicker,1
material is flimsy,1
i would have liked these to be a little tighter i wear them under polo work shirts im 59 and 165 should have gone with a small otherwise theyre very comfortable,2
i bought these for my daughter as she turned 18 i suppose it is my own bad for not knowing how 5mm 34looks34 but these turned out to be kind of unimpressive they are pretty and all but too small to be very 34wowful34 like i wanted them to be if i had it to do over i would have gotten bigger rubies,1
they are cute and good quality but they are very hard to open,1
these are great boots i wear then all day at work and longer with zero problems very comfortable i initially bought them in black and loved them so much i bought them in brownbr br the only shoe ive found more comfortable is merrell but they dont have as many styles that look good in the officebr br a followup i found that the shine on the backs of the heels wore off quite quickly i think this is from driving i have a manual transmission and have to use both feet hence there is wear on both booties the boots still look great for workexcept for that i will have to figure out how i can repair the damage perhaps by polishing,2
arm holes are a bit gapey but looked fine regardless,1
the white part of the shirt is sewn on the jacket so it only looks like a combo when its just 1 super thin long sleeve shirt isnt flattering in person,0
the sewing really is of poor quality both pockets have totally torn the stitching and i never had anything in the pockets ordinarily i would have sent it back but i really like the style so i sewed it up myself buyer beware though the stitching quality is poorbr br edit seam under armpit is now torn still like this but sewing is crap,1
the print is beautiful however the material and quality of the actual pants are not great,0
beautyful sunglasses good quality hevy material love it,2
save your money battery that came inside of the boogie bomb had exploded inside causing damage i bought this for my 9yr olds birthday needless to say he was very disappointed and i am very upset,0
i have received both my first and second paid of compression foot sleeves the first ones seemed so promising for my foot pain i decided i better have a back up pair as well i developed plantar fasciitis after wearing too many flip flops over summer no i didnt heed the warnings i had a great deal of pain and decided based upon reviews given to try the sleeves i am cautiously optimistic as after wearing them for only about a week i have already noticed some improvement i am no longer in excruciating pain when i stand or walk i know there is a long way to go however i feel the sleeves are definitely having some impact and i hope to continue to improve,2
i ordered 3 sizes larger just to be sure i could have possible gone with 2 sizes larger it was a little big in the chest midriff so i washed it and it shrank to just the right size i am only 5 and i wanted it just below the knee so i had to hem it about 2 inchesbr i purchased this dress for and 1940s dance it was perfect i got several favorable comments on my choice,2
love them used them for sn evening event,2
it is very see through and cheaply made and do not like it at all,0
seems well constructed a bit of whimsy in a serious situation suits my lifestyle and image will likely use it in cold weather for deer season purchased both available color options would like to see in a cami and blaze orange too,2
this is definitely a fake bag the letters should not connect and it does not have the metal on the bottom of the bag as shown it is a nice bag but you can get the real thing on the designers website for around the same price,0
i have worn skechers for yearsathletic casual and sandals i have never had an issue until this pair almost no support and very squishyflimsy feel it shifted on my foot with every step,0
the headband itself was a beautiful turquoise color it is also very well made the problem for me is i have very fine hair and normally have issues with head bands slipping off i was excited that this head band ran smaller than other ones that i have had my hope was that it would fit the material itself was very slick so the band woulld not stay on my head unfortunatly i had to return it,1
awesome pin,2
nice earrings wish they made them bigger hoops,0
love the band and made my ftbit more comfortable fitting better,2
these are really cute but more for people w multiple piercings to stack way too small if you only want them for one piercing it looks laughable alone thats how small they are,1
this wallet is super cute came in on time and i got everything transferred over from my old and much smaller wallet to this new one i was so happy with it until i tried zipping it up with everything in it the zipper is so cheaply made that it will zip up fine on its own but once you add things like cash cards and change the zipper will pull apart very disappointed and sending back,1
the label on the package said the correct info for what i ordered but the badge holder was only 3 diameter just returned it via a ups store,1
the magnetic jewelry extenders are great the photo shows 4 gold and 4 silver i received 2 of each im waiting for a reply to my claim,0
there okay they look nice on,1
too big again,0
poorly made terrible fitting dress the only thing i liked about it was the ombre green to blue colors,0
these are advertised as being wide in the toe box for a more natural toe splay however i found them about average width to narrow keen merrill and blundstone are all wider in the toe box than these,1
it fits nice,1
while i like the look design and the somewhat close fit fine what bothers me is all the extra threads on the inside of each sock those with rough feet or nails that catch will find it hard to put these on id prefer less pattern and more ease in a sock made for long wear,1
absolutely love these sunglasses fit color and style are perfect,2
the outfit fit but it just isnt as long as i would have liked it do you have anything longer in length,1
i will pin the front as the slit in the front is much wider than shown im hopeful i can make it work as it is a comfortable material and pretty,1
not worth the money to matter how inexpensive they are they literally turned me green within2hours of wearing them and im not that sensitive to the fake metal plating i just wasted my couple dollars and i still cant wear my necklace i got these for,0
been using asics for walking every day for years love them,2
it was a little hard to put on but when it was on it fit great and was a tad bit longer than i had expected it hit about midriff and im 53 which is exactly what i was hoping for,2
i travel a lot i would recommend this for everyone it is extremely compact and convenient and it helps to know ahead of time what your luggage weighs as to avoid switching and swapping items from bag to bag andor paying extra fees for overweight luggage not to mention holding up the line,2
i saw this inc international concepts sweater on sale for 11 thought it was too good to be true it was this sweater is really cheap quality it arrived already pilled i laundered it per label instructions and the pilling got worse its headed for the thrift store pile,0
its too tight across the shoulders for me puts pressure on the chest,1
i bought this dress for a funeral she loved pink so this fit in perfect i wish it would of been a couple of inches longer because i am 510 but overall i love it,2
material was far thinner on the vivid lilac and wrinkled easily,0
nice sandals and attractive however they run small and are very narrow order a half size larger and wide if they offer that they are comfortable with supportive sole just too small and narrow,1
i bought this as part of a 70s costume and its super cute but it kept turning on my neck now you cant tell in my pics and it just looks like a leather choker buy it was a little annoying i really cant say why it kept shifting but it did maybe it needed to be tighter but i wasnt willing to literally choke myself very very cute though good price and nicely made,1
the owl is gorgeous which is why i bought this the chain looks pretty but the gold color started fading to black within one week i understand that it is not intended to be real gold but the chains quality is poor,1
this is a very clunky band and the buckle is very large compared to the strap i have a decent sized wrist but it was out of proportion compared to the strap also the leather was somewhat thick and did not bend easily around my write which was unpleasant i wore it a few time and then bought a different leather band,0
this is really bad sorry small is listed as having a 275 waist it actually measures 24 inches burgundy is gathered at waist and not flat shown in photo buttons do not align correctly and it is a tulip cut at bottom very misrepresented,0
i like some of the aspects of this jewelry box but im not happy with some of it too its a nice quality well made however there 8 little square compartments that are too deep to be practical i have to stand directly over this to even see down into those little divided compartments nothing really fits into them either there is way too much space for rings but not nearly enough space for earrings for as well made as the outside is the inside of the lid is just not great for necklaces i like that you can hang delicate necklaces there but the little pegs are cheap and flimsy and wont last long there is really no space for me to store my watches if you have mainly rings and necklaces this might work for you not for many earrings watches or bracelets,1
my emotions are mixed on this one first the burgundy isnt remotely as dark as in the picture that really bummed me out its more medium red still very pretty but not what i intended on purchasing when shown a deep wine color second it fits huge which i knew from reviews im normally a us size 10 and bottom heavy so i offered a small i need like an xxs but i think i can make it work the neckline has elastic so it can be worn on shoulders or hanging off and i like that a lot overall i plan to keep it maybe ill try again with an xs and black haha,1
very cheap material they broke after wearing 2 times as if they were panties hose do not buy them nice aspect but that is all,0
the kneelength is nice and color is as advertised fabric is soft but a little clingy id have to size up for the bust area not to look like a tight bandage petite and smallbusted girls and pearshaped women would look so nice in this dress,1
bought these for my daughter and she is very happy with the look feel and warmth,2
jewelry was cute brought it for a photo shoot but they all broke within a hour of me wearing it,0
gorgeous i love them you can wear them anywhere,2
too costumie,0
looks like a plain gray scarf green color is very faint,0
i gave a 4 because i havent washed the material yet but if it fades ill let you all know very soft material i wear a 2x but i bought a 3x because of the legs i have definitely a 2x would have been too tight it sits on my body shows up my figure light weight wanted a wine color took burgundy trust me you would not know the difference between wine and burgundy definitely would get another if i would get a discount just saying but go get 1 and tell me what u think thumbs up,2
the buckle came in gold instead of black as shown it is a low cost item the gold highlights that even more,0
the robe is a perfect springsummer weight robe the fit is great after being washed and dried in the drierim 54 130 for the price the robe is of good quality pretty color pink perfect for around the house id purchase it again,2
i found them to tight for comfort around my knee,0
these basic leggings fit well and give a nice sleek line however the fabric was thinner than i was expecting even though it says thin in the description i would recommend these for warmer weather but not in the winter,1
i gave it to my daughter,1
i really like how this looks under some black tank tops the crisscross patterns fit nicely and rest in all the right places the bra part itself fit a little snug like a sports bra it wasnt as thin as a sleep bra but was the same thickness as a medium weight sports bra with some padding i dont necessarily like the way it looks under my shirt as much as a nice supportive bra so i tried to put a regular bra on top which made it a little more tightawkward the overall look is nice though and i get a lot of compliments so i still wear it,2
really cute very soft fabric not too thick and not too thin isnt too fitted but with the belt adds some shape to the body of the tunicdress i am wearing with leggings i love the asymmetrical hem and the button detailing for reference im 135 and 5 hits above the knee on me,2
nice sunglasses and very stylish but they do not have enough april g loaded arms,1
decent formfactor works fairly well but the value proposition is ridiculous worth maybe 13 of what they charge,1
dislike design,0
the quality is not that good,1
it was a pretty necklace that i wouldve loved to wear but it came broken,0
daughter wears a size 6 or 6x i ordered a 120 and it fits perfectly,2
nice shirt should have been oops has a snag right out of the bag other than will only be good for maybe 3 washes nice looking shirt,1
omg buy these now they are smooth and soft and not seethrough at all they are highwaisted tummy control but not tight and compressing they are perfect for summertime i already bought more,2
nice shoe for suits,2
bought these for my 11 year old daughterfit well when tried onthen washed once and they literally shrunk to half their size or smaller,0
i bought a small and it was large i have to fix it the fabric is not good either,0
i was hoping to gift ordered a size ten but just now saw that it has the 41 on the bottom of the shoes which seems to convert to a size 105 this is too large for my intended giftee however they appear to be quite nice other than the size difference,2
i ordered the light grey color you are able to seethrough the top fit of the top is great i just wish it was a thicker material,1
cute durable but rather simple materials i wanted it to make it less obvious that i was an american tourist and this helped the effort i like that it doesnt say 34passport34 really big on it this survived a few weeks of being shuffled in handbags money belts backpacks and the like with no signs of wear i did store a couple little ticket stubs and such inside and it didnt stretch or anything,2
it fits as expected its very comfy and stylish looks good with and without hair,2
this dress runs about 2 sizes too small order much a much larger size than you actually take,0
thit is good to have to play with snow if there is no other choice but it doesnt keep warm the color seems to fade out a bit after a while not recommend,0
the wonderfully soft flowing jersey material makes this top both comfortable and flattering the fit was perfect for me but perhaps something to consider if you dont want a clingy top i typically wear a large in juniors and a medium in misses erring on the side of caution i ordered a large in this top it fits perfectly but it is very form fitting up to the bottom of the ribcage on me i have a long torso then flares out over the abdomen and parts south very nicely the sleeves are long and very fitted but not too tight the material is nice and stretchy so this top will accomodate a variety of body types given the nature of the material and how the top part is formfitting i would suggest sizing up if youre doubtful i definitely recommend this top and expect to purchase it in other colors it looks especially fetcing with leggings or a pencil skirt,2
i was dismayed to find my hands dyed a bright pink after first using the gloves planting flowers i had to scrub my hands with grandulated oxyclean i tried to remove the dye from the gloves with a waterbleach soak but after drying the gloves and using them once more the dye oozed again to the trash they went life is too short to deal with such a bother the company must remedy this dye issue,0
the fabric is a wonderful cotton amazing pattern with complimentary colors i wear size 18 or 20 i ordered 26 i like room i think a size 24 would work i work i elementary school and color works the school colors are tie dye this is perfect dress in so many ways one of the teachers is a seamstress and she was mesmerized by the fabric i am thinking about ordering another dress and asking for pockets i am 5434 and the dress comes to my angles again perfect thank you lakkar haveli,2
cute but didnt say it has a clip on which squeezes the crap out of my ears too bad really cute,1
i ordered my wife what i thought was her dream dress for our anual seabee ballmilitary ball i paid for overnight shipping to ensure it got here on time when it arrived my wife opened the box and to her horror it was ripped on the front and someone had duct taped the rip closed on the back of the tear there is a shoe print on it as well it looks and smells like someone had worn it and sent it back sequins were messed up now its two days before the ball and there is no time to get her a new one thank you gk queen for ruining the one night we really get to spend together as we have kids and cant afford babysitters all of the time you ruined supposed to be a very special evening for us with this i dont even know what to call it,0
i can always count on brinley to have my width for boots and they are in styles i like,2
sizing is not true to size runs at least a full size smaller gave mine away instead of returning or reordering it is beautiful though just not true to size,1
the toe box is tight but the rest f the show fits as expected i had to leave them unzipped or take the liners out to wear them which made the heel looser than id like i miss the days when shoes would stretch these have not yet they do look good though,1
disappointed that the fabric is not the same for all dresses some have a shiny finish and some have a dull finish,1
my artist loves it,2
very cute dress but the sleeves were incredibly tight like ridiculously tight the hoop skirt was great gave the dress good volume i didnt have an issue with movement or sitting in the dress only issue was the newborn size sleeves,1
i loved the belly ring it was just as beautiful in the picture when i received it but only after wearing it for a few months the rose fell off of the eiffel tower and then the tower part snapped of as well cute product but cheap quality,1
i dislike that they are peeling and color is fading ooff turning white i thought these were real crocs they cost the same as the real ones,0
i received the shirt i was going to give it to my sister for her birthday but unfortunately the right sleeve is sewn together and you cant put your arm through it i was so embarrassed i had nothing to give her for her birthday i would like a replacement or a refund please,0
the butt is super saggy and way too large goes all the way up my entire back and i got size small fits like a large or xl,0
fit great and look great,2
nothing about these matters in light of the fact that their size 910 is actually a size 8 if that they are incredibly small and i did double check to be sure they sent the right size they are simply terribly small and unusable for anyone above a size 8 the person using this pair is a size seven an actual 7 so these get one star because they are wholly unusable its not a matter of a slight sizing error they are sized completely wrong and to such a degree that i wouldnt trust the brand to be consistent in sizing errors i cant recommend sizing up because i cant tell you how much larger to go given how bad these are good luck in your search,0
disliked them because they were very thin n runs very small if u take a 7 order a lager size im a 7 n they r tight n shrink,1
i have been wearing this inexpensive toe ring for the last 4 months non stop including a one month trip to thailand it is still in great shape and is very comfortable i wear steel toed boots to work every day and i can never feel this toe ring on me i love it,2
i love the look of the product however it carries a strong chemical smell that i cannot get rid of,1
it is lightweight enough that im not sweating during church but warm enough that i can wear it outside during the winter i love the length pockets and print i will be buying another one soon,2
run small,1
looks good just too small,1
very well made soft and comfortable pants bought for wifeshe says im a buxom 35 waist and 51 hips the pants for my hips gently but not tight very comfortable waist too,1
bought to wear on cruise received a number of compliments on it after reading the other reviews i bought a size larger and it fit perfect do not hesitate to buy you will not regret your purchase,2
these flops looked very pretty however the insole is like high grit sandpaper they were rough on my feet when i walked around the room needless to say i returned them amazon is great about returns no problem ever we order a lot of stuff,1
great quality sturdy exactly what i needed love it that they come with the little jewelry envelopes too makes for a very professional looking package,2
they didnt hold up for running very well but survived a 10k which was all i needed,1
love the mk logo font print and color the stitching would rather have it be dark than white though,1
i like the look and feel of my pants however they fit too small i have order xxxl,2
based on the price i didnt expect it to be as attractive as it is i was very pleased would highly recommend it,2
always get lots of complements when i wear these unless its my james bond persona,2
i got it today and im wearing it now i love the the style and i get a lot of compliments this is the second one of this style i have own,2
i wanted these for support when walking around the house because we leave our other shoes at the door and these are very supportive and just what this physical therapist was looking for,2
loved the colors on this purse which is why i ordered but its quite a bit larger than i like this causes me to load it down with 34stuff34 making it heavy then items im looking for get lost would be nice if it had more compartments to organize contents cell phone compartment isnt large enough for my samsung galaxy 8 it falls out every time i try it has only one zippered compartment on inside and 2 small pockets that arent deep enough to hold hardly anything,1
this top fit well but the material is a cheap jersey would not recommend,0
sunglasses are a beautiful color and i love tifosi but these were just too big for my face,0
its a bit fitted but all in right placesbr not suitable for the well hung,1
from the colr description and picture i thought they were black they are definately gray,1
very pretty when it arrived just the right length and size about the size of a 50 cent piece if youve ever see one of those plan to order more of the different colors,2
used it for a halloween costume for my 11 year old son and it worked perfectly,2
these bows are super cute and exactly as pictured but the band left a mark on my newborns head she was only 7 lbs so i wasnt expecting them to be too tight kind of disappointing since they are so cute and i expected them to last for a while,0
these were advertised as womens tights leggings theyd be tight on skinny grammar school children ordered medium my wifes only 5 2 not very heavy,0
i went 1 size up and was still too snug to be comfortable,1
super thin material super short nothing like pictures,0
the material feels a bit thin but they dont look cheapthin on i normally wear a womans large and had no problem with the fit and they dont roll or bunch upbr they are not the most functional if youre looking to keep your hands warm shocker i know right br br these gloves are a punky and quirky but they arent too 34tough34 to be styled as feminine edgy if that is more your thing,2
excellent very comfortable pjs,2
broke the first time i used it very disappointed,0
love the color,2
as soon as i put this on i felt like i was 220 lbs of twisted steel and sex appeal a bald eagle landed on my shoulder and screeched as i draped in the american flag looked into the abyss of the pacific ocean whilst holding a pbr with my aviators on,2
looks cool but a couple issues bad fit realized after the fact that washing an apron with leather straps is probably not going to hold up looks cool though,0
i really like this jacketbr br fit is right on definitely waterrepellentbr br problem is the thread is cheap its literally falling apart due to thread breakage i question any hard use especially if you need to depend on it,1
im 52 and 112 pounds and as much as i wanted it to fit it was just too loose the hubby took a look and said uh uh while shaking his head vigorously back and forth unfortunate its too cute,0
i got this dress thinking i might wear it for valentines day it was somewhat of a disappointmentbr br prosbr br the crisscross feature at the top is great it allows you to wear a regular bra while still having a cute offshoulder feature and very attractive drapingbr br the color is pretty and vibrantbr br consbr br the dress has no lining this means that it is fairly flimsy and doesnt have the weight and drape to it that would make it look like an expensive dressbr br its made out of a thin polyester its not so thin that you can see through it but it doesnt flow over the body and anywhere that you dont totally fill it out it hangs sort of weirdly its not a dress that makes me feel confident to go out on a date,1
poor quality poor fit nothing what i expected would not recommend would not even give a 1 star,0
hugh comfortable out of shower unattractive due to size but they work inexpensive would not buy again,1
nice cheap shorts thats comfortable stitching is starting to come out near the bottom of the leg seams i would recommend buying a size up or 2 depending on how baggy you like would i buy again prolly not but you get what you pay for,1
the material used in this shirt wrinkles very easily i wouldnt purchase it again,0
i ordered a size up and its perfect,2
great fabrics and very comrortable one major problem is no fly opening it makes bathroom calls difficult,0
label poorly stitched,0
was just as described,2
the colors are nice it fits well and is cooler than others i have tried but they are very fragile after wearing them 3 times they were fraying and tore,1
im an 1820 and its a bit snug at the back at shoulder blades but otherwise i love to layer with this jacket the quality lining leaves a bit to be desired but yet again it gives me the look i expected i wouldnt say its worth the asking price now that i have it but nonetheless its fashionable,1
really bad quality,0
ordered this dress for a concert and it fit just beautifully i love the lightweight material and for the price it was very elegant i would definitely purchase again it was true to fit and i actually could have ordered a size lower and it would have worked just fine love this dress,2
finally a flip flop with a good arch support this is my second pair of vionic thongs they are well made and last years fit true to size,2
love them,2
i thought these would be similar to my classic black and white cloadfoam adidas but these are less comfortable,1
soft but awful if your short,0
these shoes look sharp my son picked these out for the school year unfortunately theyve only been worn to school for 14 days and the toes are already losing their color had i known they would wear so quickly cosmetically we would have purchased something else other than that we have no complaints and hell continue wearing these,1
these are very pretty but are thin the filters are not enough it should be a little thicker,1
classic levis 501s shrink to fit i guess they havent shrunk enough yet because they are still baggy a couple of times in hot water and a hot dryer should do the trick they still feel great the fabric might be a skosh thinner but they are still rugged 501s i will buy again,2
excellent quality,2
the shoes is ok but the quality of the product does not give me the expectation i am looking for on the price is that is asking me to pay for the sewing on the pattern of the shoes is sticking out which gives it a cheap quality makebr br an okay product but i wont recommend this to anyone if you are looking for a quality shoes in a good price,1
cheap and doesnt hold the shape at all,0
looks great fits ok on my 2004 rubicon bullet point came off second day driving but goes right back on i could glue it but its not a big deal if you want something sturdy i wouldnt recommend it,0
i love how its a hoodie and tank top in onebr i like the hoodie vest how its medium to light weight material wear,2
i thought i ordered the correct size medium after reading reviews and the size chart but it was too tiny i am 54 and 140 lbs and 36c and medium was way too tight for the slightly baggy look pictured i would likely need an xl customer service was good and it was a cute top,1
the lights in one of the shoes stopped working 2 days after the 30 day grace period but only the 2nd time wearing them bc they were purchased for school so they werent worn for a couple of weeks after purchase no way to exchange item that isnt working,0
ok panties but no stretch so it makes them confining not my favorites,1
it was too tight on my head and i have an average sized head cant wear it without getting a headache the part in the listing about it having spf is a lie nothing on the package about it and the skull pattern didnt match up on the invisible seam very disappointed,0
really good product but bad seller took 3 weeks to get before and after on leather sofa i used a good leather cleaner and a good leather conditioner before i feathered on the paint remember its easier to add color but difficult to remove too much,1
if anyone ever tells you not to buy a reversible kimono off of amazon they dont know what living life is all about,2
ok not really what i expected but guess buying sunglasses online isnt easy so,0
the quality of the wrists band could have been better,1
i love my new clarke sandals they are so comfortable they give me support with comfort i used to wear my old ones around the house i wear these everywhere,2
love this hat and it provides uv protection in the hot sun,2
strap looks great with my seiko 5 snk809 stitching appears to be high quality the 18mm width strap is fine for small to medium wrists up to 75 but will probably be too short for larger wrists dont know about wider straps with bigger watches for this brand very happy with my purchase,2
larger than anticipated,1
the socks fit my wife who wears a size 8 shoe they stayed put in her shoes thanks to the elastic cuff which she didnt find uncomfortable they got somewhat pilly in the wash but still fit the washing instructions are confusing on the product page it says machine wash in cold water and air dry on the product label its wash with warm water do not bleach tumble dry with low heat,1
took the advice of other reviews and will take the side stays out they are uncomfortable and not needed the way the bra is designed the stays are too long and really poke into the ribs when you sit down too bad maidenform doesnt read some true review and modify their garments,1
if it says expected but it shrinks really easily do not put in dryer,1
maybe just my personal body chemistry but my shin and even cloths are stain black from oxidation otherwise looks great but i cant enjoy it during the summer,1
fit is so awkward and the belt is cheap into the donation box it goes,1
the goodthe sweater is super soft and cutebr the badthere is no way the xl that i received is actually an adult sized xlbr what i received is possibly a child sized sweater in a plastic bag marked xlbr the actual sweater does not have any size indicatorsbr the neck opening is 3 inches,0
overall satisfied but runs way big i have broader shoulders and thicker arms from my past life as a gymnast and a large was too large i wish i would have exchanged it in time to switch it out for a medium at least,1
the top part of the dress is too loose and looked weird even with a slip otherwise a really pretty dress,0
the color and cut of this dress are great i just wish it were made of cotton or something more breathable purchased it for a vacation in hawaii so it would have been nice if the fabric had been a little cooler overall it was fine for the short length of time it was worn,2
my daughter loved them,2
this top is a little wide across the chest and the arm holes are big the material isnt very stretchy and it is pretty thin it shows every bump and lump,1
returned,0
so cutegreat timing to wear for partysadly one of the bells was missing,0
too tight at the neck,1
bought an xl for size 13 shoes per the size guidelines on the allen edmonds site way too small,0
the embroidered air assault badge is incorrect and looks like a helicopter with a large black mouth in the middle not the same as the air assault badge,0
the ring broke after only wearing it for a few hours otherwise i like it,0
cheap we may save your money,0
decent shirts but not the best quality theyre extremely thin,1
i got a black pair like this from the same brand and they fit perfectly so i wanted to get brown as well they fit completely different same style same size and the brown pair is way too big in my waisthips pretty disappointing,1
i like the shirt and the way it fits however the design on the front is an iron on slab of paint that will bubble and start flaking in the first two washes,1
was not satisfied with this purchase when i received it short logo of yugioh was discolored and looked very cheaply made,0
very comfortable and great arch support,2
fits tight with no stretch must be small chested to wear pants fit fine,1
not very flattering for those with a large bottom but they are comfortable enough to wear all day,1
fit as expected convenient pocket inside to store house key or debit card,2
says its for plus size but the breast support is non existent and the cups on the bigger size barely covers anything fabric with design is also completely see through and not nearly as long as photo shows bottoms fit great,0
so soft and comfy you put in you got and it shapes right to it i love these now i want the red ones i need back surgery and this looks good for recovery,2
i can not wear this sweater as it is very itchy,0
well the zipper broke after two weeks making the entire purchase a waste of money what else can i say the socks themselves seemed to be of decent quality which is nice for pocket socks which usually are of subpar quality but if the zipper breaks and all of your money falls out then its quite expensive it would be nice if the pockets were just the bare minimum size to accomodate one or two cards as i like to keep 34 cards plus cash in it and it is a very tight fit and difficult to remove money or anything because the pockets are so small so even if the zipper hadnt broken i would much prefer a larger sized pocket for actual practical everyday use,0
broke after a month,0
not good looks better on the site until you have the product very disappointed,0
not for summer,0
i really like the size and the insert that allows the bags to sit upright my only disappointment is that the loops that attach the bags to the registers all broke off the very first time i tried to use them i mean every last one of them i told myself i was going to save them and sew them on properly but i never got around to it so i now get the stinkeye from sales clerks however the bag handles and seams seem to be holding up fine so farbr br update now the seams of three of the bags have failed luckily i noticed before i was scrambling around the grocery parking lot,1
super beautiful earrings but theyre also really easy to bend out of curiosity i slightly bent the back of the earring to see how solid it was and was surprised how easy it was to bend i was able to bend it back into shape but will have to be very careful so that they dont get misshapen,1
i really liked them a lot when the sun hits me head on i can continue driving and it does not dazzle me,2
not for me,0
cute dress i ordered two dresses and returned one both dresses had a issue with the button one was falling off the other the button came off when i opened it it was being held on by one little string,1
it was just too small made it impossible to use,0
its a cute shirt but the arms were too small for me so i am returning it,1
bought these for my better half he has had reconstruction on his foot due to an on the job heel injury that foot is very distorted but these slippers are flexible enough to enable him to slip his foot in he finds them very comfortable,2
i ended up returning them was not what i thought,0
i have to saya little dissapointed with this outfit jacket wasnt finished well and the pants are very small and tight,0
like the cloth colour is great just like in the picture,1
i have returned it,0
pin head bent today during first use removing bracelet from marathon gsar,0
these are really light almost clear with a hint of pink i was expecting a little more color,1
i love these sock they support my lega i wear all the time,2
colors were very vibrant the material for the bottoms kept slipping down i returned it,1
the neckline is boat neck bra straps are always showing,2
all right in the colors and all just the size cart was wronga small was 3032i might try to get a medium see if it will fit better,2
i usually love nike sports bras but this one was a little disappointing for me it runs a little big and the removable pad is one large pad with a big opening across the top having one pad instead of two and having such a big slit for it made the bra sit awkwardly on my chestbr it probably wouldve been comfortable but the fit just wasnt right for me,1
the material is very nylonfeeling so your pants fall off them unless you have a good belt the fit is way too snug especially the larger size other than that they are pretty comfortable one star fit the legs well 2nd star and dont come apart at the seams with heavy stretching 3rd star,1
love to wear them,2
please with the product and fits perfectly,2
i have really mixed reviews about this one i was looking for comfy isolating at home wear i was looking for soft cotton the listing said cotton the tag says cotton there is no way this is cotton it has serious stretch in it like spandex and its shinyslick smooth like a workout performance shirt it fits loose at the neck but not awful its totally fine for hanging out in my house and the backyard but i wouldnt wear it out and its not comfortable enough to sleep in the price was fine for what it is thats the only reason it didnt go back,1
just what i was looking for,2
i wanted to love this dress the print was nice and it seemed casual but classy but sadly it was way to sheer see through itd be good as a beach wrap for reference i ordered the dress in white,1
purse is much larger and more structured than expected,1
way to wide especially in the heal,0
a little thinner than i expected but its holding up just fine,1
perfect for a growing kid bought a second pair cause we loved them,2
this was very small i ended up gifting it to my 10 year old niece because i couldnt wear it at least shes happy haha,1
fits like a sack did not come in the color i wanted would not recommend,0
love this shirt its very soft i have another version of this shirt thats blue and orange troy lee never dissapoioints,2
she didnt like the way it fit,0
super cute daughter loved it,1
way to small and tight very uncomfortable might be good for a 3yr old,0
this wallet is so pretty and soft i really like it and it holds quite a bit i had to take it out of my smaller purse though because it was too tight ill still use it with roomier purses,2
i like the variety of beads one broke immediately which makes me weary of the others also im fairly slim so they are a little larger than i would normally want but they are okay,1
just took it out of the package and it already has a bad zipper on it was hoping being a little more expensive meant a little better quality apparently not,0
very comfortable and affordable,2
this shirt is so soft and comfortable washes up nicely and letters look readable and big,2
shirt is huge,1
this watchband is perfect for my mickey mouse watch that is only gold in color now that it is winterish where i live this band is not sweaty to me im ready for our snow,2
very comfortable fit with very soft material,2
so hard playing golf without it i love how it protects my arms and keeps me cool,2
gloves very good and i will keep them but i though i had ordered plain leather glove with no cloth but i like them just the same mr emond,2
this shirt is shiny and feels like its made of vinyl it was very hot and uncomfortable i have other shirts that cost a similar amount that are much nicer the fit was also a bit small i would recommend this shirt only in an emergency,0
i was hoping this skirt was a real high waist style that i can wear to an event but the material and style was just averagebr it was very thin maybe for the summer as a casual skirt but the photo gave the impression it was a more dressy,0
was a little small,0
4 of my rings were broken and one got stuck in my nose not worth it,0
i had to return them they run small,1
i bought this backpack for a simple 3 day trip one strap popped odd before we even left there is other areas where it seems to be tearing at the seam it sits pretty low but i also could have adjusted the straps better there is also a hole in the fabric in the pocket at the top however overall its pretty ok it manged to carry about 50lbs of weight it could have more straps and stronger material,1
my first time to ever order leggings online and i was very happy when i got them they are so soft and smooth and i saved at least 3 by ordering these instead of this pair from a boutique i shop with i am 56 and weigh around 200 i also currently 23 weeks pregnant and they come up over my belly they do feel a bit tighter around my legs than i would normally expect so im hoping they just need a little 34breaking in34 only giving 4 stars for now as i have only tried them on once since receiving them,2
love the gizeh style birks the pink sole and button are great accents the w width in birks is a regular width not wide which i knew and they fit great,2
love it,2
because this skirt looked short i decided to get a larger size so it could sit on my hips and not be too curve hugginghoochy looking i am 5834 150 lbs and usually wear 2930 or medium in paige products unless its a really skinny jean like verdugo and i own about 30 pairs of paige denim pieces including jeans leather pantes overalls and a jumpsuit the large in this skirt was so skintight i had to step on the scale to see if i had gained weight overnight i hadnt the material is good quality though and the style very cute but sadly it will be going back,1
a again i like these sandals but they were too narrow for my feet i hope to return them for a credit thank you,0
i bought leopard print with leaves shirt is made from good fabric it wont shrink when washed so dont order a size up to account for shrinking the color is very different than the picture because of that i returned it i can pull off mustard yellow but not orange,1
feels cheap,1
beautiful comfortable shoesbr got camel color and perfect for fallbr i normally wear size 75 or 8 and got 75br i think these are true to sizebr very well made for the price,2
love this dress not only is it pretty but super comfortable as well received lots of compliments on it and they couldnt believe the price i paid for it wore mine with cowboy boots but the dress also looks nice with a heel or wedge sandal i liked it so much i ordered another love that it has pockets too,2
great product they were to wide in the legs for me i ordered the same brand but different model,2
these are really thin material and very cheap quality feeling i dont think they would last very long before falling apart gonna return them,0
my grandson weighs 78 lbs and is 4ft 7br i purchased a youth smallbr from underarm to underarm across the chest this jersey measures 18br the length of the sleeve from the shoulder to wrist is 19 inchesbr this shirt will fit perfectly over my grandsons hockey chest protector and shoulder padsbr i know he will have it for years because the quality is tremendous which is great because as he grows hell be able to wear it as a regular shirtbr definitely size down if your child is not wearing this over hockey equipmentbr dont hesitate to buy this jersey it is very reasonably priced especially for the amazing qualitybr br,2
not plus size ar all,0
thie product looks great on the model but for those of us who need some help looking a little slimmer and less blocky well this doesnt work so well i found the wires to be in the wrong place too low and digging in the removeable cups were all over the place really why would anyone remove the cups and the inner bra was not supportive enough i got some tummy control but the way my body filled it i looked like a block instead of showing off a little bum bottom seams were disappointingly unfinished meaning the swimsuit will maybe last a season i just expect a little better after having two swimdress style suits from this brand i really need that empire waist and a line,1
works well for an all cotton bra,1
beware they run small,0
do not have tummy control just a wrinkled up mess,0
the shoe looked good but i cant say too much else as it was 12 size too big will update when i get new size,1
i received these leggings and returned them immediately they were comfortable but looked so fake they wouldnt ever pass as jean looking leggings,0
the fit is perfect but all small particles is on itall hearall from linens and its very vidible unfortunately had to return it,0
was bigger then planned also the trench coat i received had a dirt spot looking discolorization material felt like that of a rain coat and i was looking for something with a higher grade of material lastly to me the coat i got didnt resemble that of the picture,1
too big for my daughter purchased the 03 months and they are equivalent to a size 2 or 3 my daughter is 2 months the are cute crib shoes not good for walkers,2
i got this case at a discount so i thought id try it out overall it is a good case very protective and looks nice,2
the item is sold as couples matching tshirts but when you add to your cart you have to add each one even although you had initially selected a size for each person you have to buy each one separately and it does not state that,0
eh this is fine i did keep mainly because i wanted to tye dye it the material is alright nothing exciting about it i ordered a medium it was pretty loose in the shorts but tighter on the top,1
this runs small with no stretch had to return so tight in bust38c 55125 very short wouldve worn bike shorts too and fringe was falling immediately,1
these fitso strangely extremely tight at the ball of my foot actually baggy everywhere else the adjustable bit can really only tighten at the part where its tightest i put them on and they twist around my foot i wouldnt try walking in these let alone dancing in them,0
amazing quality and cute packaging 1010 recommend cute and dainty,2
was bought as a give and the receiving lady just love it in like flynn tu,2
thinner than i thought theyd be,1
thin metal,1
good for a throw away pair of sunglasses,0
suspicious its a knock off side pocket zipper is sticky hardware flimsy use everyday so well see how long it lastsbr update returned,1
horrible,0
really like the weight and length of this night shirt the bamboo makes for a lighter material nice length,2
i loved the design of this shirt but it did not fit my body well i am pretty busty 34ddd and found that the tank top gathered at the chestneck and under the arms i think this would fit better on a woman with a slim bodysmall bust or someone who is consistently the same size on the top and bottom,1
dislike it recvd the item thorn apart i ordered bracelet not a stone,0
super comfy,2
low heel and very comfortablebr i bought several colors love them,2
this shirt is pretty snug so much that i checked the label to see if i got the wrong size the material is light and comfy not super thick but doesnt seem seethrough,1
i bought this band for the samsung gear s3 its not the easiest band to install but it stays on well once you do get it installed i was told it doesnt work well for someone with big wrists but it works great for me the only real critique i have is every time i got to a show that involves clapping the band always comes loose its without fail otherwise its great,2
way too big and very sheer,0
i contacted the seller to ask what size to purchase i gave my measurements and was recommended a size 8 i am 57 135 lbs i did need it in a rush and the dress arrived as they said it would it was huge on me and needed fast alterations which cost an additional 150 dollars the dress was nice once altered i ordered red the color was rich and looked elegant in photos,1
a little 34light34 but they go with many of my outfits,1
nice shirt the fit is a bit large for being xl the fabric is not stretchy like most work out shirts which makes it feel comfortable but doesnt dry very quick overall a nice tank top i would recommend,2
seguí las recomendaciones que da el producto que son para talla 3032 sugiere talla 34 y son grandes producto se devolvió y espero comprar de una talla 30 cuando me realicen la devoluciónbr br buen producto,2
logo looks nothing like the picture advertised it looks really cheap disappointing,1
product too small waited too long to return the 2 shorts i ordered anyone need them,1
just what i need to protect my face it folds up nicely too,2
loved them,2
very nice canvas bag its big enough to hold some of my books and folders that i need for school also a laptop if needed it has an inside pocket for smal small items the only reason i gave 4 stars is because it does tend to tear at the seams easy but still very cute bag,2
they smell like chemicals and they were shipped with potpourri in the box so they knew they stunk before they shipped these not sure why they smell so bad they look cute and fit just a little tight,2
im usually disappointed by online purse purchases but not this time i can fit everything i need inside and its light i was worried about being able to fit my oversized checkbook wallet extra clothes for my daughter epi pen case and 2 inhalers and other smaller items but it fits nicely while being well organized i didnt think i would like the zipper opening on the side but its actually very convenient and easy to retrieve things from,2
fit everywhere but the straps hung off of my shoulders,1
recipient liked the product she really liked the color too,0
these feel nice but i dont like the discomfort of the toes being separated its not that uncomfortable just more annoying to me,1
zipper broke after 4 months of occasional use of course after it is past the return date not happy at all with this purchase,0
wish id read the reviews love the shirts but super small had to return the med and size up to the large,1
i put better insoles in them and they quit cramping my feet,1
these worked just fine but 1 of the earrings was on the wire backwards so i had to remove it and fix it myself,1
these christmas pins are very attractive well made and not small good value too,2
just not a fan of the short 634 boots the 834 are perfect,1
the colors dont look the same as they do in the picture not nearly as understated as the picture would lead you to believe overall quality is average at best the sizes tend to run a little on the small side,1
had to return wrong size,1
see through but fits right,0
ehhh for the price they are good they are not polorized,1
product was great but the top of the box was ripped off so giving it as a christmas gift was really embarrassing,1
so happy with this it works so good,2
ive only worn it a few times and it just broke im not happy it was a cute band but doesnt last long at all,1
so i ordered this outfit just for a night out ended up wearing it to go eat ended up being proposed to it fit the occasion items were super stretchy i ordered a extra large because i wasnt sure how it would come im 58 190 363142 and i should have gotten a smaller size the shirt was okay but the skirt was to big i had to pull it all the way to my boobs deff worth the buy tho recommend get a size under what you actually wear,2
i ordered the 2x in this angabriel sports bra which according to the size chart should fit someone that wears a 40c in a sports bra very tight and difficult to zipper while i do like the material and the quality of this sports bra it is much too tight for me to wear when ordering order up a size for a good fit,1
looks ok on fits as expected took forever to arrive and smelled musty like its been packaged moist for a long time,1
just as pictured but the not sure how the seams will hold up after several washes,1
we paid an extra fee to have it a faster delivery time when it arrived the belt was torn and the jewel was broken barely hanging on it seems as if may have been used before,0
its to small i need to send this back and order a larger size,1
socks are described as cushioned and they are much thinner than i had expected,1
i find it very hard to unbuckel and i am afraid to cut because it seems like it would unravel no directions for cutting came with it,0
beautiful and affordable i bought them for my 17 year old daughter and she lost one so i used the buy it again feature,2
high quality fabric is supportive of my 36dd xl was the right fit i was concerned it would be too short but it suited my needs to wear under a wrap dress without bunching up at the waist the rose color is very pretty too,2
poor quality my daughter did not have them in her ear for 24 hours and the stone broke off the front of the earring very disappointed with this product complete waste of money i will never purchase another product from this company ever again,0
umm to big for my face and i dont have a small face had it over 5 months still sitting here,0
i based my size choice off of my chest size which matched up to getting a medium leotard once it arrived and i tried it on my chest did not fit in at all very far from flattering i will be returning the leotard back soon,1
put it on my daughters lunch box handle to remind the lunch lady of which child has celiac disease the lunch lady watches for messy crumbs in my childs area my daughter is proud to have it there,2
great fit for 2 year old sizing is right on quality of sewing is iffy had 2 weeks and already a seam has ripped and stuffing is coming out,1
the fabric is very good but runs extremely large,0
cute it fit good and comfy lasted about a year before the bottoms started falling apart also the strings are annoying so i had to cut them,1
very disappointed in this product i typically love everything i get from amazon the color of the earrings is nowhere near this deep amethyst color as shown in the photo they are very pale like lilac and they do not match my other amethyst pendant and ring that i have additionally the hook on the back of the earring is so short that they fell out of my ear three times the first day i wore them the last time i lost one for good i now have one earring that is the wrong color very bad purchase,0
a little big,1
with the tent pitch in the middle thats how it looked when wearing since it was too big if it had been a smaller size it may have looked better,0
looks cute but its way too heavy for my 3 year old,1
the belt was purchased in january 2019,0
not as advertised didnt receive the colors shown,0
i liked the colour,0
i am usually a small to a medium depending on brand i ordered this for a 6070s themed party the dress is so loose that i am not able to wear it its a cute concept but these sizes must be wrong would not recommend i am 51 130 pounds as reference,0
the title stated paper boxes and the closeup showed paper but what arrived was cheesy plastic in cheap plastic colors not nice at all cheap colors cheap construction but price not reflected in quality yup im returning these,0
the material was clingy not what i expected,0
it fits but tighter than i hoped i have a big head but figured this would be fine snugger than should be,1
i love this umbrella when it arrived i couldnt wait for it to rain it performs exactly as described i would highly recommend itbr br edited review well i loved this umbrella but it hasnt held up very well three issues to date 1 one of the prong tips came off the umbrella and this makes it difficult to close the umbrella 2 when i push the button to open the umbrella it only opens partway i then have to fiddle with the part you push up to fully open it not something i like doing in the rain 3 the oring near the handle is loose it doesnt appear to be doing anything damaging but it was one more thing that made me think this umbrella was poorly madebr br oh and i never did understand why the 34c34 handle was so cool it doesnt seem to fit over anything like a shopping cart handle if i put it in the cart i run the risk of forgetting it im going to look for the 34original34 brand of this upside down umbrella the idea is awesome,0
still nice shirts but the fabric seems thinner and lighter than in the past,1
danced all night in these at my girlfriends wedding didnt have to take them off,2
they are okay glasses and blocks some of the light but my eyes are still tired after i take them off the glasses themselves are kind of flimsy and my nose piece kept falling off so i emailed the seller and told him my problem and mind you my glasses was still under warranty and he replied back saying i need to ship the glasses to him which meant i would have to pay for shipping also i asked him why and the seller never replied back so i had to go through amazon support to get my glasses fixed and amazon did not charge me shipping and sent me a new pair,0
this heart looks nothing like the picture on amazon,0
the shoes are very pretty and the length was spot on in a 7 but the toes were so cramped i am returning as i am not sure the toe box will ever be comfortable the foot bed seemed very comfy though,1
too tight on the calfs but that could be my calfs feet feel great,1
not the best my son was super excited about this but the fit is very small and the fabric is not good quality it is very itchy he isnt one to complain about fabric usually he wont wear it too bad because it is a cool design,0
beautiful earringshighly recommend,2
the compartments are to small and it is to short,0
bought this for my mother she loves it and get complements all the time i only give it a 4 out of 5 because the chain is really cheap,2

im in college so i am constantly staring at a computer screen which strains my eyes and gives me headaches all the time i got these glasses and since it has helped a lot with my headaches they are a flexible plastic and dont break which i like they are also super cute and sometimes i wear them just for the style,2
this bracelet is way to small,0
the belt buckle fell apart today only had it since august,0
just but too small,1
after a few months of use the leather has worn down and lost some color ill need to replace it soon it does look nice though,1
love it and its so comfortable,2
i really liked this watch when i got it i have a very small wrist and to find a band that is small enough for me can be very difficult i was happy when i got it and found that it fit perfectly there is a catch tho after a little were the band the part i was so wanting broke it turns out that the band is glued to its self to make the loop for the pin not stitched how hard would it have been to put a couple stitches in that spot now i cant use it because i again can not find a band that fits me,1
my wife has been wearing for 7 years now without a single problem amazing watch and longevity next watch will be one of these if i ever have to buy her another,2
these slippers are very hard to get on they are very flimsy and my son ends up walking on the back part that goes above the heel,0
i have the hot pink and love it it has tons of slots for card a section that has a snap closure a zippered section and some hidden sectiions,2
order above your size this is small,0
i send it back because it never works,0
the quality is poor and you have to put it together on your own save yourself money and use your childs favorite hat and go to a hobby store to buy heavy duty plastic and velcro and make it your self,0
finenot the greatest fabric,1
ive only been using this bag for two weeks during the first week the large zipper pocket broke yesterday the large strap snapped off all the metal pieces are cheaply made and the bag is nearly unusable already it was a waste of money and im very disappointedbr on the bright side the smaller pouch compartment was good for my drinks it kept my clothes clean and dry the shoe compartment was very helpful as well but the overall quality is terrible and didnt even last long at all if you have hardly anything to put in it and keep the bag light it might last but i doubt it,0
these were the cheapest bracelets i have ever received on line they were made for a child maybe in elementary school i will not be buying from inblue again,0
so adorable color very bright lights are well placed and love that has option to change the light pattern wand and crown light up as well size appears to be accurate i cant wait to give this to my grandaughter,2
nice but more like a training bra,1
cheap,0
definitely not what is pictured foam like mastery does its job,1
the size of these are perfect they fit perfectly into any suitcase and close tightly to fit multiple items of clothing in one case,1
very stylish purse great quality,2
i really wanted to love this to give my shorter tops a bit of length the problem is that it was really long with about 834 of lace and it was almost down to my knees not a look i wanted at 5234 135 38f top sent it back,1
these are well made sturdy shoes i bought another pair,2
i love the cut of these baseball tees the fit is true to size but i sized up and pair this shirt with colored organics leggings for my 2 year old son so cute and fun,2
if you want jewelry for a specific occasion or only want to wear them a handful of times this is the product for you i was hoping to keep them for a while but they started turning black not long after i bought them,1
look cute but heavy,0
this is a cute blouse the long sleeves are lace and i am cold most of the time and knew that the sleeves would make me cold,1
i bought this item for a little compression but the material does not compress other then that its good to workout,1
i picked a pack of these up thinking that calvin klein has been around so these might be good they are over priced fruit of the looms the cotton feels more like cardboard half way through a hot working day they stretch out a get loose search for some david archy bamboo they come in a 4 pk for like 27 and are super soft and light,0
says 03 months more like 69,0
i was pleasantly surprised at the sturdiness and cute styling of these glasses i received a box of 5 cute glasses for less than the price of one pair at a local big box store since i am constantly misplacing glasses these are just what i needed highly recommend,2
the bottoms were perfect the top however is far too large,0
i like the material a lot and the colors are great,2
in terms of making your buttonless collars stay up 5 stars i just find it somewhat uncomfortable to have a stiff piece of plastic around my neck i wish it came slightly smaller,1
for the money its pretty good the secondary swivel clasp dont know what its real name is doesnt secure all that strong time will tell if i need to give it a slight bend to increase the shutting 34click34 i dont think thats a deal breaker though otherwise its pretty solid and looks great on my skx009br i will say this although i would buy this strap again i might not buy it again confusing yeah i know here is what i mean its nice if you want a jubilee strap this is a nice one to upgrade your watch or replace a brokenstretched strap here is the twist i bought this strap at the same time i ordered my seiko skx009 i also ordered a nice 11 redblue striped nylon strap which looks out of this world if i had it to do over again i dont think i would but this jubilee strap and instead i would buy more of the nylon straps they are so interchangeable and colorful they are superfast to swap out like 5 seconds and at 11ea you can get one is every color imaginablebr br nice strap yes of course if you want a jubilee strap this is a strong choicebr the best strap for a skx007 or 009 not in my opinion try the nylon first these jubilee straps arent going anywhere,1
this bag is really cute love the teal color and the was so happy and surprised to find it comes with and extra cross body strap that is much narrower and solid teal maybe i missed it in the details it a good size holds all my stuff but the front flap is a bit stiff and so is the back pocket the front flap slaps shut every time i open it to look for something inside and i find the pocket in the back useless not big enough for my cell phone and wouldnt want to chance car keys in it since it an open pocket but it really is a cute bag and im keeping it,1
this four pack of velvet chokers is good for the price however i will say that they dont have any stretch to them so if i put it on too tight and the choker pulls then it will break the clasp pulls off which is fixable but annoying besides that i do think they are really cute on,1
nothing wrong with the tail so far just had the wrong impression of how big it was going to be i read the description of the product but i was still expecting it to be a bit more full like the picture i intended to use it for a costume i was making but its really only for a purse or backpack accessory,1
very small xl fit more like a medium,0
gloves were okay got the job done used them in colorado at 17 and my hands were still freezing i ended up buying little hand warmers to put in them to keep my fingers from freezing nothing special finger grip to use touchscreen phone was pointless i had to take the glove off each time to use my phone screen,0
im short waisted they go up higher than i like bit still keeping them,1
look great,2
shrank more than i expected,1
way bigger than i thought they were going to be,0
i loved the charm it was used on a bracelet for a special friend,2
it was very thin material and seemed too oversized i would recommend ordering a size down the color and design is pretty to wear on halloween but the thin material would require a cami underneath unless you dont mind a seethrough top,1
this ring runs small im also not sure that its real sterling silver it doesnt have 925 stamped on the inside of the ring its pretty just not what its advertised as,1
i have ordered two of these now and both have broken i loved them both but went to a buckle band this time around,1
much prettier in person perfect for a young girl and it has a beautiful shine,2
description is wrong this isnt functional while i didnt expect much there is no magnification at all,0
it looks like a mans shirt its ok,1
pretty funky better too big than too small anyway just for fun makes my husband laugh when i wear them and they work with flip flops,1
this swimsuit looks nice and fit in the waist as expected but the top was too tight and it was too short overall im 51 so i do not have a long torso by any means but the suit pulls down and down not cover support or really even look good on my chest,0
so i got these black work boots for only 16 which was a deal however the are very heavy and very slippery they seem well made but if i tried them on at the store first i would not buy them they will sit in my closet for years im afraid but they may work for someone else but not me,1
purchased this nice shirt in yellow the quality is so soft very comfy and fits very well love to wear this type of shirt material especially during summer,2
the look was perfect but they were longer than expected and after 1 wear the maroon and gold ones strip in the back you tuck the small end into fell off,1
this is a classic example of you get what you pay for typical chinese made to fit feet they have no clue how to size measurement guide is off by at least a full sizeor size and a half too large im not going to bother returning because i feel sorry for amazon that they have to sell such a poor product,1
extremely small for an extra large would fit a toddler super small and cheap,0
el color es genial,2
this package came sealed but with 3 different kinds of undershirts they all meet the requirements of a undershirt but its a little sketchy that it seemed like this is a pack of manufacturer rejects or something like that,1
very very small i bought this for my 7 year old but it is so small my 4 year old is using it otherwise its ok love the pattern sort of thin material,0
be sure to read previous reviews not made to last pocket tore after 3rd time wearing other than durability ii love it just needed to give it some extra tlc with the sewing kit,1
i did not like the fabric on this dress it was almost spandexlike and was not comfortable against the skin nor was it flattering,0
surprised this ran small size up if you plan on wearing a sweater or sweatshirt underneath the torso of this is lightly lined the arms are not which i found a little odd the material is lightweight which is to its advantage i got the burgundy which is a lovely true color,1
had these a couple of months fit great and are waterproof i use rendered bear fat as a sealer on the leather works about the same as mink oil happy that they are made in the usa,2
too long,2
ive been wearing reefs for several years and just love them,2
cute fashion necklace,1
why is everyone rating these so high when they are not an accurate kids size ordered a size 3 for my 9 year old and they were at least 2 inches too long and the velcro portion doesnt even touch the top of his feet super disappointed size down if youre buying,0
this dress is gorgeous i wore it to a retirementbirthday party and the gals and guys gave me lots of compliments my only complaint is before i even wore the dress i noticed a small tear in one of the back seams by the waist i had to mend it myself before wearing it,2
this chain is absolutely gorgeous it is a 1mm so obviously is a delicate piece of jewelry and should be treated with care it looks very delicate and it sparkles with the light there is no way you can beat the price for the quality,2
i ordered a size large even though i normally wear a medium because i wanted to make sure they fit comfortably but they are incredibly tight through the thigh and loose below the knee i have had this same problem several other times purchasing this brand but my very favorite leggings that fit perfectly came from them so i keep trying at one point i purchased two of the same size and the same style and you could visibly see the difference in size between them i think at this point i will stop trying and move on to a different brand,0
love the looks of the watch but it does not live up to timex standards loses about 1 second per day sometimes 2 as others have said thats not good by todays standards more like something from the windup era,1
my son is a seabee so when i saw this hat i had to have it it fits great all the threats and seams are tight i get lots of compliments on it i highly recommend buying it,2
item as described and packaged exceptionally prime so delivery was fastbr would definitely do business again,2
very well made and solid great price and delivery,2
pretty combo made a good christmas gift,1
vneck way too big,1
love these very happy with them,2
these risissida women faux leather leggings high waisted pleather pants are well sewn and have a stretchy polyester faux leather finish the two front horizontal metal hand pockets zip and unzip but are just for show no pockets under the zippers but there are 2 real back pockets as well a notch at the ankles and a horizontal striping pad area at the knees for design effect i was hoping to wear these in a form fitting way underneath larger tops or even skirts but these are fairl loose on me i wear a size 7 us womens pant and got these medium i realize its tough to get a good fit with s m l type sizing so im not really criticizing that i only deducted a star because these dont look very flattering on me being oddly tight at the crotch but loose around the legs these are well made though and if you like the design itd be worth it to try them on at least since we are all built differently and its tough to buy pants on the internet,2
the shirt is very cute the material is very comfortable and good price,2
birthday present for my boyfriend and it looks great,1
the fit is way to small buy 1 or 2 sizes up,1
for the price it was great it fit well and the print didnt crack,2
they band looks nice no issues with it functionallyyet but it does fit very loosely and makes clicking noises due to poor connection design,0
l does not run large enough xxl is too large xl is apparently not available or in stock disappointed,0
comfortable and cute some of the best droid inspired footwear ive even owned sturdy in the wash so far great for any fan of the new star wars films or even the uninitiated sock fan,2
looks a little bit on the cheap side but it was 28 hardware especially looks cheap,0
tiny is misleadingits a fairly average size pendant suitable for kids and adultsbr br im not a statement jewelry person and prefer to buy fairly inexpensive silver toned necklaces with small pendants that i can layer or switch out frequently oh and i also love butterflies i was hesitant to buy this since there were no reviews but i received a discount on the necklace for my own review so i took the plungebr br the necklace was prime eligible and arrived in 2 days this is pretty rare for amazon jewelry at this price point i usually find it comes from overseas and takes weeks to get it arrived in a huge lightly padded envelope which offered very little protection and is a waste of materials luckily the necklace was safe and sound sealed in a small plastic baggie with a cute business cardthank you from the seller who is a small california based businessbr br the necklace arrived twisted with a small knot so i fixed that up and noticed instantly how short the chain was i only wear 182134 chains and i knew immediately this was not the 1834 that was promised in the product description i measured it and it came in under 1634 it was almost a choker on me however both the chain and the butterly are lightweight and comfortable the butterfly sits nicely without constantly flipping over and the wings are soft rounded edges so it is comfortable to wear i just switched the pendant out to another chain the chain itself isnt bad basic chain that you find with most costume pendant necklaces the clasp is easy to openclose and is securebr br the butterfly itself is adorable it is not quite as shiny as i saw online which i prefer because it gives it a nicer look the metal it is described as bronze does not bend or misshape and the detail on the butterfly is pretty i am glad that the butterfly isnt tiny it is dainty and perfect for a simple lookbr br it is appx 1434 x 1434 for people like me that dont measure in millimetersbr br for the price the detail of the butterfly and the 2 day prime shipping this was a great buy and i will wear the butterfly often this summer on another chain and on a charm bracelet however minus 2 stars as the chain was 234 shorter than described and a better packaging solution would offer more protection to the item and less waste no loss of stars for packaging i hope seller fixes the description of the chain size to match the actual product,1
i liked these at first look nice and feel nice until about 3 weeks later the paddinginner sole starts to detach and bunch up behind your toes now there is no padding under the toes its bunched up just between my toes and pad of my foot very uncomfortable now unfortunately its pop art the return date i should hgh save returned them sooner when i first noticed it i will most likely buy the sonoma brand ones from kohls again like i had before these bc they lasted 3 years,0
already little strings coming off after a few weeks of wear,1
this is a great watch for the price i really enjoy mine it has all the information i need on the face and its easy to set up and use highly recommended,2
way too small,0
thank you,2
this item shrank to the size of a toddler shirt when i washed it,0
i love this bodysuit it looks amazing the only thing for me is i have a long torso so i kinda rides up but its still great,2
not as represented and now i cant even return,0
these shoes stretch at least one half size over the first few weeks of wear because they only come in whole sizes i would definitely buy the size smaller than your normal size i love this shoe its like walking on marshmallows,2
la parte de arriba muy fea y arrugada,1
they look great however they are a little thinner and flimsier than the store bought type at costco and there was no case for protection a bit disappointing,1
the perfect beach hat it is gorgeous and fits nicely adjustable too love it and cant wait to wear to the beach soon,2
material is too thin and shows everything,0
this is a toy thought i was buying a watch it as not turn on,0
was not informed that would need to sign for order had to go to post ofgice to pick it up inconvenient and order made no mention of that regularly get packages,1
quite disappointed in these they are not comfortable at all and feel like youre walking on a balancing beam,0
better than expected fits exactly as described,2
lots of unraveling of waist and leg bands with every wash disappointed in that,0
i am normally between large and xlarge but saw how others had reviewed that it ran large it definitely did i decided to get a large and its almost too loose but i do wish i had gotten a medium still a very cute skirt and i absolutely love the material,2
very cutenice quality,2
shortit,1
huhbr who made this size chartbr ummmno honey this isnot holding the girls in and you definitely aint jogging stretching bending walking breathing not in thisnot today,0
like a lot of people here i wore these jeans exclusively for years and then had to mostly give up my issue was the inseam length they used to make all their styles with a 3634 inseam and now they dont i still buy black 505s without too much trouble black jeans are a kind of nyc staple you can wear them to work and then to a nice restaurant and then to punk rock show in a loft no one has time to go home and change clothes herebr br but for most of the blue denim they stop at 3434 for a while i was taking advantage of levis incredibly sloppy quality controlif you grabbed five pairs of 3434 jeans off the shelf theyd all be different lengths sometimes by as much as 234 if i got lucky id find a long pair in a denim color i likedbr br that got old ive mostly switched to buying japanese raw denim which is higher quality and comes in a million sizes and cuts usually with 36 to 3734 inseams the jeans cost five or more times as much as levis but fit better look better and i find they last at least twice as long so its not quite as outrageous as it soundsbr br but for plain old black im happy enough for now with the standby black 505s,1
i liked these boots i used them for a costume but i could see myself using them with actual outfits good fit and the price isnt bad at all,2
one of the three shirts had discoloration like faded,1
love this bag other then the fact that its starting to come apart after about 2 monthsbr br update 81919br recieved my 2nd bag after my first one started to break this one is breaking too i only have a small amount of items in my bag but again it brokebr not every day wearbr update was contacted by their customer service and are sending me a new bag so happy because i do love this bag its so versatile,0
these went up too high on the top of the foot so they arent noshow for the particular shoes im wearing fashion sneakers or slipons they might be okay for regular sneakers though thing is i dont mind having my socks show some with regular sneakers,1
not compression and size is off order a large and its small for me,1
i think this was intended for larger chests maybe i missed that and its on me im a 34b and this didnt even offer enough support to walk around it felt way too big i ordered another size small champion c9 and that one was great but it wasnt as cutebr br the material is pretty and soft great stretch it just offers not even a minimal support usually i can get away with a low impact bra for my runs and this didnt even feel ok for my walk,1
it came with 1 headband only i needed 2,0
i ordered this jacket in olive green from another retailer size l the sleeves are a little tight i ordered this one in the tan brown color size xl it fits exactly like the l i compared seam to seam there was no difference not what i expected was hoping for a little more room in the xl so i sent it back its a cute casual jacket with feminine seaming nipped in at the waist not boxy the oversized buttons are really cute but a pain to open close i would only wear it open so that doesnt matter to me wish i had bought it in other colors when it was available the thin french terry knit is cool comfortable stretch helps with snug sleeves im a 36ddd couldnt button the size l closed but i plan to wear it open anyway i would have given this 5 stars but the sizing thing was weird a little disappointing,2
im using a heat press and i first tried 330 for 30 seconds then i tried 305 for 1015 seconds and got the exact same results it ripples up right away and then never adheres to the fabric incredibly disappointed will be requesting a refund,0
this is a beautiful roomy and light vera bradley piece made so well and holds up beautifully washes well beautiful pattern vera bradley quality that you love very comfortable to use all day,2
they are a good replacement but a little expensive for what you get plus they are a little on the long side i had to trim the straps and use a small torch to seal the ends,1
too hard to slip on over glasses returning item,0
me and sally like to dress up in the bedroom this is a little big on both of our heads but has been a great addition to my larry mahan edition milano cowboy hat,2
pretty top arms are extremely small i bought larger size loose everywhere else but arms disproportionate,0
the bottoms fit perfectly and were great to wear i wear a 36d and the top was way too small luckily i was only looking for a bottom when i ordered this so i was happy with it overall,1
great product for the value small durable inexpensive ive noticed that on this model the light button does not light up the entire display like the older models when you press the light button there is on a yellow light on the left side of the display it does not completely illuminate the whole display but it still works do i like the light no but i bought this watch for its other characteristics like its size durability and price would i buy another one yes,2
cheap material after the wrinkles came out it looks cute needs to be washed carefully as i am already seeing tiny holes at the seams,1
i wanted to love this dress but definitely didnt meet expectations it looked as pictured the lace was perfect color on spot until i put it on it fit perfectly around my chest but was like wearing a potato sack the material was swishy like wind breaker material and the dress fell way past my knees unfortunately returned this item,0
i really wanted to like this shirt but unfortunately the collar is very high and narrow in circumference not flattering on me at least ive never worn a henley of this cut before the fabric itself was nice though,0
if your looking for a defined scallop neck line as appears on site pass on this dress the neckline is scant and will not lie down fabric style and fit are okay,1
its a cute cuff but i could not sleep in it the points are so sharp for the time it took to get in my ear it wasnt worth taking it in and out to sleep,1
totally love my new wallet i used to have an older one that i used for almost 6 years and it was very old so i decided to changed it for this dockers wallet i was looking for space and man this wallet has space,2
do not buy this doesnt come with a way to charge the light i regret this purchase,0
the shirts in the order are too small the navy shorts were goid only the khaki shorts were wrong not what was ordered,0
the stitching on the toe started to come apart the first day they were worn and had to be repaired disappointed,0
much smaller than they appear online there really isnt any copper on it,1
i have been a loyal olukai customer for more than 13 years this will be my last pair i had them for 2 months and are already coming undone it used to be that these shoes would last for years 2 months this will be my last pair sadly i love the grip but cant justify buying shoes that last 2 months,0
materials are top notchbr i definitely cannot complain about how solid the bag feelsbr the design where the strap compresses the bag is also goodbr however the strap material and angle make for a painful experiencebr i ended up almost bleeding due to how the strap dug into the base of my neck when walking aroundbr i used this for one day on a weeklong trip and gave up on using it due to the constant painful rubbingbr really cannot recommend this at all,0
the fabric on this dress is thin and the slit is surprisingly high i returned it immediately,0
i wore it out one day for a morning walk and later to go pokemon hunting it was cute and didnt make my hair feel like it was burning on my headbr br only thing was i could not get it to stay on if i were to just skip a step or jog for 2 seconds i tried bobby pinning it down but it looks very weird through the mesh part need to figure out a way to keep it on my headbr br i even had my hair in a pony tail going through the back and it still falls right off so not ideal for joggingjumpingskipping of any sort mind you i also have a normal size head i kept the adjustment in the back as it fitted,1
poor quality and it fits big on me,0
no really a fan of these insoles they just feel very uncomfortable in every shoe ive tried so far,0
not good quality and runs too small,0
too small and uncomfortable,0
80 cottonbr 20 polyesterbr br does not add up to 100 cotton this is the second brand in the last two weeks i purchased that claims to be 100 cotton that is not,1
soft but not for working out no compression if thats what youre looking for,0
too small for my 7b foot returned,0
great for wearing at parties and occasions like halloween awesome and really funny,2
this bathrobe is very comfortable and warm i loved it,2
this is great if youre looking for a robe its a wrap dress and the picture is so cute but unfortunately the actual turn out of the dress isnt like the picture at all it has no shape and reminds me of a bridal robe that you wear when youre getting ready for your wedding day the material was pretty and thick but thats the only nice thing about this dress,0
it was nice to find running shoes in narrow sizes however i normally wear an 8 12 n and read that these ran small so ordered a 9 n they were still too small a 9 12 would probably have worked but it wouldve cost me an extra 30 to 34exchange34 three stars bc i didnt even try them for their purpose,1
ordered sizes small but it fit frumpy and 2 sizes too big im 53 135 pounds the material and color was nice but the stitching was low quality,1
the picture of the product has a t shirt over the top elastic closure there is a 2 inch white elastic with draw string area i expected them to be all black with white stripes the adidas logo is also a screen print not embroidered the inseam measured 85 inches from crotch to end of material its a bit to long for my husbands liking will probably return,0
these pajamas fit very well they are comfortable too they arent the softest pajamas but they arent bad at all the design is nice and the colors are good,2
super cute fit as expected,2
very soft material but it was like wearing a sack im 5834 160lbs and usually wear an 8 or 10 if i had thought it would be more flattering i would have exchanged it for a small but the style was very unflattering,1
the big problem is that the waist is very small and the pants are toobr the top is 60br i am a petite and wanted to have room but there isnt anybr it would have to be 2xlarge to be large,1
bought this for my sons 1st birthday party his head is in the 90th percentile and this hat was huge on him it was cute for the little bit he left it on but since it was so big it covered up his ears and drooped more so he wouldnt keep it on,1
when i write reviews i typically do so in a certain fashion first i write my context then dive into the pros the cons and finally i give an overview and final thoughts for this matching set of pjs not necessary all i have to say is this set is life i wish i could wear them all the timebr br not only are they cute af theyre comfortable af my sisterinlaw saw me in them when we woke up in the morning and she said you look so cute where you going lol totally totally recommend,2
i followed the exact size chart they gave and it doesnt fit i cant even close the zipper so for me it was a waste of money,0
light weight nice looking however the photos showed it with black lettering and the symbol in black it is silver on silver so its hard to see what it is overall happy with product just wish it had contrast on the face,2
i little small but wearable somewhat small,1
comfy,2
im hat size 6263 or 7 347 78 and this hat is perfect and soft it seems well made it is certainly warm,2
i ordered the largest size to accomodate a cloth diaper the romper is quite small and barely fits my 17 lb 6 mo old the workmanship is low quality i had to knot a few stiches that were unraveling and resew an unraveled seam prior to washing,0
beautiful,2
i thought the color wouldve been a bit lighter but its straight up light brown regardless love the hat,2
best socks ever last a loooonngg time and im pretty heavy and am rough on socks have used thorlo for over 10 years now,2
i paid 20 each for three clubs and two of the three broke immiediately way too much for cheap plastic,0
i love the design but it runs way too small returned,0
i have multiple types of darn tough socks that i love but not these ultra lites all of my other socks fit perfectly but these run much smaller than the other models i have purchased from darn tough they are uncomfortably tight and seem to slide around on my feet,1
didnt realize mens size,0
too too small and cheap quality,0
this is super cute a bit thinner material than expected and the slit is very high it was too small for me in the bust area i am a 42d,2
classic cheap casio watch made in thailand not china,2
the tights are really nice the fabric and they way they looked on mebr buuuut and theres a huge butbr the bad thing is the belt per sebr because it was broken in the part where you spouse to closebr the fabric is broken and the piece is missing,0
this is surprisingly great quality and exactly what i was looking forneeded definitely worth it,2
the crotch hits too low on me and i was surprised that the large is smaller than i expected i washed before wearing but air dried in the hopes it would soften up sort of the typical junky stuff i have come to expect from china,1
top runs way too big and shapeless sleeves did not stay cuffed material is not chiffon as described,0
i like this belt and it looks nice on but the material is kind of cheap its a thin thickness wise flimsy belt you cant really tell when youre wearing it but you can feel it and it seems like it could tear or rip easily also the size seems to run a little big its a little long for me and i did order the correct size for my waist measurement and per their sizing chart its a unique fashionable belt but its not worth the price of 1599 i would order it again but only if were 800 or under,1
my 22 year old son wears a largeextra large in coats hoodies tshirts and jackets i ordered an xxxlarge and he cant even put it on patches are nice but he cant wear it,0
disappointed in the length too short for me at my age,1
great price but flimsy it is a great design and very effective in the sunlight,1
fake poor quality scratchy came in plain undescript plastic opened up the shirts and there was a pea sized hole in the first shirt and strings hanging out does not feel or look like the real thing,0
it is small the nose bridge part is very painful no matter how small your nose isif like me you already cut the chin strap thinking it will fit less painful but it did not or just dont have the time to wait for another mask dont worry you have not completely wasted money if it does not fit you can cut and alter it or if nothing is working it and you it can be made in to the dc comic version of cat woman especially if you all ready have glasses,1
i have ordered many pairs of sunglasses from amazon as i live in fl and you can never be without a pair these happen to have the reader magnification on the outside of the lenses which means it is very visible to anyone looking at you that you have readers on i didnt really think it was a big deal until i started seeing them in pictures that were being taken i personally would not purchase these again because of that reason,1
crazy about these earrings so cute,2
the material is rough otherwise its an ok tshirt fits nicely i will not buy another because i dont like the material,1
also looks super cute in the picture and even in person but the bottom is so gargantua guy complained they didnt even reach out to me i needed a smaller bottle but i had to have the larger top ridiculous for anyone thats not the same exact size i tried shrinking it you name it i cant even wear it its so big theyre like grandma pants,0
very cute but quite wide at the top of the top rubs quite a bit at the upper part of the bout,1
i keep it with me everyday as a reminder of loss hope and spirituality,2
i returned these they were too small,0
good band perfect size very stylish,1
way too small the picture is definitely meant to be misleading but i didnt take into account how ridiculously small this was going to be reminds me of a quote from the movie zoolander what is this a center for ants i should have definitely paid attention to the width and length listed obviously i knew it was going to be smaller than the picture but come on oh and yeah significant other hated it 1 star,0
covers face and neck completely perfect if just sitting but not for activity such as gardening or riding a bike,2
cheap quality,0
these are smallmuch smaller than they should be per size i normally wear a large but i ordered this in a xl it is not big enough two sizes larger than normal would be about right,1
fit was about a half size too large aside from that once i got a smaller size 7 instead of 75 they fit comfortably and are so cute,2
the color was pretty the fit was okay,1
broke on the bridge after a week,0
pretty dress looks nice on the ruffle lays kind of funny in some places but all in all im happy with it,2
great product the 1st week but then they all had holes in them very poorly made will not be buying again,0
the description says these are clipon ear rings they are not,0
these suck ive had them less than 3 months and the tread already has a hole never buying them again,0
love this brand and style however these are not photocromatic as i was hoping for and are no where dark enough so want a blue mirror glass in this style,1
as advertised,1
they are pretty but the clasp is difficult you have to thread the part that goes through your ear into the hoop on the other side its tricky and if you accidentally run your fingers through your hair you can pull it out easily but they are nice my husband loves them on me,1
nice soft socks great to wear with tennis shoes your feet stay warm but dont sweat very comfortable will buy again,2
fits great,2
this is not a key ring i was badly deceived too small like a joke already requested refund badly disappointed,0
knocked off a star because the heather hunter green just looks gray does not look olive or greenish at all like in the picture but i love this brand yoga pants they fit well and are not seethrough when you squatbend over these run a little large i normally wear a small for bottoms but had to order down a size to an xs i have bigger thighsbutt and normally cant even get an xs on the size small kept creeping down so i had to keep pulling them up all day very annoying switched to xs and they stay in place perfect,1
the colors and design are extraordinary the weave is heavy which is okay for cold weather i suppose they are quality socks and others would probably appreciate the warmth the feel is not pleasing to me my preference is for a lighter sock in warm weather and a wool blend for cold weather,1
soso,1
some colors seem to be weaker than others,1
not the best quality seems and what not show but from far away still cute,1
excursions are my favorite sauconys so comfortable i can wear them all day its hard to find sneakers that you like and for me these are perfect good support comfortable and they look good,2
these are quality for the price i plan on giving one away,2
looks cheap,1
it looks like a childs toy my wife wore it once and it fell apart i would not buy this product again,0
back storybr i have been searching for the perfect heel for my wedding dress whats perfect 1 comfortable 2 color 3 heel heightbr br prosbr these shoes are comfortable af as soon as i put them on i was so happy because they were so comfybr the heel height is around 3 maybe even 25 which is the perfect heel height for mebr br consbr unfortunately the mocha color has a very reddish tint to it and is more like a mauve than a mochabr br overallbr i would recommend these i would have kept them but since i am matching this to my wedding dress which has a latte colored underlay there was no way i could keep them without having a major fashion faux pas,1
its a very pretty print but i wish colors were a bit more vibrant for the price im paying but its ok,1
these were the best thing for my achilles as the padding area is awesome where they fall apart is that they literally fall apart elsewhere within 2 months of playing ultimate disc the underside ripped open on the bottom of the heel as there is a lot of juking and cutting involved probably be okay for runners not making intense change of direction but football and soccer players you may have different results follow washing instructions do by hand id give it 4 stars if it would at least last 6 months to a year fortunately the padded area does remain intact so i still find them useful even if they are torn the comfort outshines the annoyance,1
i love betsey johnson and these shoes are perfect the box is fantastic the gem is fantastic not cheap looking i am in love ps i bought the ivory,2
okay,1
kind of an odd dress,1
not bad sports bras for the price ran a tad small and the removable cups bunch up and look awful,0
really cute,2
i gave this to my best friend as a wedding gift she wore it during her wedding and she loves it so much i also want to thank you for shipping it on time,2
i ordered my normal size m and found the outfit to be far too large it is very very stretchy material and didnt lay right on my torso,0
love them,2
i ordered based on size chart and im thrilled its perfect its a nice fitting tank great material excellent quality not at all like the usual thin or cheap material we often get from tank tops purchased online this is the real deal heavy duty durable and high quality fabric excellent length i like long tanks and the design is super big so much nicer than it looked in the picture and it already looked great in the picture im going to be ordering a back up for it to have for the future its that great i highly recommend it,2
im 5 146 i got the small because i wanted to wear this under my scrubs this fits a little tight around the breast area but didnt notice it much after i wore it for a few minutes it conforms to your body and stays put the material feels very nice and it was very comfortable it was warm but not overly suffocating absolutely love it and will be buying more,2
it looks nice but is a bit heavy and not a great strength band so the ring will slide and flip and didnt stay on my finger well but with a little hot glue it helped a lot,1
i loved this too until i washed it and it pulled terribly im very disappointed because its so cute and comfortable with leggings i ordered the wine color and color is nice it fits true to size,0
my nephew loves daniel tiger and he loved the pajamas id definitely say get a size up,2
nice quality bought this for my costume and was so disappointed when i received it as it is not for short people even with some heels this would be way to long im 51 and it was at least 6 inches to long i didnt have time to have it professionally hemmed so i sent it back,2
bello,2
am wearing it now i forget its on my neck and yes it basically keeps you warm but flimsy material and does not look great after a few days but hey its 14 bux,1
to big keep falling off my face,0
i loved this time piece absolutely gorgeous to look at the dial is large but not as large as some of the other stuhrling watches that ive purchased the difference is negligible a few millimeters is all but you can tell when sitting side by side the colors accentuate each other nicely and the band looks good i really like the dual time on the watch and how they trade off roman numerals and english numbers the open heart design is neat but is somewhat hidden by the center connection piece overall this watch is great you wont be disappointed they even sent me the watch with the correct time as i opened the package wonderful,2
more like a childs size lg,1
will not open backs without a groove,0
the beads are huge and they fall off my wrist,0
this shirt has gotten me many smiles it fits great i am short 5ft1 and 135 lbs the shirt hugs all the right places and doesnt bunch up in the back love it,2
this was a good purchase love the pockets stay up when working out i really enjoy the top there is a band at the top which keeps the shorts up but its a really thick band at least compared to the leggings i have no rolling issues for me either im 56 145 waist 29 hip 37,2
these did not fit me like compression socks should the description states they are tightest at the ankles but for me there was almost no compression at the ankle and it was fairly tight on my calves quality wise they were full of loose threads and some pairs had snags in spots feelwise they have a slick synthetic feel when worn the prints are cute in the bag not as attractive all stretched out i wear a size 859w shoe and ordered sm as a rn i have worn many pairs of compression socks and these are the least favorite i have ever tried a return,0
most comfortable pair of shoes ive ever owned i am a hairdresser who stands all day and these are wonderful my feet are not sore at the end of the day they are also great for when you do a lot of walking i highly recommend these,2
they apparently fit well and he likes them,2
very cute but a bit see through and it fits like a junior size with a 46 so sending back,1
very good quality,2
like this its made nice as well they did a good job whoever made it,1
terrible socks they are absolutely huge on my son he hates how they feel scratchy on his legs,0
looked nice and fit was true to size however did not like the feel while walking in them the arch was a little off on my foot so it felt weird returned them,1
fair value for these glasses needed a 34wide beam34 pair for my 75834 head good beam temple to temple width and arms length lens are very light in color and probably not good on the brightest days but good for driving and polarized gave pretty clear accurate vision metal frames are about what you would expect for this price point will probably not take much abuse and feel somewhat fragile frames fit was a bit tightdid not want to manually 34shape34 these as afraid they would break or be deformed go to your eye specialist if you need to loosen them like the silicone treatment on the armear pieces,1
after a week of hanging it in my car the leaf completely faded im pretty disappointed of the poor quality to maintain the leaf for longer than a week,0
its nice got compliments but after 2 washes its completely faded and look old,1
i ordered some of these a while back and these are thinner than the old ones i liked the old ones better these dont really show through which is nice,1
good fit,1
i love the feel and the fit of the shorts i have been looking for a while and just about everything i ordered was a miss but these a supper comfortable and it can wear a belt with it,2
the only draw back is i cant get my original band off the screws are very tiny but this band is exactly what i was looking for,2
order size up for size,1
i ride a motorcycle and this cap is great with the silicone band on the front helps keep it in place and sweat never gets in your euo,2
i wanted to like thesethey are very cute and soft unfortunately they were just too wide for my daughters feet and they wouldnt stay on the length fit fine but if your child has wide feet then im sure these would work,1
took a cream colored pacsafe to trip to bali and australia last fall felt secure from would be thieves and it holds many items fits great under airline seats so happy with it bought this blue one,2
for the price i expected this to be a slimming romper like all other spanx,0
little too long but beautiful,2
snap on case came apart,0
i love itthe best gift ive ever recieved,2
i was very impressed with this shirt im 5 7 and i ordered my size a 4x in gray and this fits perfect i dont have extra large upper arm but if i did these sleeves may be a bit tight for me the fit true to sizebr the length is perfect about 30 31 and i wear this with both leggings and jeansbr this is light weight flattering and works great for the office or casualbr its really nice to have another option for plussize clothing,2
when i see the lift fullness of the model with this bra thats what i expect im not little up top so its not like im expecting miracles i found the bra to fit a lot tighter than i wanted it to ordered it to wear at a wedding couldnt im not sure what they are talking about with the foam roll either i looked felt for one maybe im just not seeing itbr i will say that its very prettysexy i thought when i ordered a size up on the ribcage it would be loose but it was still painfully tight cute bra had i gotten 2 sizes bigger it would have workedcup size though was perfect,1
it was way too big underneath the arms,0
tested it on the newer model tenor glasses and did not work,1
so cutebr very longbr super heavy,1
shirt is not at all what is advertised runs very small size up and then some i ordered a m which is my normal size im 57 185 lbs not the least bit flowy very fitting to the skin sleeves are nothing like pictured highly unsatisfied if youre looking for a loose fitting flowy top this is not it deceiving description,0
they are cute but the silver ones tore,0
they say 30f but i worked in 20f at my work and my hands would numb up in about 20 mins of being in their pointless gloves,0
it took awhile to receive but that didnt bother me much its a cheap material and not all that comfortable but what really annoys me is that the picture shows a mauve color but the shirt i received is baby pink thats not what i wanted im considering returning it,1
liked the concept but you could hardly tell is a cat you cant really see the eyesthe eyes are like really at the edge of the earring wish the eyes were more like the picture,1
super soft wish the band was more secure though,2
walked into work after a rainsnow mix day and was slipping every few steps can no longer wear in wet weather should specify they are not nonslip,1
i loved the look of it but didnt realize the band was so hard it wont lay flat like my other watches it is stiff on my wrist but looks good,2
size up material is soft and so comfortable,2
didnt realize it was going to be hard casingbut that ok,2
i have bought a lot of swim suits of this quality and hey are hit or miss this is a miss cheap looking print wayyyy too big bad fabric went back immediately,0
the snap came our of the front cover and is not functioning as described not using it any more,0
i had to return they were just too small for me i wanted them for working outside and they just werent a good fit,1
my son loves the shoes very comfy but they were supposed to come with an insert that allows for normal or wide fit luckily my son prefers the wide fit otherwise we would have returned,1
i was expecting a cotton tshirt material this was shiny and cheap looking with some stretchalmost like a cheap night gown,0
these flip flops have bumps on the inner sole of the shoe which dig into your feet otherwise they fit well,1
runs big its itchy,1
these boots are very comfortable and keep my feet dry i wear them anytime not just when its wet outside,2
customer service was greatbut when i received these absolutely adorable shoes one shoe had been worn or tried on multiple times the strap was all stretched worn the inside was visibly used customer service would of sent another but they were out of my size,0
nice shirt,2
odd fit too small across shoulders and wrist hole the shirt has these seams that are tighter than the rest of the material,0
exactly what i wanted,2
fit is fine heavy tail large hood cute but depends on how much maintenance you want to put into your costume,1
the blouse is ok is warm but the pant is too big and the fabric is different is not warm,1
just not for me it is nice though,0
i just received the bag an hour ago two of the zippered pouches wont close and im gassing off the chemical smell with an electric fan right now of course its not real leather no matter how much they insist otherwisebr but i wasnt expecting that for the price it will still be very handy,1
order a size up from what you think youll need if you want a comfy fit they fit pretty snug on me in my regular size,2
in my experience these run 115 sizes too bigbr br i ordered my usual size 9 and had so much room left at the toe i reordered an 85 and they were still too big br br i gave up bc i didnt want to keep reordering trying to find a size that fits properly,0
i ordered the wrong size to begin with but even large seamed way to small possible this review may be unfair to an extent felt as there is too much material that works against each other looks better in pictures than it is sending them back so i didnt test water resistance,0
the heart on these earrings stick out actually to the back as if they were a second thought it seems to me there was something else there originally and the heart was just a fillin they look very odd,0
earrings are very long but i have long hair so they worked out color is a bit darker than expected but still nice,1
let me tell you about this company they are the best of the best i ordered this bracelet and a set of ear rings from them to wear in our family pictures when i first tried the bracelet on it fit but i wanted it to be a little looser so it could slide up and down my wrist a little bit i decided to write a message to the company to see if i could get an extra clasp or two i wrote the email at 830 on a friday night and got the typical message telling me to allow two business days for a response so i didnt expect to hear back from them until monday at the very earliest i dont know anything about where the company is located or anything but literally less than 10 minutes later i got a lovely response from someone in the company asking for more details clarifying what it is i wanted we exchanged several emails back and forth that night almost like i was texting a friend instead of emailing a company i honestly felt bad for sending them a message so late on a friday night the person i corresponded with was absolutely fantastic first thing that next monday morning they mailed me several clasps free of charge what a great company the jewelry is phenomenal as well the bracelet and the earrings are both a great quality for the price the definitely look more expensive than what i paid for them highly recommend,2
i have wide feet but not big if that makes sense i am not diabetic but thought perhaps these would get me the width i needed which is a challenge with most slippers i wear 95 wide and got a 10 it was too narrow for my pinky toebr in the toe box and too long in length even with tightening the velcro my heels still slid out while walking i think they can be nice if you do not have wide feet may be challenging if you wear half sizes too in my opinion the amount of adjustment you get from the velcro is minimal but may be enough for some people,1
this shawl was pretty but it had a major tendency to shed had to return as it would have made my dark colored evening gown furry,0
nice bra but not much support i usually wear a 38 bc or large this one in l is a bit too loose and doesnt seem to provide support i got one in beige and one in white and both feel the same in terms of support the lower band also rolls up its not wide enough to stay flat,1
these run very very narrow thus did not work for me at all returnedbr br i dont like being required to give this a star rating on a product i did not actually use my feet did not fit one bit,1
the fabric and the pants in general look ok i had to returned because it was very big,2
these are what i was looking for to have variety in colors they do start to pinch the ears after awhile im hoping that they will give a little after being worn,2
the leather part is much duller than the buckle looks off returned,1
the dubly double dd logo is slightly fuzzy instead of crisp of outline the blue color faded on the first laundry washing in cold water all other laundry came out perfectly fine in the same washing causing the shirt to appear almost tiedyedbr br ive purcahsed other cheap shirts from amazon and have not had this issue on any of thembr br very unfortunate especially at 19shirtbr br this is really just a ripoff,0
this was a favorite until i wore it a while it lost its support and i discarded it,2
this bag is awesome feels well built looks great and has plenty of space for your travels,2
the bottom of curved end cuts my wrist at times,0
omg this is the best pajama my baby girl had so far the material is just amazing and she looks too cute in it it feels so warm and comfortable and fits her perfectly i just love this product will buy another one for sure,2
this cap is small for a childs head it seems and the e is not centered on the cap throwing away,0
material was not sweatshirt felt silky,0
after reading the reviews i ordered a medium i usually wear 30 in waist they fit but are really baggy i dont need the button to put therm on i wore them a few days and i should of returned them before wearing hope they shrink a bit after the first wash i measured the inseam and its only 5 but due that they ride low they feel and look longer a day latter they just plan suck going into the recycle bin the seller contacted me and offered to replace the pair with the correct size i ordered a small black pair and the fit real nice very happy with them,1
very breathable keeps your feet dry i wear sockless great product,2
i love oversized sweaters and cardigans and this green color as well but sadly this one didnt work out for me the color and stitching are pretty but it was much too large for me to hold any sort of shape or silhouette also the fabric is quite itchy and uncomfortable this is one of those clothes that i wish i could really like but i dont its so big for me that i dont get those pretty crinkles near the wrists and my fingers only reach an inch or two into the pockets when my arms are straight would recommend sizing down,1
there are a number of things i like about these theyre well made with goodquality fabric stitching and zipper however after taking them on one trip i decided i would get rid of them and replace them with a different brand reason that annoying wide strip of solid color down the center of the mesh makes it really hard to see whats inside it covers most of the surface of the bag and mesh sections on either side of it are too small in comparison also the mesh itself is a texture thats hard to see through because the holes are too small,0
i really like the styling of this watch subdued but sportsoutdoorsoriented its very featurerich with indiglo backlight multiple alarms timersstopwatch etc the buttons are easy to push and large enoughbr br the main disappointment is the way the band is constructed its attachment points are sewn to the watch body two years later the rubberized plastic finally broke and there is no way to replace it with another watch bands it is basically a throwaway watch regardless of the nice features,1
my granddaughter loves them that is all she wants to wear after school,2
it is a gift i hope it fits,1
these are really much cheaper made than i expected large plastic frames and cheap metal do not fit the face well at all and are not adjustable without breaking them absolutely not worth the 999 i spent on them,0
this product runs very large it does not fit the same as the ones that i have purchased at dicks sporting goods buy a size or two smaller,0
i loved it the look on my hand still do but i need to be honest say that the 1st day i wore it the finger ring simply fell off it took some time to do but i finally got it glued back together well have to see how well a long my 34patch job34 lasts,2
very cheaply made unable to even read the wording on the socks very disappointed,0
these boots were terrible they fit fine very cute however the smell is so bad i can not wear them they have been sitting outside since i got them i will never wear them,0
this jacket might be my sons new favorite its a nice slim fit and lightweight material the fabric is soft and it fits well the color is a nice light gray that hides dirt better than white but without being too dark the contrast stitching is a nice touch,2
these socks have alot of bumps inside the sock from like crocheting when you take the socks off there are indentations on your skin they are a little slick when you touch them i will wash them before putting on them on to see if washing them makes them feel better they fit fine but dont like the texture,1
i bought the shoes for the adorable contrasting stripesthey did not come that way the stripes are basically the exact color of the shoes the squeakers are very loud but nice you can remove drove my dogs nuts very disappointed in the appearance as it was not what i expected for the finishing touch to a photo shoot outfit,1
ordered a pair of the dark grey pants for my husband theyre lightweight soft and comfortable sizing is accurate and fits very well i wash dry as instructed and do so without issue he loves the pants and wears them often they really helped when he became sick with covid he wasnt feeling well had fever on and off but they helped keep him cool and comfortablebr br aitfineism mens cotton linen pants are well made good quality and comfortable the price is reasonablebr br recommended,2
returned because of a fit issue too small,1
good product for the,1
the multitoned gift box was very pretty mine was purple with a coating that gave a gradient hue effect there is the led that comes on when you open the box that really makes the moissanite sparklebr br ive always felt moissanites sparkle more than diamonds and way more than most other simulated diamonds so over all very pleased,2
they clip on my regular glasses which are a thick prescription and work great i like that you can flip them up if you want to look at something in natural light,2
these run small they are nice boxers and have a nice feel to thembr i did ask for certain colors and did not get them but oh well,2
i bought two of theseone womens large and one womens small they had little variance between the two sizes and neither one of them fit the recipients i ended up giving them to my 11 year old daughter who still shopswears kids sizes a womens extra small is still typically a bit large on her and they fit her perfectly guess this isnt really womens sizing,0
this skirt is very cute and will look great with mary jane style heels and a button up shirt it fits well but is a little too long for me i am 58 and it comes almost to my ankles it is midcalf in the picture not sure how shorter girls will be able to wear it without rolling the top i plan on rolling it to be midcalf and it looks way better at that length the waistband is not sewn as well as it could be but otherwise the construction is good,1
dont like the plastic feel,1
very nice pendant it looks expensive not cheap it is very small though smaller than i thought it would be but i would still recommend it,2
very comfy and not too heavy for warmer weather,2
husband loves these,2
having purchased similar styles of crocs on line before im really surprised to find that these rubbed the tops of my arches raw after very little walking unfortunately i was out and couldnt change footwear there is nothing noticeably rough on the interior which leads me to wonder if its a chemical reaction giving them 2 stars because of the attractive style but not worth the open wounds they produced this happened a week ago and my feet still show signs of mistreatment had a similar but much less intense experience with a pair id bought previously hope this is not going to be an ongoing problem with crocs,0
the ladies in the family were able to choose the color they preferred and i got to keep one these are very warm and look great,2
cute boots but the odor is so strong i cant stand to have them in the house they will be returned,0
this dress doesnt look like the one pictured it has a weird seam across the breast the color is off and is way bigger than it should be,0
the bra is very pretty you wont have to worry about it slipping down at all it is just what i wanted but it fit very tightly on me i returned it,2
band too large,1
they all broke while putting them on or trying to take them off the sliding pin is very cheap dont waist your time,0
bought these for my girlfriend not only do they fit well but they arent see through which she is always concerned about when at the gym great product,2
ive bought a few barton straps because i like the quality just dont be surprised if they fade over time if thats not important to you this will work nicely and is comfortable,2
rugged nice price nice fit length seesm to be about 15 inch usa to long,1
it was ok while m ft nvr thnkef me or anything the usual nothing special,1
these are for people with extremely skinny feet they are horribly narrow and run very small i wear a size 8 and ordered 89 and my toes were curled up,1
great for using on luggage so it doesnt get destroyed by baggage tosses it also makes it visible to you because it stands out among the others,2
i have bought a different pair of these on amazon from a different seller and theyre so comfortable these do not feel like those theyre kind of hard they almost feel like wearing crocs i shouldve just stuck with the other brand i bought from before but they didnt sell white and this one did my mistake i guess,1
the quality is not the best,0
its beautiful and i love it but the quality is not good the chain is broke after one week wearing have to return,1
i dont know what happened but these are not the same amanda jeans from before i have 3 pr they fit these dont if you are into displaying your butt crack and like the look of leggings gross if you are over 10 yrs these pants will work great the rise in front is higher than the back duh stupid concept i just want jeans that look like jeans not stretch pants they went back,0
dress literally looks nothing like the picture i received a totally different design in a totally different and weird material is not flowy at all as the pics would lead you to believe no i didnt just order the wrong size it just isnt made well at all,0
what i expected and were shipped super quick,2
xl did not fit me and i normally wear a size 810,1
all likes no dislikes this jacket replaced my letterman jacket that i wore in high school my letterman jacket was lost and destroyed after i joined the army in 1978,2
i liked the form fitting ness i disliked how small it was tight it was,1
i filled this up with my necklaces and they are now easily accessible,2
absolutely loved this purse can find no fault in it but would have loved for it to have come with a matching wallet ready to suprise a friend with one now,2
bottom does not flare out like the picture also its more of juniors size,1
warm for winter snow,2
i ordered this in a 2x tall for my son at christmas it fit and looked great when he first put it on but has not done well after being laundered he laundered it according to manufacturers directions but i am very disappointed in the quality and appearance this was not a cheap purchase and i would not recommend,1
less than 24 hours ago i installed the replacement strap on my luminox swiss watch it looked attractive although rather stiff i noticed it was shorter than original band i had some old cabinets to dispose and unfortunately my watch flew with them i am very disappointed that band did not stay closed i actually enjoyed my luminox very much so i am rather upset if you have average or large wrist do not buy ritchie leather strap wish i went with other options,0
its not printed on both sides so i returned it,0
as much as i wanted to love these shoes they are adorable super high quality and are incredibly easy for my 25 year old to put on i had to return them once my son put these on with his smos he couldnt walk up and down stairs i had his physical therapist observe him and she said it was because these shoes went too far up his ankle and were restricting his mobility once he put on a different pair of sneakers he had no problem on the steps so it seems as though she was right i may buy the lower nonhightop version of these shoes in the future because i love how easy they are for my son to put on by himself,1
i was excited to wear this dress at the beach but it looks more like a 1980s granny nightgown vneck is not low as it is shown and described in the product details there are 2 layers of fabric because the top striped layer is somewhat see through the the white 2nd layer is hemmed directly in the frontcenter of the dress not on the side which is how all clothes are hemmed it is 95 polyester 5 spandex cheap feeling fabric looks more like a halloween costume maybe i should be a 1980s granny this year total disappointment i will be returning this item for a refund,0
the shoes looked amazing and were comfortable for a good while once they began to hurt they hurt shoe gels are definitely recommended,1
i love the style of the dress and the look of the dress but the length was way too long and i am 5 8,1
i like the material hated the fit,0
i really like this swimsuit top the bottoms arent a style i like i prefer shorts but the top fits great and is super cute,2
this shirt is terrible it didnt fit at allway too small and it looked like it was made by a 5 year oldthe worst thing i have ever bought online and i only received it in the mail yesterday ordered in novemberbr i will never buy anything like this online again i have learned my lesson the hard way yes it was inexpensive i guess i should have known better also there was no paperwork with it so i cant even return itbr order from this company at your own riskboooooooo,0
the heel height is actually 4 12 inches ouch there is a seam that runs across one of my toes that would be painful if i could actually stand and walk in them so pretty but so ridiculously tall,0
it does get boots and shoes clean it bolted to a surface we have ours right next to the main entrance it is very sturdy hard bristles but way too small we both have small feet and shoes and cannot fit our shoes in it comfortably,1
the hat itself is fine it is a felt material however it arrived squished and is therefore wrinkly and hard to get back into shape it worked ok as a one day prop,1
bigger than my old charge2 but they must have a much smaller battery takes forever to sync info,0
cheap looking gave to niece to play with,1
seemed well made for the price nice color i like that each set bought 2 for christmas gifts for some aquaintances came in its own heavier duty slipcase i appreciate the effort made to present the product in a nice way will have to see how they hold up over time,2
these little sandals are just what i was looking for comfy stylish and affordable i adore them,2
i bought these for comfort to walk around inside at home nothing long distances yes they are soft and squishy but that comes at a cost i always felt off balance it was too bouncy for me the excess movement has caused my heels to crack too i wore them around the house for two months but eventually i couldnt take it anymore they caused me more pain than they were intended to relieve,1
the gitls loved the tops but had to wear a top underneath to keep their belly from showing,2
the shoes fit and are comfy however they are a very poor quality one shoe falls apart after 4 weeks already quite disappointing,0
perfect i have always been jealous of mens wallets fitting in their pants and i love that i can fit all my cards in my wallet in my back pocket great packaging it would make for an awesome present packaged that way ive only had it for a week but it seems sturdy and well madebr br i have been caring this wallet in the back of my pants for a few weeks now and i still very much love the wallet but next time i will get a darker color because my denim has worn on the gray color,2
i suppose their great except these are the kind of gloves that turn inside out when you take your hands out i dont understand why these manufacturers can figure out how to make gloves so that this dosnt happen returning them,0
poor quality and shirts are made small also all the shirts were different in sizes one fit like an extra small one fit like a small and one fit like a medium arm length was also short on all the shirts and didnt even come to my wrist will not ever buy again wasted 30,0
very stiff and rough style is good material not good for a slipper,1
only bought them to stick in my pocket and use while reading labels at the grocery store glad i didnt think i could use them as readers very uncomfortable and fall off easily,1
very thin material,1
pinning the top didnt help fun fabric and comfy but i needed it taken up in the shoulders to even come close to fitting,1
one of my favorite pairs of shorts so comfortable,2
way overpriced comparable to gas station sunglasses very disappointed on the quality,0
i ordered small thinking the fingers will be small but nope they are huge like why you have small if the fingers are longgggg they are soft though i guess i could modify them,1
shirt seemed well made but the sizing was off ordered a xl but it fit like a medium to large,1
so uncomfortable and stiff,0
looks cool,2
so far great suitcase husband travels a lot and has said this suitcase has made it way easier to get around the airport hard shell is also much more protective,2
these shirts were soooo disappointing the fabric is super thin and cheap the shirts before washing are wide and really short this will only get worse with laundering i returned them immediately cute sentiment i just wish these vendors would stop using cheap thin fabric and sewing them in a distorted way,0
this gown is very sexy and comfortable it does not make me hot at night and i am able to sleep without sweating i love it,2
great quality,2
it doesnt match the rose gold on the fit bit,1
whoa this is itchy and verrrry small i have a regular length torso and it was tight im 54 130lbs and it was incredibly small no stretch,0
my husband has purchased probably 6 pairs of flops from this company he loves them my only complaint and his is that i feel they should last longer for the price one year is about the limit after that the soles wear out or the straps break if you wear your flops like an everyday shoe just expect this up your game for the quality olukai,1
extremely comfortable and baggy love the large hoodie fits loosely but shapes to my body fun home outfit material is soft and very stretchy i ordered a large blue and it fits just like i wanted it to i probly could have bought a medium but i have a long torso so the large worked out,1
these jeans look good but the narrow thigh and boot cut bottom give it a pronounced bell bottom look that im not too sure about the rise is much lower than my normal jeans and they will cradle your junk so be aware i like the fading and the material is much softer than your average jean these are meant for casual wear not work i was thinking of sending them back but my wife likes the look so ill keep them and maybe theyll grow on me as i wear them,1
very cheap quality dont buy and very ugly fit,0
its really cute but really large i wear a size 18 pant and it is super big around the waist and i have to tie it around twice if youre maybe like a size 2022 then maybe itll fit but not anyone smaller than an 18 for sure,1
just buy it you wont regret it i bought this as a gift for my mom but my son has been taking it so its pretty much his at this point very plush and comfortable i bought the 3x size and it touches the floor on him his height is 58 and 199 lbs,2
love these earrings they look just like the photo,2
shirt had no buttons on it or any buttonholes,0
fits perfect loves his new look and fits like a 2xlt should fit i have to do more ironing but he looks good and they hold up in a warehouse environment as a lead,2
great tshirt it fits great,2
i love these shoes if you are on your feet a lot then these are for you br im buying more,2
the tag rubs me,0
great quality well designed and manufactured,2
bought for a a samsung watch per the details of the listing the prongs are too long and do not fit into the watch at all,0
great,2
the gel seating is outstanding but size up they run really small,1
i wear a 75 us and ordered a size 7 they fit perfect very comfortable and keep my feet warm,2
very cute colorful and feel quality i ordered a size up after reading reviews and they fit my slim 7 yr old old perfectly,2
doesnt look like the picture at all material is not anything that i would normally wear would send it back but it took a very long time to get delivered itll probably get lost in transit going back for a return,0
maybe it is my figure but it made my waist look weird did not like it on me,0
purchased as a gift for my son in law to wear for their 6th childs baby shower and beyond its super soft nice tshirt material,2
great sock cap,2
these bras are not xxlarge they are more like large cup with a medium band im sending them back very disappointed,0
this ladies sweater by lavidence i gave 3 stars i love the color and style of this sweater but it runs kinda small and is very thin it also has a small amount of pillage already forming under the armpits after only one wear i havent washed it yet and the instructions say it has to be hand washed so thats kind of a downside for me it doesnt appear to be the be the best quality materialsbr i do live in idaho part time and winters can be harsh so i am thinking this is more of a springfall sweater good style pretty color,1
loosefitting does not look as fun as the picture perfect for a thin person or muscular man like my husband,0
it fits great but is transparent be prepared to wear a tank under it,1
ick i dont think i need to say more than 95 polyester it feels icky on and would definitely make me sweat more in the summer heat if theyd choose a nice jersey fabric this would be a great dress,0
i ordered these 2 months ago terrible quality to be falling apart after 2 months ridiculous spend the extra 20 bucks and get better quality,0
i had 2 minor problems with this item is the size there is no smmedlrg option its just hugebr i had to cut the back of the mask down and modify the back so it fit my head medium for most itemsbr i took the material i cut from the back to modify the jaw line the mask is supposed to have a gaunt appearance but due to the size of the mask the mouth area would not naturally cut inward giving the sunken feel that was intendedbr br that being said once i made the modifications to the mask it fit well and looked great once i complete my costume for halloween ill add a pic here my suggestion to the manfacturer is to maybe market this as a onesizefits all and have lines drawn inside to guid folks as to precise location to cut if a smaller the huge head needs to fit inside,1
i like t6he fact that its a cotton stretched which the additional 34flexibility34 to the product but its weird i am not used to having 34free34 ends it feels like it goes up all the time it does not really bother me though it just doesnt have a time for it,2
my husband has been trying to find jeans with smaller legs these fit the requirement without the big billowy boxy look because he requires such a short length it is difficult almost impossible to find jeans which do not need me to alter the length these 28 length are a bit long but i know they will shrink at least 12 inch they fit better through the body than his other brands we plan to purchase 2 more pair,2
i decided to give these pants a try because i love yoga pants when i workout the pants length is perfect for me because im only about 52 fits right below the ankle perfectly i like the way these feel however i dont like the top of the pants they do fit over my waist but they slip when i go for walks because they have no support at the top its just straight with no belly control i dont have a huge belly but i do have a little belly overall i like them but i wish they had more support,1
but cute,1
i bought it for my 20 year old son so he could keep track of time when surfing he loves it super comfortable on his wrist waterproof awesome but the numbers are hard to read in the dark there is a weak light he can see it fine when its dark i cannot but im considerably older and dont have young eyes,2
good,2
my son loves these shoes,2
watch out for what you order i was careful to order by the size chart but it was much too loose for some reason i only got a partial refund upon returning the product wont be ordering much in clothing unless it is guaranteed to be us size could not take a chance to reorderbr anotherbr update thank you amazon i did receive an additional refund to total the original cost quite a pleasant surprise,0
first i will start with the positive the necklace is very cute and i love that the chain is adjustable now for the not so great the earrings do not have any cat ears on them like the necklace does very hard to tell it is a cat it is not like the picture shows the post on one of the earrings was bent but i was able to straighten it i just hope it holds and the backs are super hard to get on,1
extremely thin small and smells horrible straight out of the package foreign seller wouldnt allow me to return it i will never buy from them again,0
i am 53 125 lbs i really wanted to like this but didnt fit my midsection gave me muffin tops looks better on someone with a smaller waistline,1
dress is beautiful i purchased a large body wise it felt comfortable and the material was good but for some reason it was so uncomfortable under and rubbing against my armpits i had to return it,1
wish it had worked,1
dont buy this please i triedto take it off and the rubber part came off but now the metal part is stuck in the watch an almost 200 dollar device now unusavle because i cant put a new band on it,0
the quest for a reasonably comfortable wellfitting wire free bra continues unfortunately after wearing this for half a day i couldnt stand it i tried again a few days later same result going to donate it,0
made from good material,2
im really disappointed in the material of this cute shirt cheap flimsy stuff use a regular cotton tshirt material that will last,0
it was a gift so i do t know what it cost i like it and was surprised to receive something with gaga on it wish is was gold,1
love the hat but was poorly shipped it was smashed really bad,2
only negative is they are all the same color and look alike not like the pictures mine were all blue and white fit is good quality is good,1
cute shorts they fit as expected,2
great product as a gift really loved it,2
theres random white stitching that appears stretched in random spots on these black masks then the circle on one is completely discolored you cant see how bad in pics the light part is very light like white wa slight tint of orange the mask with the face was half black my boys were excited to get these masks and were so disappointed seeing them as was i now i have to go out of my way to return them because they werent inspected as they should have been before packing,0
fits awkward,0
i returned this because i thought it looked cheap in person it is a very shiny silver color which i liked,0
wore out quickly color bleeds if wet,0
i got these to wear around the house theyre generally quite comfortable and wellmade but theyre very heavy my wife jokes that theyre my boots the sole is very thick the price is reasonable though im not sure what the best use case for these is theyre certainly capable of being used outdoors if you have a need for outdoor slipper use i dont though for indoors theyre too heavy for me but im cheap so ill continue to use them rather than buy something to replace them in other words theyre still useable,1
i really wanted to get tieless shoe laces for my husband who has trouble with shoe lace tying i also wanted a pair for my water shoes that constantly come untied i like the laces,1
i have an old pair of flogos that i love this new pair was good but not as nice nor as wide as my old pair i wish they were wider but still fits like a basic flip flop,1
cute purse however i finally got to wore this purse last night and realized there is a huge hole in one of the zipper areas because i put some things in it and couldnt find them this is not cool at all waste of money,0
bought this for a particular event but never got to wear it as the zipper completely fell of the first time i tried to zip it up too late to return it now its just junk sitting in the corner of my closet,0
really thin material can see every line in my bra,1
cute shirt but is is see through and would need to wear a strapless bra,0
love the mask just wrinkles easily and i am usually really good about avoiding wrinkles with my washes,2
love the color and soft material true to size,2
little stretch and didnt fit around the waist that well,1
broke minutes after i put it on,0
great for mix n match for the child who always wants something different not so comfortable to actually wear for an extended time,1
product is very shiny and good quality,2
great gift,2
its a good quality product but its a tee shirt and i was expecting a mock turtleneck that rises a little more on the neck,2
i honestly wish i could review the ears separately i absolutely love these ears they are lace they are super comfortable and super elegant looking i usually cant wear headbands because they hurt my head but this doesnt dig into my head i wore this to a masquerade themed concert back in may i had planned on wearing the mask but honestly the mask is terrifying i had bought it some time in advance so i could make sure it was here in time and it ended up being past the return time so i just threw it away,1
using for everyday casual wear look and feel great,2
fots small but its fine,0
got a gal who loves takis so gifted these to her novelty socks so super fun as a gift theyre thick and warm but not terribly soft perhaps thats the trade off because the fabric has to be printed on the gal has big calves so the socks are tight on her still she loved receiving these,1
too sheer returned it,0
shirt is as described and fits wonderful very nice shirt and i intend to get more material is soft and comfortable and not sheer hemline is as described so i am pleased with the fit,2
great colors they have a lot of thick strings inside slightly smalltight fit the kids well,1
great looks but the shoe keeps getting loose and loose i have worn it about 67 times so far and then after 3rd time i added an insole now its ready for second insole now i ordered 105 and when i had tried 95 it seemed too tight i had no idea this shoe opens that much it took me longer than a month to realize so cannot even exchange it now br br updated review finally after few emails to ecco someone agreed to look at the shoes i shipped these over and they kept shoes for 34 weeks got them back with response we do not guarantee comfort or fitting only workmanship wonder if thats the policy why ask for them and hold them in the first place while i was waiting for this i got some rockport on sale at 10 of the cost love them br br i know this a good company and good quality shoes no doubt hundreds of people cannot be wrong but for fringe situations like mine if a company does not attempt to even solve it its not cool,0
this is just a regular umbrella happens to be clear stay away if you are looking for an actual bubble umbrella,1
pants have odd cut,1
in the picture the shirt appears to be more of a boho shirt however when i opened it from my packaging it looked more christmasy the colors are forest green and bright red i felt like the picture depicted it differently also the arm stitching makes the sleeves very tight its uncomfortable,1
its a little bigger than i expected but gives me room to move around comfortably,2
believe it or not this purse came in an envelope it was so mashed and distorted that there was no way to fix it it looked very cheap also im embarrassed i even bought it i would not recommend,0
they work for the price i guess could probably find about the same quality for the same or less at any flea market or venue with vendors when i lose or break these i may order again unless i find something else before pretty cheaply made and the lenses are very thin feels like they are going to snap when im trying to clean them they dont clean easily at all cheap plastic i suppose takes quite a bit of effort to remove all the smudges the plus to them they keep the sun out of my eyes but thats what they are supposed to do anyway,1
zipper pull broke off 1st time through the airport,0
these are extremely tight get 23 sizes up for comfort fit,1
style not as expected item was returned no refund,0
runs a bit big the material is not stretchy and can look at bit unkempt when wearing it if it does not fit your particular body but i like the color the white detail and looks good with my riding breeches,1
would have given a 4 but didnt get all my color,1
quality made walet love the colors and the purses to match the only thing i find strange is the way the wallet opens it almost seems upside down to me in fact i put all my credit cards in and wondered why when i opened it the lower card holder had all the credit cards were upside down until my sister said that i had the wallet upside down it really does seem that it should be the other way around however its a wonderful wallet and its not a deal breaker,2
the shirt is great and very flattering i do want to purchase a few other colors in this same shirt i love the buttons on the sleeves there were a few random threads on my shirt the shirt was delivered to my house in just a clear zipper bag which i found odd since someone could have stolen it easily,2
one of three had an unfinished leg hole the trimming on both sides had an extra inch and a half that was left hanging very disappointing for this brand the other two are as expected but why are they shipping something out like this,0
came across these shorts while i was shopping for something else the price was low so i put them in my cart but i didnt purchase went back a few days later and they were in my cart for 3 less so i made the purchase they were just as described very happy with them,2
nice my daughter loved them,2
fits great very comfortable but color is much brighter than show pretty disappointing,1
i regret i didnt use it before the return period i only began to use 2 weeks after that and all 3 masks i used so far had the smell of cigarette its so uncomfortable that i had to put the masks in front of my desktop fan and blow air to it to reduce the bad smell i really want my money back now,0
had armpit deodorant marksbr cool fabric returning and ordering again hopefully they get it right next time separate the used ones from new ones,0
very poorly made band rips first time puting them on n separating from underwear them selfs not pleased at all worst thing ive bot on amazon thus far,0
this product is very cute and seems well crafted the legs dont move so i am hoping that means they are less likely to fall off,2
the top of this sock is extremely tight on me i measured and bought a size large but it really digs into my lower calf the foot part is very long and actually covers my toes i wore it for 10 minutes and had to take it off as it was cutting off the circulation in my leg i wont be able to use it,0
quality watch band looks just like it came from the manufacture with the watch but for half the price im tough on my watch and the band in the field and it takes the abuse with no problems highly recommend,2
cute but finger will turn green,1
very comfortable lightweight well constructed great jacket for the spring season,2
i purchased the gloves for my 10 yr old grandson and they tore after one day so not very sturdy product,0
it is a cute cardigan made well but the arms are tight at the top i ordered a size bigger for the flowy kind of look for the fall and it is more like my normal size rather than oversized i have chunky arms and it is tight at the top of that arms and there isnt really a lot of stretch in it over all it is cute though i would say 610 would recommend,1
i purchased an xxl however these are about a us size medium these advertised they are fleece lined and they are not there is no fleece inside the photo shown in the advertisement did not have these huge square pockets on the front which i didnt really care for at all i am stuck with them because i dont live anywhere near a drop off site to return them also they are extremely thin not as described,0
loved this hat it was perfect for my beach vacation and kept all sun off my face and shoulders i have a large head and it was a bit snug but still worked well and was very happy with its large brim and fun style,2
very pretty and stretchy but i needed it to be a bit wider,2
for what it is pending price point i really wanted this to fit correctly and love it but it did notbr br it is what it looks like and in a clean dry light duty environment could be idealbr br i returned it for three reasons and regardless of pricebr 1 my feet are the same size but one was tighter in the width and yes it mattered squishing feel none of my other shoes have this problem unless its the shoe it was the shoe they may otherwise run true size as ive been buying shoes for a long long time now same size foreverbr br 2 additionally the foot opening needs to be either larger or lower rise which would open it up at the foots instep add in that the pull loop on the heel back can not be used you might fit a pencil in the loop whole but not a finger and is to short to grab and pull you have to crush a finger in the band since a shoe horn is useless on this add a lace to that pull hole really no make it functional opening and girthbr br 3 the third reason which just added to it being returned was that there is no insole arch support i use flip flops allot and otherwise do not want to develop flat feet so dont walk around any distance in them this was supposed to address that if even a little bit i can suppose allot like additional insole inserts but why deal with that and would have to be glued in small project if even possible in something like this since such a tight slip on with no real foot opening it would surely ball that insert up in time in my experiencebr br so its a great idea poorly executed in my opinion and again i wish it was not maybe ill see a new and improved banner down the road and at a reasonable price point i will certainly try again if i dobr br if there are folks who like this model asis they could surely as well and nonetheless offer a design that addresses my opinion concerning design and quality issue and at the same price whats the differencebr br i read a comment concerning the void in the sole of the shoe design that void well when i finally got my feet into these that part was not discernable in anyway it was comfortable as far as that goes it was not a negative as far as i could tell and i did consider it in this,1
this isnt very comfortable with the velcro not fitting right the stretch isnt good,0
got it as present and love it just what i expected very comfy,2
tiny,0
its a work shirt and a decent one at that,1
i normally dont write a review but i bought these glasses and thought i would really like them because they are so light weight i wore them once and then decided to wear them again today i put them on and within minutes of driving with them on the lens fell right off into my lap i couldnt believe it i will not purchase again,0
i purchased this 34 bell sleeve dress for my daughter in size medium and for myself in size xl and according to its specs it is very pretty and soft however this dress is too sheer even with the lining and the sleeves run tight i returned both dresses in the same box i received them in let me add that the one i ordered for myself in size xl arrived as a size medium and without any sleeves so i never tried it on i received and email january 16 promising me a refund for only one of the dresses and without mention of the second dress in the box i responded to that right away but have not gotten a reply it is february 7 and i still have not received the refund promised to me in that email dated january 16 three weeks ago,0
super lightweight and soft,2
nice except slight color change on finger if gotten wet,2
so i asked a question in the question section the 5344 woman about 155 lbs size question i went with large and they fit good in the body would not have wanted a medium the leg bands are a wee snug but i am sure after i cycle a month or so my legs will hopefully shrink a tad fit is pretty comfy you know for kinda wearing a diaperlol i dont think i would wear them without shorts over top of them but i can see how some might they fit fine under my loose sweat pants glad i bought the 2 pack so i always have a clean pair to wear no idea how they will hold up in the laundry 4 stars because they are new but i wanted to share size help since we are hitting spring time,2
the skirt is good quality and looks nice i wish i could wear it but i cant i took the tags off or id return it it does not fit to size order a size bigger than you wear it will not 34stretch out34 after wearing it it feels like a rubber band if it were a size bigger id wear it,1
these shoes are well constructed and durable they look good too i would say comfortable but my size 13s fit more like 11s too bad i wish they were better fitting if they were i wouldnt have left them in puerto rico,1
didnt like the fit was wider and not as soft as they say a bit snug in the back,1
i normally wear size 8 and these were too small i ended up giving them to a friend,1
looks better in the pictures,1
very cute,2
my granddaugter loves her new boots they fit perfect,2
cheaply made but they are comfortable will not wear them out for fear of falling apart will not buy again,0
i just dont like the feel of the material scratchy they are well made but not too comfortable,1
the quality is cheap after a few hours of wearing it it rides up and gets really annoying i wont be buying more of these,1
not quite as comfortable as i had hoped although it is a nice sandal,1
love it,2
not a fan looks like it was meant for a woman anyway although the description is mens arms arent long enough either,0
the material is cheap and thin 2xl was like an extra small dont waste your time,0
tight at toebr gives pain on right toe finger after few hours of wearing itbr cannot walk comfortably,1
i bought it in beigefabric is translucent polyester it has a white short inside that look very bad i have to remove it,0
comfortable and breathable material,2
there are so much shoelace lol theyre so long i dont know what to do with them but otherwise shoes are pretty good,2
bought this as a christmas gift for my brother he loved it and so did i now he has to get me one for my birthday next month ha,2
good fit and comfort,1
cute socksquality poor disappointed went by reviewsjust bought themwashed once wore oncea hole already,0
bought as birthday party favors beautiful kids loved them very glittery and the colors were vibrant however one drop and they break in half no effort no rough play they just break two arrived broke,0
great wallet however the money clip broke within the first 4 hours of using the wallet,0
looks great on our daughter minus the fact that they seem to be noticeably too big something well have to grow into i guess the seem to be made well enough to last a while if its something that bothers you be aware that these come with a strong smell that isnt very appealing,2
bought this as a gift its kinda short though,1
wish pocket was a little bigger,1
a gift,1
these rings are amazing i work on farms with heavy machinery and large animals and wearing a metal ring could mean losing a finger these rings are perfect the colors are awesome and they fit perfectly i ordered a size smaller than i normally wear because they do stretch just a bit,2
did not come with a back on time piece so therefore the battery is exposed plus the clock does not work very disappointed because our daughter is a photographer and she wanted this to clip to one of her cases for a show piece and actually use the clock,0
purchased this for my dad as a fathers day gift to replace one that had stopped working great quality very quiet and fantastic price dad was very happy with it,2
decent fitting shorts for running but just a tad too light and revealing for me,1
got my package with the underwear but there is 3 pieces missing out of the box very disappointed,0
used them for cupcake decorations for halloween and everyone loved them great quality for the price and super cute too,2
doesnt work,0
very small but just the right size for a comb money and credit cards nice long strap for cross body i would buy this again,2
great shoe and great price,2
the legs are 15 inches too long will return,0
very cute had a bunch of nice compliments on them,2
pinchers are in great shape the o rings all fell apart but i had spares i just wish they were separated and labeled having to measure them was a hassle,1
fit ok it was really tight on my 12 yr old wrist,1
got this for my boss he loves it the captain go down with ship,2
its very very cute but it came 34undone34 pretty quickly it unraveled,1
i am a true 34c and the size i ordered 34c fit me perfectly this bra is very soft and seamless making it perfect to wear under a tshirt without any lines poking through it gives me a nice shape and its a loose fit so there arent any red marks when i take it off at night i think this will probably last a good 6 months before it starts to loosen which is great also a huge plus for me is the strap length some bras only let you tighten the straps halfway up the back but this one can be tightened as much as you want,2
fabric is very light weightw the smallish fit i returned it,1
a little bigger than i expected but super cute for a wonka themed event got lots of compliments,2
i love this boot its so warm inside and you almost dont even want to wear socks its so soft the sole is much heartier than i expected its not just foam like you get on cheaper boots pleasantly surprised by the quality and fit,2
the burgundy color of this bikini is so rich and flattering against my medium olive skin tone i love it they style of the top is unique and will compliment several different body types well the bottoms actually fit largely which is great i typically dont order bikini sets because im an xss on top and more like a m on the bottom but these bottoms fit like a medium so that was a win for me the only downside was that the breast padding came very wrinkled up and lumpy it did not smooth out so the chest looked really awkward there was no way to remove these pads like normal so i had to make a whole and replace them with others i had other than that lovely bathing suit at a fair price,2
size runs really small and took months to receive product,0
this does run very small i bought a 2x which is my normal size and boy was it tight too tight to really wear another sweater underneath which is necessary where i live i was a little disappointed since i was exchanging another coat for this one,0
these are lovely but as other reviewers mentioned the posts are very long also there is nothing about them being stainless steel on the actual packaging if posts pressing into your skin is an irritation for you skip these,0
love this necklace it looks very elegant and i cant wait to wear it,2
the straps on these sandals were far too tight otherwise it is a cute sandal the cushion seemed to be good but since the straps are not adjustable they had to be returned i found hush puppies blithe to be the perfect mix of cuteness and comfort be sure to check those out returned these and purchase 2 pairs of the hush puppies blithes,0
my only complaint is quality for the cost they tore quite easily if i had spent less on product then quality would not be a complaint comfy and worked well for the shoes i needed them for,1
does not fit well very tight around hips and tummy drapes funny,0
very small and difficult to use,0
i bought these for my sister and she is 4 11 and weighs about 120 lbs nopeshe couldnt pull them up pass her calf,0
for the price it wasnt worth it,0
nice jacket problem for me is the nylon type shell on the camo side is kind of noisy every time you move i will wear it for bird hunting or a camp jacket,1
always reorder this size and style velcro closure helps with my bad hands,2
ordered 2 sizes up bust way too tight buckle at the back broke trying to snap on first try i do like the built in boy shorts,0
all is greatbr good price,2
hat is cute and seems like good quality but it didnt come with the chin strap which i was really disappointed about would have come in handy to have on windy days at the beach,2
one size does not fit all great choice for smaller heads,1
this is a nice and colorful back pack for kids im not sure it is strong enough to last the whole yearonly time will tell the straps are padded and there is a technology pocket that is padded on one side this is a decent pack but seems a bit pricey for a kids pack,2
this is huge this would never fit a child without totally taking over their head it fits my adult head with lots of room i bought for myself since i have thinning hair and need to protect it at all costs it didnt stay on though it is soft and thick with a very elastic band,1
i wish the front twist lock pocket was a zipper pocket same with the back pocket this purse is very pretty but doesnt hold too much before its bulging im also concerned about the quality the front slip pocket came with a large rip in the pocket,1
like the fit top is a little too thick very hot bottoms are too thin can see through them,1
very nice for the price slightly tight fit i am very surprised they were better than i expected,2
too big and cheap material ive seen it cheaper at walmart,2
they fit great at the waist band but it says long legged and they are not they are real short and ride up very easily very uncomfortable because i have to keep readjusting them,0
everything looked exactly as the picture showedthe colors were as i expected them to be i would say this top is more on the lightweightthinner side but not too thin perfect for wearing on warmer days,2
reviewed by my wifebr br i work as an attorney so i own and have owned a great number of blazers over the years in terms of quality this blazer is very wellmade the fabric is highquality welllined and beautifully stitched the gold buttons are shiny but not overly so it is very professionallooking and suitable for both the office and the courtroom it could also be paired with jeans for a more casual look the blazer comes unwrinkled readytowear and on a hangerbr br however the blazer seems made for someone taller with longer limbs i am 55 and the sleeves are awkwardly long to the point that i would need alterations the bottom of the blazer is longer on me than what is pictured on the tall model in sum this is a quality blazer but probably best worn by someone who is taller,1
this button down top is beautiful it fits perfect nice value and price it kind of runs a bit fitted on me but i think it looks quite flattering this top is a bit sheer so you would need to wear some kind of tank top or underneath short sleeve shirt underneath the top otherwise i think you can just get away from just wearing it alone,2
an amazing bag i love how sturdy it is one thing to know is the bag is very rigid and sturdy i have a very rough and tumble life and it has no dents or scuffsbr br one downside just my preference is the strap i did not like the chain strap but i ordered a different strap from amazon worth it because i still love the bagbr br the bag is larger than i expected but for the better i am a larger person and the size is perfect for my proportions i love the tarot motif and the artwork is beyond perfect best present i have ever given myself accessorywise,2
this are nice shoes keen makes a pretty durable show all around this fit true to size theyre pretty heavy in weight theyre well made and decently comfortable,2
lovely dress,2
i purchased this item promptly after seeing how cheap it wasbr br upon receiving the sweater a couple weeks later i noticed that i had received the burgundy colored sweater instead of the coffee colored sweater i promptly filed a claim on amazon about the mistake and the company responded promptly and shipped me the correct color free of charge needless to say i am definitely impressed by their promptness and customer servicebr br the sweater itself is of quite decent quality and it fits me very wellbr br great price great customer service,2
super cute but kind of small wish i had gotten one size bigger,1
very soft material,2
i bought these socks for my dad for fathers day they shipped and arrived quickly dad loves them they fit great and he said they are very comfortable,2
love it i had it for a couple of months and its really in still good shape love it,2
these are very thick and have a slot for an additional filter theyre a little on the large side for my face and have this weird little flap that goes under your chin that makes it even larger otherwise good masks and cool patterns,2
cheap looking,1
strap is too long very annoying other than that bag is perfect,1
quietest and comfortable especially with glasses,2
i took a chance with the reviews being non existent and i shouldve kept my money this was made for a child super short and uncomfortable didnt even go to my hips and i got the biggest size for a loose fit,0
didnt fit over my husbands glasses,0
gave it to a friend and she adores it its pretty and the jewels are still in tact bought it a few months ago,2
these are well made and very comfortable cant say as of now about durability but the look to be okay i will buy more,2
shoe is well built and comfortable to walk in except for the size issue i usually wear a size 11 with no problem this shoe was too short by at least one half size i returned the size 11 and replaced with an 11 12 which fits perfectly,1
my hands have some pain issues from overuse and these earrings were a nightmare to put on it was nearly impossible to open these and at one point i slipped and jammed the earring under my fingernail closing was just as bad with the bonus of one finger with a bloody stabbed nail bed,1
dice cracked in half the second weak of wearing them,0
too heavy empty,1
2xl fit like a medium wont buy this brand again,0
love this shoe feels fairly comfortable nice heel height however it is definitely a nude color not at all the color the stock photo would suggest will hold on to them for springsummer events but would prefer a darker color for fall,2
lil sung in crotch,1
i bought this and they dont really stay on my feet without sliding everywhere in summery all the different strands kind of just clump together if i position my feet and keep them still and position the footwear then yes it looks like the pic but in practical situationsdoesnt look that great,1
i love the bottoms they are a bit small but i can make them work the top is a complete and no go i love the blue color,1
real cute fits well i think they are squat proof i forgot to check because i never planned to wear them outside of the house the ruching is really flattering on the butt,2
i bought the biggest size and it was not a dress but it ended up being a cute shirt so im not too upset i just really wanted it to be a dress,0
really comfy seem to be sturdy i would buy again,2
the top is fine for an extra summer shirt i am 5 9 and it comes to just at the top of my hips there is no way its a tunic or hangs down over my pants i will wear it around the house its very casual and reminds me of the apron tops my mil used to wear soft fabrics and i line dried them,1
the material on this blouse is thick enough so it is not sheer but it drapes like a nice sheer fabric it is very freeflowing and airy it drapes beautifully and is very comfortable it is accurately sized as to the measurements they provided and fits as expected and it feels nice on the skin now its not the softest material available but that material wouldnt look like this it is nice and soft and comfortable just not ultrasoft as to quality this competes with blouses i see in stores it is quite a decent blouse for the price and looks a light higher end because of the added details of the metal accents overall this is five stars,2
much more of a pleated mask than smooth mask as pictured did come with a filter nose wire not so much but i guess you get what you pay for,1
i like it the band is not as substantial as i would have preferred but the watch itself is quite striking,2
i use these as an every day handkerchief if a bench is wet after rain i will wipe it down with a bandana i will blow my nose into one when im stuffy it serves as a heavy duty napkin that adds a bit of panache to my ensemble with color and design that being said they are only one sided and the material is not to my liking in the future i will look for a thicker version of this bandana that has a clear design on both sides i will also only order in packs of colors that i use most often the white lavender teal and purple colors get left in the bottom of the drawer,1
quality and good fitting,2
with arthritis they are hard to get over my headand kindof snug,1
this was not at all what i expected its huge,0
these were a little big but my plan was to put a heel cushion in the back which would have made them perfect unfortunately ive returned thembr br while these shoes were comfortable they made such loud squeaking farting noises with each step they had to go back the noise seems to be from my foot rubbing the bottom of the shoe so perhaps theyre meant to be worn with socks or nylons but i want to wear with bare feet too bad very cute shoes but they need to put fake suede or something else in the bottom of the shoe to eliminate the noise,1
nice colour and comfortable material stretches out after washing,1
nice,2
so i decided to splurge and pay twice what i usually pay for my basic woolrich slippers to get these slippers i got the pink and grey and they really are as cute as the picture however theyre just not durable these didnt even last three months we have fir floors so i wear slippers whenever im in the house and ive had several kinds of woolrich slippers that usually last about a year now i know better than to spend a lot of money for simple slippers,0
keep my neck and ears warm when im out in a cold windy day,2
twisted alot and did not stay in place,1
this shoe is not comfortable or uncomfortable the sole is hardfirm compared to other footbed sandals that i own i like the all black style but the black fabric in the footbed rubs off on my feet making the bottom of my feet look and feel dirty the more that i wear them the softer they seem to get but it is a slow process the leather strap is very stiff and has softened some with wear too,1
the color is exactly as pictured its long im 5 10 and soft love the pockets true to size what i didnt like was collar is sewn backwards like its supposed to be flipped down like a collared shirt but it sits more like a popped collar so it looks off i double checked the photo and its supppsed to be sewn this way i had to return,1
too big for my face returned,0
i ordered a size 8 but seems like 75 not happy with this shoes shoe doesnt have written the size anywhere neither in the box,0
it ran a bit tight for me i had to return otherwise it was incredibly warm,1
feels almost like wearing a weighted blanket i kind of want to live inside of it during the winter months typical great carhartt overbuilt durabilitybr br the inside of the arms is made of a smooth nylon lining as opposed to the soft fuzzy fleece you might expect i understand why they did this because this is meant to be a work jacket and this smooth lining allows for maximum arm movement and flexibility over the course of a long work daybr br still i enjoy it even as something to wear around the house in the winter even though i dont exactly use it as a work jacket for anything more rugged than dog walks and the occasional snow shoveling excursionbr br as with all carhartt sweatshirts ive owned the color will fade somewhat after washing even if you take care to wash it with woolite for dark clothes this is not a problem in my eyes because imho this is work gear and doesnt need to look pristine like jeans you want it to look a bit lived in,2
i like the design but sizing while wearable is a bit tight at the top putting on taking off the socks takes some pulling and tagging,1
poor condition,0
so it fit fine then shrunk up and now i have to wear leggings with it kinda sad cause i really liked it,0
good uke strap like it a lot,2
these shoes are so cute i just wish they didnt make my sons feet stink so bad still love them though,2
the back of the earrings will not stay onbr had to return it,0
i have worn the pink band for about 23 weeks now and it has turned color around the edges and on the band so it looks dirty i have tried several things to clean it with no success also the bands are not as pliable as the original fitbit brand but for the price that isnt a huge issue,1
even if this is a costume wig the photo is impressive and the real thing is not the product i received was snow white like a santa beard or angel hair like the kind you throw on your christmas tree it did not match the platinum blond like the photobr br additionally the bands of the weft can easily be seen which to me make the whole thing look very fake and unappealing you are better off getting a wig called incognito by forever young which has a very platinum color rich and thick layers of hair and will not have the unsightly wefting bands show throughbr br the amazon store i purchased mine from wanted to charge me a 20 restocking fee block buster costumes even after i explained the problems in addition the company did not want to pay for the return shipping thank goodness amazon is there to help i will be working this return over the next few days hopefully i can get my money backbr br update 92513 the block buster costume would not work with amazons customer satisfaction policy they sent me an email and they want me to return the item my cost and then they will see if i should get a refund they would also not give me return shipping rma or anything and said that a refund was not promised i did not wear the wig and i think they might think i wore the cheap thing and then want to return it but that is not the case just looking at it in my hand at arms length i could tell the thing was so cheaply and poorly made i certainly would not wan that thing on my head if i returned the wig paid for shipping and if i got charged a 20 restocking fee i would have paid out extra with no guarantee and no product in my hand block buster costumes has it rigged in their favor with no guarantee and definitely no concern for customer satisfaction,0
used these as a girl scout troop gift i ironed on felt letters without any issues really great value would purchase again,2
the armholes have a weird fit and the shirt itself is very boxy its not flattering at all for anyone who has an hourglass or pear shaped body darts or pulling in the side seams in a curve would have benefited this shirt its not see through but its really not worth itbr br i cant recommend this shirt,1
ball already broke off but nice and soft on the inside and a good skinny fit,1
nice handbag,2
came broken and with the wrong stone color,1
really too small based on measurement,0
these get all fuzzy even before the first washing they are very slick on wooden floors dont keep my feet warm and dont breathe very well keeping my feet hot and sweaty sometimes but not warm they do not feel comfortable in my boots,0
theyre cute but they both broke the first day i wore them and i was sent the wrong onesi did not receive what was pictured,0
very very very large,0
i usually wear a 6 12 b i ordered these shoes and the toe box peep toe is snug now will it stretch out i just dont know the ankle strap is comfortable probably will return for a larger size or possibly wider i doubt the 7 would fit,1
loved the fit,2
nice for walking active shoe,2
belt loop on bottom of jacket is torn,1
fit really weird,1
i tried this spray on 3 different hats following the instructions precisely i sweat right through all 3 of them as though the product changed nothing outside of making my hats smell like a chemical spill,0
the shirt i got actually looks like it is shrunk short and small it looks to be a size small or a medium even though i ordered and it is tagged extralarge not even close i bought it as a gift and gave it to her embarrassed knowing it would be too small maybe she can wear it like a tight tank tee would fit under other clothing as in when you want to layer otherwise it is useless unless you want to turn it into a pillow or cleaning rags or something,0
this bra runs tiny in the cups im always a dd and this one i was popping out on the sides and top returning to amazon because they dont make a ddd cup,1
gave the item as a gift and they loved the color and how warm they were,2
it is ok but it doesnt look good on me dont know that is the shirts fault,1
disappointed in the value for the price theyre more like a 899 sandal,1
first time using socks and the pink pair has this big hole in them,0
flattering comfortable,2
it is bigger than i thought but it is nice,1
just right for messes outside i can spray them off with the hose,2
i love this jacket its perfect for those chilly mornings where you need something lighter than your winter coat and more than a light jacket i love the diagonly zip and snug fit it would be nice if it were a little longer but overall well worth the money,2
i asked for these as a gift i thought they looked so cute i got the blackpeach ones at first glance they were a little shinier than i expected from the photos they definitely have that spandex look which i didnt really see in the photos they are also a little short in the ankle for me my inseam is about 29 inches and these leggings stop at 27ishbr br also worst of all the leggings are seethrough if you bend over especially noticeable if you wear full underwear not cool considering the over all quality is topnotch as expected from puma everything besides the transparency is perfect from the stitching to the higher waist and im so sad they didnt work out,1
the bottom to hard,1
i was skeptical buying these from the start because the sizing seemed weird to me but i figured i could just return them if they didnt work they fit super loose on the top of the foot and were definitely too long i also bought these expecting more of a squishy cloudlike feeling but they were pretty much just hard rubber,0
i love this dress fits perfectly i received so many compliments at church ladies this dress is different and deserves a five star rating,2
i ordered a 3 pack of these last year in xxl and love them wouldnt say they were an xxl but read the reviews on fit so ordered up just received another 3 pack in xxl and theyre smaller then what i had and thought would be getting the same of,0
im 50 120lbs this was a big large on me it looked cute off the shoulder but if i moved my arms around the shoulders popped up and then it was around my neck this might be ok for pool time kind of moomoo ish,1
i purchased the green shirt color was a nice vivid green unfortunately shirt was very small i am 54 and weight 145lbs i usually wear medium shirts i bought a medium very very tight couldnt even move my arms i will need to buy an extra large for the shirt to fit me comfortably,1
the only feature i wish the watch had is a way to see the time in the dark,2
was a gift and is well loved comfy,2
its a beautiful scarf its just not silk very disappointed that it said silk in the order information and then when i received it its polyester,1
i like this top but it definitely runs small i ordered a size large and its a big snug on me im a 36b for reference it is basically a cami with a built in shelf bra that has removable padding i found the padding to be flimsy and didnt retain its shape very well so i replaced it with some i already had and i like it better that way it is otherwise comfortable and i like it,1
i am 51 my legs are short have hard time finding jeans leggings fit tight in right places n bagging in wrong places these were baggy in lot places not good fit for me sadly,1
this is a nice quality top but didnt realize it fits tight almost like a rashguard if you are looking for a fitted athletic tee this is great,2
092616br bought when they were 34prime34br nice fit got the 44 because i did the cm measuring came up with 265 so i followed the chart i wore a 44 giro wear 11 nike 95 nb casual dress shoe i am happy i could get the whiteblack looks sharp i was surprised that the tongue is padded the straps are a little long using spd 2 hole cleats that went on just fine may need to adjust them but i will know more with use these shoes fit well i will see how easy these are to clean updates to follow if neededbr 092716br i did change the bolt locations of the 2 bolt cleats from the front pair to the rear pair of threaded holes for comfortbr 110416br i have noticed while riding on my spinner because of the weather for the past 5 weeks that the tongue of both shoes migrate to the lateral outer side of the shoe after riding for a time this is annoying but not uncomfortable i dont know what can be done ive had the straps as tight as i should i even tried holding the tongue to the medial inner side of the shoe but to no avail this is why i am dropping my rating from 5 to 3 i was thinking of putting some velcro on the tongue but i dont think the adhesive on the velcro loops or hooks would stay,1
excellent product easy to install,2
i personally like to walk for 1530 minutes during lunch at work its not flashy as i do not want to attract too much attentionbr it feels very comfortable i bought half size bigger than my normal size and it turned out to be a bit loosebr so i guess its safe to buy your regular sizebr definitely a great comfort shoebr br i save best for lastbr this is the ugliest pair of shoe i have on my shelf it will not match with anything,1
beautiful look much more expensive than it is,2
these are great shoes that are very comfortable and affordable,2
pants tore when tightening strings,0
the first time i ordered from this brand the pants were great they were well made not see through stretchy cotton leggings for daily wear which is exactly what i was looking for after losing some weight i ordered another pair in the next size down completely different material they were the shiny smooth material usually seen used for high intensity workout clothing no big deal i just use them for running instead of casual wear saw these with the side pockets and thought hey a place for my phone and keys would be nice for running and hiking completely different material again not cottony for casual wear not the workout material just i dont even know everything sticks to it cat hair lint dust its kind of rough on the outside but completely wearable still soft on the inside the side pocket design seems to run a little smaller but not uncomfortably so they also seem to trap heat like theyre just so hot i dont know im really happy with the fit and durability of everything ive gotten so far id just like to know what type of pant fabric im going to receive consistency mattersbr br just for clarity all the leggings ive ordered have been solid black different material every time,1
this on i returned sewn wird too large fabric is beautiful,1
i tried this show to see how this would work with racquet ball it seems little tight at the beginning it is only a week thatbr i have been using for i will provide an update in a month or so on the fit the first week seems ok to me and is a good fit i always struggle regular shoes with small toe area,2
nice shirt,2
payed a merger 10 bucks for these and wouldnt do it again i have other hodgson shades and theyre ok these are flimsy and heavy these are bolle 6th sense knockoffs i wanted them for cycling these wont make the kit rotation,0
i like the size color and material,2
been riding hard for months now these glasses stay on your face and no wind tears love em,2
a little too spendy but i like them i like being able to connect to the earth and feel the stones beneath my feet as i walk through the woods,2
i ordered this necklace because i thought it would look good with my prom dress it came in packaging that had to be ripped to see the necklace and once ripped it can not be returned the necklace is significantly longer than the photo made me think it would be now i can not wear it with my dress and i can not return it which is a big bummer,0
rips very easy,1
this is a cute leather bag to hold your phone and some credit cards or cash you can fit a key or fob but nothing bulky it has several slots to keep things organized and from falling out,2
these wear really well i would love to see them in a nylonspandex blend this is a cottonspandex blend for exercise the nylon breathes better but i wear them often and they fit well,2
beautifully made watch case packaged perfectly to make sure no damage came to it the little pillows for the watches are great this wont hold very large faced watches but sure does hold a variety love it recommend for a gift or for yourself,2
nice material not too thick or thinbr did not realize it has real buttons assumed they were for looks large button openings means gapsbr runs small i normally wear a large and bought an xlarge because of reviews its still a little tighter than i would like,1
the shoes showed crease marks almost as soon as i started to wear them looking for new shoes only a couple of months in had bought these in brown as well and same issue,0
nothing fabulous,1
the waist stash itself is nice i will use it but it does not do rfid protection tested it i put my work entry card into the waist stash and it read the card i then lined the stash with aluminum foil and it wasnt able to read it so solution for me is i will line it with foil it is comfortable and i do think it is necessary for my travel fits my credit cards passport and money easily and slips into the top of my pants i also purchased the neck stash but i dont think i like that one i can at least access the waist one if im sitting at a table,1
nice item good quality but white material had pink hue,1
not very comfortable,1
this is incredibly overpriced in fact the only thing that distinguishes this from ldurian gifts other interlocking circles pendants is the cheaply printed mother daughter card the description says the circles are engraved but thats not the case nothing special and certainly not gift worthy,0
they are just what i needed for work,2
this shirts is actually like the picture but it runs small if you are hoping to get it to maybe cover a larger stomach like i have order a size up it may fit you well across the top or for me to big in shoulders,1
i consider this to a a unisex bracelet it is comfortable and nice looking the price was also very reasonbr able,2
this was a christmas gift and the recipient liked it,2
it is a wonderful product and as expected,2
this body suit had a cute shape to it but it was a little see through,1
it is perfect need to go up 1 size as silicone rings have a tighter fit,2
cute socks but no holding power too big and baggy,0
decent quality but very tight fit fit is typical for chinese brand shirts but much smaller than american xxl,1
bought as a replacement pair for my mother who loved these flip flops until the rescue pup got a hold of them she is so very happy and loves these flip flops,2
fit runs little large and quality of fabric poor,1
i really wanted to love this dress but i had to return itbr br prosbr its beautifulbr perfect brunchsummer dressbr material is perfect for summerspringbr probably looks good with sandals and heelsbr br consbr fits baggy at the chest i am a 34bbr bending down was going to be a nightmare because it was a bit short on the butt i am 51br it is made of incredibly thin material that renders the dress fairly seethrough despite being lined i wouldve had to use a skirt slip or something which i do not have and wouldve had to purchase separately buying the slip for the sake of keeping this dress wouldve made the dress no longer worth the moneybr br if you have a skirt slip this is the dress for you,1
it was too long if it was a little shorter i would have liked it better,1
awesome great looking packing was well doneperfect for a gift,2
new balance has changed the lasts for their shoes most are too narrow now,0
i am a senior citizen who is currently experiencing restricted movement this is a godsend on days when i am stiff and sore i can put my shoes on with ease,0
the customer service is great as they gave me credit for the wrong glasses shipped the glasses on the other had are awful and the accessories cant manage to save it from a one star rating the optics on the glasses make everything yellowish and blurry the micro cloth that comes with it is like rubber and the case zipper broke after a few times if you want to buy cheep glasses that cool but dont buy these ones have had better for cheaper,0
muy chiquita incluso para mi niña de 2 años,0
these are cute and color is true to the image they are more like trouser socks than they are plain old regular socks and they are really small in the leg the person i bought them for wears a womens 7 shoe and a 6 petite jeans in other words perfectly normal sized she cant pull them up all the way because they only go a small ways past her ankle the foot size is fine but the legs are what youd expect to find on an 1012 year olds sock disappointed,0
we unfortunately had to return these because they are not slip resistant which is our reason for buying thembr other than not being slip resistant they are good looking comfortable and would have made a nice pair of work boots but without the slip resistant material theyre not worth keeping in our case,1
the zipper is too short it is difficult to get on and off,0
need instructions in english,0
the zipper gets stuck a lot and there isnt much room for cash,1
all of the items are different colors you may get away with wearing the earrings and bracelet as set but definitely not all especially the hat and necklace but to be totally honest i do like the set im just disappointed that they are all mixed matched,0
nice thick hat does a great job of keeping your head warm doesnt make your head itch like some hats,2
really cute but really over priced,1
sizing was small material was not soft it was scratching i returned best part about amazon returns are accepted and easy if you arent happy with the product,0
i measured per instructions and came out as 36c the cup size was about like a teacup on me way too small i have to return them afraid to try another size so will go elsewhere,0
it was broken,0
a little short,1
the shirt looks very low quality i guess i got what i paid for,0
a very bad quality not like the picture dont waste your money,0
super tight its almost to uncomfortable to wear,1
comfortable and cute great value,2
i think its cute but honestly besides the price which is expensive amazon should take this off their site because of danger risk you can not breath in this costume for more than 5 minutes again cute costume but extremely dangerous,0
runs big,1
this is cute but please be aware it is small,1
i bought these because they looked so good in pictures i was skeptical because the price might have been too good to be true but nope they are just as pretty in person they come with a very nice case that protects them well i use these and the other pair i bought as well all the time the other pair are in a different color which i call gold but thats not the term the company uses i have forgotten that i highly recommend if you are into larger glasses with bling,2
damaged 8tem has a stain on it,0
the material was a cheap shiney material but the cut was cute however the seams were not good and a white seam on a black section at my bust line makes it unwearable for me not good quality,0
nice fit well and keep feet warm nice non slip bottoms,2
the bracelet is nice but it falls off my husbands wrist easily it needs a better clasp,1
not that its too small or too large but they just want to ride down your backside i dont think my coworkers want to see my rear end playing peek a boo otherwise theyre comfortable and the fit may just be because i have kind of flat booty,1
the style is absolutely gorgeous and the print looks exactly as it did online however one of the folds on the breastline was not finishedthe edges were frayed and not sown,0
it came in to small the side only goes to the tip of my ears so its like its just balancing on my ear so sad because its a really nice durable glasses,1
my granddaughter loves these boots they are exact purple look great,2
great,2
looks good,1
beautiful,2
looks nothing like the picture and fit nothing like the picture maybe you have to order up 2 sizes for that look will be returning,0
it was not teal it was navy blue and so heavy,0
beautiful earrings but very fluffy they dont hang sleek at all big puff balls not very happy w the product but they are very pretty not a fan of the way they hang but each to their own,1
lots of places to help keep things organized and easier to get to,2
fabric chinsey poor quality liked color and fit,1
received before expected date works very well,2
i think i am going to keep the shirt because the style is super cute but it is very see through the material is like stretched out medical gauze that is the best way that i can describe it size shorter than i expected but otherwise runs large i really wish i could find this exact style in a different material i ordered the white,0
it looks better on the model it is a bit firm fitting but i like that it comes in a longer length mine arrived with a yarn already out of place so youll have to be careful as this sweater snags easily i like a lot of the other sweaters the company has to offer as theyre more solid,1
very disappointed not as expected,0
i returned this watch it was way too thick and heavy and im no small man as far as quality im not sure i took it out and tried it on then returned it,0
a little biggerlonger than i wanted but works,1
i ordered this shirt in a small because i read the reviews and wanted a more compressed fit perfect i wear it under my waist trainer to absorb the sweat it definitely absorbed moisture and the material was soft definitely would recommend and would buy more when these need to be replaced,2
soft a little tight at the top of the calf,2
did not stretch at ll they were very uncomfortable shoes just telling it like it is,0
read the product description carefully this strap only works with certain types of glass with a hole this did not work for my sons glasses and i had to return,0
a piece of junk i thought it would be a nice gift but its just a piece of plastic,0
wow first of all 1000 not considered to be cheap for this kind of cami not worth ten dollars color is not white it has reddish pick look in it i do not recommend this product from these sellers not white i am sadly disappointed and it is tight and not like normal camis will not buy again,0
fit a little bit small but it was great quality looked so cute on our baby,2
overall a good quality robe i wish it was thicker but it does the job good buy,2
gorgeoussparkling stones looks real and great for a gift,2
beautiful more beautiful in person fits well,2
i wore these for pittsburgh winters ive had them for a season and they are really nice to wear and they look cute in an odd kind of way really hardy shoes,2
quality was good on initial inspection but i never installed them bronze brown does not mean bronze reflective lens with brown tint like oakley defines it the lenses were just brown with no reflective properties returned for refund but will be buying another set for my square wiskers,1
i have been unable to find these in my size the last 6 months so i was thrilled to find them in stock and absolutely ecstatic that they were almost half of what they usually are i had been paying over 80 for my leather tretorn nylites,2
pésimo producto regale mi dinero todo lo tire a la basura,0
thought too small,1
good looking product but tricky to charge and lights stop working a week later not really worth the money we pay for them advice dont buy them of you expect a long lasting product,0
ordered an extra large fits my friends six year old,0
the bracelets are fun but the designs and colors are not like the lilly and laura originals i would suggest making more neauteal colored bead bracelts the braclets are sturdy though and hold up well good for the price,1
the slipper fit well but we ended up returning it due to it being too much padding on the sole it seemed like 34 inch padding and my son wouldnt even walk i the slippers defeated the purpose of having them fast delivery other than that and the seller was very nice and helped me return them right away,0
cute jeans but huge i read the other reviews and ordered a size down and they still dont fit right i dont think theyre for curvy girls the hips arent too bad but the knees and lower legs are huge and baggy,1
the print is 1 side not both sides then it ws dark blue on back then scarf darker then shown i bought a lighter color what i got cause they reduced it maybe it had no tag was like a art project we all know scarves usually have same print both sides this was awful but i just kept instead of mailing back but nothappy with and havent even used it so far,0
all nykon,1
i wear size small but purchased medium tops i hadnt washed the tops yet i think they might shrink looks nice with leggings the one time i wore it,1
las medias muy bonitas y cómodas pero un par rota,0
the product shipped from india and took weeks to arrivebr it does work well and helps shine up the shoes after walking in the salty snow low rating for shipping not for product,1
thinnest fabric ive ever seen in a tank top keeping because i really need a white tank now would not buy again,1
daughter loves it,2
first pair opened was cut incorrectly with a large chunk missing leaving them unwearable,1
i was looking for something to help keep my clothes more organized in my suitcase nothing is more annoying than when you pack your suitcase perfectly and everything gets all shifted around by the time you arrive to your destination i recently went to florida so i had a lot to pack i ended up using the largest cube in the bottom of my 22 carry on suitcase it fit perfectly there was even a gap around the edges between the cube and my suitcase where i put skinny items like my hairbrush and flip flop sandals i ended up not using the smaller cubes just because my suitcase had a built in cube zipper in the top my family is traveling a lot this year so this will be perfect to keep all my things perfectly organized i also like how the cubes have a mesh side to allow air to circulate i got the blue color and it is a nice sapphire blue i would definitely recommend these packing cubes,2
well built shoe very sharp looking too,2
item was one size fits all however it did not fit me,0
cant close them at all my ears are raw and red and i was only to get 2 out of 6 of them to successfully close while in my ear never been so unsatisfied about a product less than 10,0
i was super disappointed when i opened this it looks nothing like the picture and looks super cheap i will not wear it and wish i had sent it back,0
love the shirts very cool for work bought two a gray one and a red one the gray one fits perfect just like an old one i had of this style the red one is too big i believe it was marked as the wrong size dont wear that one,1
not what i expected at all,0
this is a beautiful skirt but small due to this returning,0
i usually wear an 8 12 but these come only in whole sizes so i ordered a 9 the fit is very snug hard to get on i will be returning them as they are not comfortable,1
i have a long torso this was disappointing could have done something else with that money the waist trainer not fit just like the rest of them i am 58 and about 45 inches in my waist,0
this ring is very nice i was looking for a colorful and yet thin ring and this serves that purpose i look forward to the stainless steel to be very durable,2
wallet is starting to break after a while had held up since then but im disappointed is hasnt lasted longer,0
shorts run small long wait to receive them over a month,1
pilled up a lot and faded after washing,0
luckily i read the reviews before ordering this for my husband and ordered a larger size than i otherwise would have i gave him one after we were first married when we really set our thermostat low to save money its an authentic irish night shirt the real deal its a little bit scratchy but nothing that a little fabric softener cant fix and its incredibly warm,2
when i purchased this blouse i was very excited i love button down tops and im a larger breasted woman i received it very well packaged i was super excited to try it on i ordered a size larger than my usual size it fit but barely it isnt true to its size it buttoned down but it was extremely tight the only way i will be able to wear this top is completely unbuttoned with a cami underneath its a beautiful top it fits fine in the arms and i am very tall it has decent length my best advice is order a size or two larger than what you wear it has good potential and it will look nice but the only way that will work is for you to order much larger than your actual size having larger breasts will make it almost impossible to button down i rarely ever have a bad review but i was pretty disappointedbr i bought this product for a discounted price in return for my honest unbiased opinion this is my honest review of the product i would like any one considering purchasing this product to have enough confidence in my opinion to make an informed decision on if this product is a good choice for you if youve found my review helpful please click the button that says helpful to leave me some feedback,1
used daily a couple pairs of these have had expedited cracking in the soles allowing water to seep in i like the shoes but want something longer lasting i am trying another ecco shoe will see how it goes,1
doesnt accommodate heads above 75 well though big heads should be smart enough to read and look elsewhere not me though,1
i am very disappointed with this product used a few times as shown in picture still has the tag and already wiggles also i was just trying to close it and a needlesharp metal went in my thumb too scary to think of using it again not a safe product as it is manufactured poorly with cheap materialsbr update i was just able to take out the piece of needlesharp metal from the umbrella handle that went under my thumb skin a few days ago this product is not safe to use,0
very pleased with this purchase,2
started falling apart the first time i washed them material clings to your body when you sweat they are cute but these issues make them not wearable,0
this is an absolutely gorgeous dress it looks just like the photos and is nice quality my only problem is that when i received my order the invisible zipper was broken on the back i ended up having to send it back and unfortunately a replacement wouldnt arrive in time for my event disappointed,1
great value,2
ordered these masks due to the ongoing covid situationthese masks are of very good qualitythey fit well and look greatas recommended by cdc 3 layersand the price is great for the quality you get,2
pretty sweater but very thin short and runs small i went up to a from my usual small to medium and i regret not ordering a large i am 56 125 with a 36 inch bust slender arms this would work better for summer nights than a cold weather garment its not very warm like other reviewers mentioned the only thing i could wear under it without looking bulky is a tank topcamisole,1
the lining is so incredibly short that my behind hangs out not wearable at all the cold shoulder sleeves arent as flowy as the picture taking back,0
bigger then expected,1
wrong color sent fits fine and decent quality,1
pleasantly surprised with this purchase not too thin like some of the stuff today and not sweaterthick 61 and 205 lbs and xl was perfect for me a touch big just like i like it,2
size runs a bit small also the suede stains badly not recommended wish i had not worn them and sent them back i like some of the other sketchers shoes,0
finally received my order just to see that it is clearly missing buttons,1
i love these masks so much that i ordered them again and my daughter stole them im going to need more,2
very pretty scarf but a little small,1
got this for my father as a gift he is on the smaller end of the medium size in general i got this and while it fits across his shoulders it weirdly went tight around the hips he is super skinny 160lb and 6ft tall and doesnt have big hips or anything its just a strange fit he had to keep it as he is leaving the country and no time to return will probably try and stretch it out at the bottom regarding quality as others have said the quality is not the greatest for the price at all it is what you would find at walmart type quality and nothing more even the print of the logo could be better still it is all i can find with this logo on if id known i would not have bought this and would have returned it if i was able to,0
they are very delicate i thought they would be bigger but its ok,1
it doesnt look how it does in the picture its one long skinny strap that you are supposed to wrap around yourself rather then an adjustable clasp in the back i usually use it in other ways since it wont wrap over my waist properly material is good the metal circle is smaller then depicted chains dont look how they do in the picture but i still appreciate them because they are removable so i like to use them on other pieces or attach them to collars im wearing lol,0
got this as a gift for my son after watching the englanduruguay game he likes it so far,2
didnt like no padding,0
this is the 2nd one ive ordered and the material is different than the first this was is more tshirt like and the zipper is whitenot the same color as the top so it stands out when unzippedbr sleeves are also slightly shorter than the first one so not sure about consistency,2
this wig is awkward fitting it falls off of my 4 yo daughters head the hair pulls out easily i see it falling apart very soon and i just bought it a few days ago if you will use it for a costume and not regular usesure get it bc its cheap if youre getting it for continuous dress up use for a young childopt for a better one,0
very cheap looking,0
rarely do i give any watch strap a 5 star rating but this was clearly the exception i needed a rubber strap for my bicycle riding watch this strap fits great and is longer than most standard straps it stays in place and is easy to clean so far it has held up well on my daily bike riding watch,2
beautiful shoe great quality fits well as described and very comfortable as described in photo,2
unlike other 34no show34 socks these perform as promised even in lower cut shows like chuck taylors however they are super thin and tended to wear out quickly i got what i paid for in that sense three stars for being odorfree thanks to the bamboo fibers,1
a little on the light on the weight but nice belt if you like the look buy it,2
highly recommend these belts i now have three and enjoy each one,2
great addition to my vintage style wardrobe this petticoat hits right below the knee which is the perfect length for most of my skirtsdresses,2
this is a lovely dress i wore it to church and received a lots of compliments,2
shirt is very thin not what i expected,1
lots of material pretty but looks like a mumu on,1
did not stretch and the large size was basically a small,0
love it fits my wrist nicely and isnt too big and bulky very light i got the white with the blue accent colors and it is a beautiful color,2
my boss loved this and thought it was hilarious,2
me quedo muy bien y luce mucho además super comoda lo uso casual,2
i bought a 2x and it was way to short everything else was big enough as it runs small but the length barely made it to the top of my jeans returned it immediately very sad,0
very large i sent it back because it was just bigger than i like,1
im absolutely loving this dress fits amazing and looks super classy,2
too big if you have a small wrist and its impossible to make it smaller,0
its not the same as the picture its very blue in the edges its much more like the second picture,0
not a good fit for me gave it away,1
color is off i thought it was cotton or had some cotton in it it doesnt i dont like it for me,1
i own five pairs of these leggings and they fit and feel great ive worn them for pilates tennis strength training classes and they hold up really well i wish they come up with more coloursprints the fabric is so soft and feels great on your skin its relatively high waist enough to cover and not make breathing uncomfortable the fit guide is accurate,2
it fits fine however when i wear it i sound like a trash bag every movement can be heard the outside material feels cheap,0
i ordered my usual size and they fit at first after 2 weeks they are so stretched out i walk right out of them its dangerous to wear them because im disabled and might fall they dont look nearly as nice as the picture ps i only got 700 refund plus a complimentary 700 from amazon,0
magnets are not strong enough and earrings fall off,0
wow really designer looking very stylish,2
super sexy swimsuit fits very well and keeps everything in place,2
these headbands are adorable and were a big hit in the christmas eve gift boxes i put together with pajamas and a book,2
unusable due to the wire being disconnected from the contact,0
liked the shoe but too tight,1
made it work cut out legs left as a long pj shirt i am short so was too tall for me but made it work,1
legs were far too short vneck too low returned,0
colors looked different on the website i thought it was black on the bottom its brown a little disappointed,1
i bought this ring to size down my engagement ring with the knowledge that it would be replaced by a real one when i got married overall i like the look of it and it works nicely with my 3 stone ring but i only had it for about a week before a stone fell out it is quite noticeable not that this ring is overly expensive but i still feel that stones should not fall out that quickly i have not contacted the seller as i dont feel it is worth the hassle and it will be replaced anyway but if someone is looking for something that will be long lasting i would keep looking,1
perfect fit other than being a bit long,2
if you are on the fence as to size round down i have ordered these exact shirts from another location for nearly twice the price and round them here they are exactly the same but the large from there was slightly bigger than the large from the other place i am about 57 and weigh 180 lb the other reviewers are correct about the huge size the medium was a much better fit than the large i ordered one of each i will order more but will stick with the mediums,2
i like the material its stretchy i like the side pockets these are cute,0
the short sleep top works great as a lab jacket when paired with an under shirt,2
it only came with 3 not 6,0
so pretty but the chest and shoulder areas are very wide and large,1
the shirt is nice material but doesnt fit quiet the way its shown sleeves are longer just doesnt lay right on me,1
a little short but next size to big,1
love the softness and fit,2
cute but a little see through,2
cute and seems well made but they were too small for my big bottom,1
broke after only 5 days,0
its okay but i ended up buying a little wider set of 3 silicon bands and they looks a lot better good thing these bands are affordable,1
super small,0
great dress for the price fit as expected and washed very nicely i will be ordering more colors,2
not impressed about the quality but because they are underwear and probably not very good to return so i just kept them,0
i ordered the chartou overalls in gray n in size medium tho it took 5 weeks to arrive it really is an adorable bibs outfit i washed on delicate in cold water n hung to dry i wore the next day for 2 hours however both bibs straps broke when the hardware snapped right off on each sidebr br contacted seller right away they requested pics sent to them as proof the seller was apologetic and did end up refunding me fully the seller was polite n worked with me well to take care of this rare problem as they have been many satisfied customers with these cute bibs,1
came way too small in canadian size not us size,0
fit good and look great,2
no exaggeration when reviews a say this runs small this runs way small feels like a girls size it wore like a bandeau crop top not what is pictured at all,0
did not like fringe too big looks awful,0
these may look like sneakers but they are just cheap house slippers they have absolutely no support after walking in them for 5 minutes my feet were killing me,0
sent the grey tag artic and not the heavier black tag artic set highly unsatisfied unable to return cause i have to use them for my job the day after delivery,0
these are sooo cute but like everyone else has said the pattern starts to peel off for reference i work in a hospital and use these three times a week they are sooo comfy and i love them otherwise also i bought them at a crocs outlet and not on amazon,1
the colors run,0
feel great cant wait to try them out warm when used around the house fit is true to size,2
i knocked one star off right away because the inside of the shirt is whitenot really a good idea on a camo pattern shirt just seems dumb to me other than that this shirt is pretty good feels soft and light but would probably keep you warm on a spring or fall day pattern matched my rothco ultra force marpat bdu pants perfectly i ordered xxl and it fit exactly the way my other shirts fit so i give a perfect score on sizing i plan to use this for hunting and outdoors activities and i have a high degree of confidence that this shirt will hold up for a while multiple hunting seasons for sure b or a due to the white interior of the shirt but over all quality 55 star i would recommend this to anyone hunting paintballing or doing the airsoft thing would work really good for those applications,2
a lighter weight fabric than i was expecting and they run small oh and they only sent one pair despite my ordering and paying for two pairs,1
my son likes these and they are comfortable but they are a bit on the bigger side and the crotch hangs really low and baggy,2
i love this dress its fitted and compliments my curvy body im 55 240 lbs and bought an xl not too tight fits just right and the material is good,2
waste,0
i gave this a one star for the style but thats where it ends the bag is so stiff it makes it difficult to pull items out and place them back in with ease a month into wearing it the zipper broke it does not close now when i pull the zipper handle through to close the sides arent connecting unfortunately i do not recommend this bag at all and for the price save your coins up a bit more to get a better quality handbag this is a no go,0
poor workmanship on hemming size and color and fabric are good,1
super cute as described,2
nylon texture fine for price,0
great product that looks great and is of quality materials and construction,2
i ordered xl and noticed the waist size is 268 which is a little tight ridiculous sizing xxl is 268 inch waist same as xlbr br what do women look like where you live26 inch waists all your chinese stuff is small like this,1
these gym shoes are awesome very very comfortable light weight and looks really nice i wear these to work now everyday i do a lot of walking getting another pair,2
material quality is low,0
i am 55 usually a size 10 or medium and a 36c cup size and dress is too tight in chest area made for smaller chest,1
cute hat but not sure what age it will work for too kidish for me so i tried to give to my 13 year old nieces they both said to babyish for them so my 4 year old claimed it she loves it but of coarse it is too big for her head,1
this dress is soft and floats on me the colors are beautiful loved it so much promptly ordered it again in different colors update after washing in cold water and hanging up to drycant even get it on it shrank so much very disappointed the 2nd one i got washed in same load hung up to dry same size of course i can wear but its a tad snug in bust the 3rd one i ordered couldnt get it over my head to start with im sad that i had to update what was a 5 star product review,1
my grandmother loved it,2
these are good quality and cute pretty thin socks,2
im not going to go into detail about underware but i will tell you to buy these if you are on the fence just do it i really like them and wont wear anything else now,2
wore these twice and they broke as i was putting them on the third time very cheaply made and not worth the money they should have spent less on their ad campaign so they could actually manufacture a quality product do yourself a favor and go buy a better procudt at the dollar store,0
the sizing of these are terrible way way to small these pants run very small recommend getting 2 sizes bigger the ones i got are xl and they literally feel like a size medium to large,0
not skinny,1
this thing looks cool until you put it on the eyes are not even close g the o being usefulto see out waste of money,0
too small for me gifted but great quality as always with oakley,1
if not for the immediate wearing of the revlite outsole on the forefoot immediately under the ball of your foot id say these shoes are one of the most comfortable ive ever owned from day 1 no breaking in period but probably because im coming from nb 890v6sbr br however this is ridiculous for 100 pair of running shoes id expect not to have the outer sole material revlite visible damaged after 12 5mi runs on pavementbr br for comparison i had 890v6s for over a year and a half of running at least every other day i know too long and the treads were just wearing down to the midsole pretty good wearing lifebr br maybe its just an outer layer of the revlite material that sheds and then subsides but it seems pretty bad my shoes tend to wear smack in the middle of the ball of my foot so nothing off there either just excessive wear with barely any usebr br im estimating 34 months tops before the revlite pads are completely gone and im left with no outsolegrip on the forefoot maybe not but well seebr br update 71820 the blue material is now completely flattened after one month or 150 miles of runs no more grip terrible not sure what they were thinking but 1 month to donate these to goodwill is insane please fix in v9,0
love my yoga pants super comfortable plan on ordering another pair,2
i wear a size 95 shoe bought the large which claims to be for sizes 910 the slippers are way too big and slip and slide around when i walk made even worse by the slippery furry fabric unwearable slippers which is a shame because they are cute to look at,0
topaz is novembers birthstone not decembers i did not know this until after ordering it as a gift for someone with a december birthday frustrating also it does not come a box comes in a tiny plastic baggie sent in an envelope with no protection the pendant itself looks ok the chain looks super cheap like it would easily break disappointed will be returning,0
this necklace is pretty but i must say i dont like the 34floating34 center blue stone when you have the necklace on it sags and kind of points upward and looks broken other than that the stones are very sparkly and the pendant hits right below the hollow in the middle of your collarbone again the floating center stone is not my personal taste but if you dont mind that give this necklace a try,2
as you wear the brazier it moves and its never in place to hold n support your breast,0
stiff as wood sitting in the closet collecting dust,1
i live in arizona and it can get so bright especially late in the day when driving home these perfectly contrast the brightness and make it easy to see while driving and during day to day activities absolutely recommend and will buy again when i inevitably lose them,2
great shoes well made old favorite,2
okay nothing special quite unforgiving if you have any figure flaws you dont want seen,1
that is a very nice underwear soft and very comfortable but you should buy a size up instead of an l that you might usually wear buy xl etc,2
this small travel bag could be a convenient way to carry essentials when traveling or to use with an overnight bag the containers snapped in are somewhat small but would be good for a small amount of items cosmetics toothbrush toothpaste etc it could also be hung on a hook the snap at the top allies for hangingbr br the travel bag smells horrible i could smell it as soon as i opened the box the smell transferred to my hands too its made from polyester so im not sure if maybe it has a waterproof coating on it or what but i literally had to take it outside to airout and immediately washed my handsbr br if the smell dissipates it will be a good bag for a short trip or a trip where you arent taking tons of small items right now im trying to get over the smell,1
very short in the torso area barely comes to the top of my jeans,0
great earrings wore them on the fourth of july and got lots of compliments very light weight they do not pull on your ears,2
looks like the picture i ordered one size up the fit and color are good i ordered a medium and im 57 and 138 pounds and fits loosely however the material although comfortable is not cotton but more of a mix because it has a lot of elasticitybr overall i dont think it will work because after wearing it indoors im feeling to hot the material doesnt feel breathable to my skin i live in texas so 100 cotton is what i need in a t shirt to keep coolbr will be returning sadly because i like the look,1
this was a birthday present for my husbandhe has purchased 34members only34 jackets in the past so i ordered the same size he already owns to our great surprise it is too smallnot such a happy birthday for him after all,0
im a true size 6 and these arent true to side it is very narrow where the toes are so all my toes are cramped together unfortunately had to return these because theyre so cramped it hurts when walking,1
these are super cute and soft i ordered a 55 because thats what i usually fit in metal rings but for these i should have ordered the 6 theyre not painfully tight but it will get annoying id love to have these just in the larger size,2
this skin suit fits like a glove and is very comfortable the fabric has a slight sheen to it but it looks pitch black in low lights or a party setting as others have suggested order by height these things stretch nicely,2
i bought a size up to be safe and was still too small,0
its like those gum ball machine 25 cent fat chains looks nothing like the picture and much uglier in person dont waste ur money the seller wont let me return talk about internet robbery,0
they are loose on lockers and you are able to pull them open while the lock is still on,0
wrong size,0
these are very soft and comfortable but i got the mustard color and they are extremely see through was planning on using them for the gym but theyre only around the house pants because of this,1
my daughter likes it thats all that matters,2
this is about two sizes two small i have lost weight so it fits now got a large and i am 5346 200 but rather bottom heavy than top,1
it fit beautifully looks great cannot wait to wear it,2
cheap fabric it had a shine to it not like a normal hoodie the emblem felt like an ironon one wash and dry im positive it would fade and peel,0
got it as an easy costume for a disney trip got lots of compliments it is a nice feeling shirt,2
this is a great top i got lots of compliments the first time i wore it the top is a size medium before washing and drying will shrink to a size small in the dryer which was what i needed i recommend hang drying to keep it a medium size if it fits you well right out of the package its not too see through just wear flesh tone under garments,2
at first i absolutely loved these socks theyre so soft and perfect for hiking and dont rub at all perfect but now its been about 4 months and they are stretching out or something the elastic isnt as tight anymore they fall down and i end up walking on folds of sock and having to pull them back up all the time i loved them so much about 2 months ago that i was going to buy more glad i didnt,1
i would pass on this necklace it doesnt sit right agains the body and constantly twists around it tarnishes fast as well i felt like it was only a few weeks and it turned a funky color pass,0
nicebut small for a 2 xl,1
i asked my husband to try out this badger smith polka dot print button down shirt he usually likes blue button down shirts but unfortunately did not have a lot of positives to say about this one the first and most troublesome issue is that this size large shirt is cut very small and narrow at the shoulders when worn it looks unflattering if youre considering it youll need at least a full size larger second the white buttons and design accents at the inner cuffs button flap collar and back fabric locker loop are too much of a contrast against the deep blue color of the shirt and ends up looking cartoonish rather then trendy if they simply kept the shirt limited to the subtle polka dots on the blue fabric and cut the shirt larger then this would have been a fairly decent shirt,0
this ask was a hit for my halloween party however it was to small and hard to see and breath out of need larger sizes,2
i prefer 100 cotton but can not find it this is nice to wear for business xl would fit better but they didnt have that size,1
my boys loved it,2
so i like my clothes loose fitting and roomy i have a colostomy and so i need my clothes loose so my cbag isn t being strangled or smashed against me it can become very uncomfortable if my clothes are not loose i purchased 2 sizes bigger for this reason which the tag says its 2 sizes bigger than what i wear but its not it actually seems to fit me as if its my normal sizebr the price seems great but they are 2 to 3 sizes smaller than us sizes so purchase them 2 or 3 sizes bigger than you normally wear in us sizes,0
the pleats in the front of this plus the waist line placement make you look huge i still have a little baby belly from my two pregnancies and this made me look more than 6 months pregnant,0
this is a surprisingly comfortable bra the lace doesnt itch it holds everything in the way its supposed to and its very feminine,2
this is my fourth spyder coat and i love them all good looking and very warm what could be better,2
to large for me and somewhat see through,1
love this blouse it fits perfectly and is soft and comfy i will probably be buying a few more as it is an easy top to dress up or down,2
i love my necklace,1
bigger than i expected but cute,1
fits well have not worn it for active use yet but trying it on it was comfortable,2
like the slip,2
love this is an all inclusive kit including the storage bag to keep all moving parts together as shown in photos i used this on dirty stinky woven athletic running shoes and an all white casual athletic slip on both had seen better days from photo youll notice the foam cleaner breathed life back into both pairbr br foam is far more manageable to use then any liquid soap ive tried it can be applied like mousse to shoe directly or dispensed onto brush as needed the trick to this working is all in the brush itself the small bristles can penetrate thru a weave or into tight knit fabric it also does well on crevasses or designs in rubber soles make tiny circular motions till shoe is covered in a thin foamy layer it is necessary to add a bit of water to help move the soap and spread it out across entire surface once clean use watered down brush to dilute and dissipate the soap then use hand towel to blot and absorb any residual soap or excess water left over and finally air dry i suggest not using dryer it can alter glue causing permanent damagebr br 4oz kit is perfect size for college kiddos in dorm being all inclusive and of smaller scale this easily tucks into dorm room supplies on the go wipes are best for spot cleaning or traveling its always best to remove a stain asap and these will allow one to do so having a college athlete go is very particular about all her shoescleats this is a must have for her investment of footwear i also ordered the 8oz size to have at home for family use everythings the same with the exception of an 8oz foam cleaner hoping this info can help your decision stay safe,2
horrible decal came in a padded envelope that was folded in half in my mailbox which creased one of the decals and ruined it they are horrible quality decals theyre sticky on both sides for some reason which makes application nearly impossible once you get it applied it collects dirt and dust like nothing else because its sticky and feels more like paper than a sticker,0
i like these the only issue i had was that i wished they were slightly bigger ppl didnt really notice what it was until they got really close,0
this is cute but my god did they take the preview pictures with an electron microscope i thought this would be about as big as a penny its the size of lincolns head on a penny fyi,1
great quality and fit,2
very disappointed order first pair of my size too big ordered smaller size it fits lengthwise but when i walk my feet keep slipping out way too wide no support anywhere like a big rain boot perfect for wide feet i guess,0
very thin and easily broken,0
really cheep looking and feeling,1
fits great washs well,2
i got the ab size i am an a with a 32 inch band size i am really petite and this just looked like pillows attached to my chest it reminds me of that vs bra that adds two cup sizes which i wasnt a fan of it just looks too padded for my taste i prefer a smaller insert if i am going to use inserts the material looks decent and they are soft but not the look i was going for,1
the dress is almost the right size but the sleeves on the overwrap are childsized no where near proportionate to the size of the dress,1
cute but if you put anything in it prepare yourself to fight the popped zipper,0
material is thin but soft dont like the fit on me but i also just had a baby,1
the shoes are cute and my little one likes them the lights on the other hand only worked one day this shoes are not rechargeable like other light up shoes my daughter likes wearing them anyway,0
good band and durable have worn for a couple months and no scratches and fits well,2
the heal part of the sole is made of solid clear plastic it makes the shoe sturdy but also heavy and unmoving my feet get sore and tired in these shoes i have been wearing saucony since they first came to the usa and this is the first pair to hurt my feet,1
great for the pool fit as expected,2
just lovely flattering on,2
these are very cheap looking the part that goes through the ear is too thick on me one of them hangs sideways and i can not get it to face forward in short i cant wear them will not buy from this company again,0
arrived on time but they smell really bad dont know if i can use them,0
too thin not what i expected even in walmart theyre heavier same brand same type,0
these are adorable shoes unfortunately they hurt my daughters feet and she wont wear them very long,1
i havent had it long and the seams are already tearing,1
i love my wax blue jeans but these were not of the same quality they seemed very thin and were super short on me im 5 7 125lb and ordered a size 5 like my other wax jeans i was considering trying a 7 but i think im going to look around for a material that seems like it last,0
pretty shirt but with several reviews stating it fit small i ordered up i found the fit to be roomy in general with looser sleeves than i would have expected even with ordering up a size,1
not comfortable and fits oddly on the face got this for my mother for going out in public watched her out it on and it almost pinched her face all the while,1
there are no measurements to guide you for the purchase additionally unable to contact seller to find out measurements for bust waist hips unable to get the lengths for knitted sweater skirt sweater length shoulder measurementsthis purchase doesnt offer any informationthis item will more than likely returned,0
earrings are ridiculously tiny only a small plastic doll could wear these earrrings,0
extremely flimsey and doesnt hold shape could not get the earring to clasp ended up bending all out of shape cant wear them now dont bother,0
was nice just runs small,0
this product would work excellent if you had all keys the exact same size however i have handcuff keys large car keys and some normal door size keys i made the product work otherwise i would give it 5 stars,2
runs small and has a small neck opening i will be returning,0
these could have been nice if they were more true to size had some stretch i usually wear a victorias secret medium and after reading the reviews about how they ran small decided to order xl as soon as i took it out of the package i knew it would be way too small and there was barely any stretch to them,0
it is not comfortable on my hand,1
love this dress so cute with or without a jean jacket,2
i bought 4 of these and they fit very good and are nice and soft but the buttons are a little complicated its probably because theres so many of them but im sure theyll get easier as time goes on also im sure itll be easy for most of you as most of you are probably not visually impaired i probably shouldnt have mentioned the buttons then theyre fine for people with normal eyes,2
returned sole was to narrow strap over the top of the foot was to loose uncomfortable,0
fine for informal wear but the stones are not all straight or centered in the earrings,1
too small,0
they are so tight even on the loosest notch they are way tighter than what a chain choker should be i couldnt even move my neck with it on,0
cute fess but it fits too small in the chest area,0
great little skort super comfortable and looks fantastic,2
the vest was as described,2
wrong size plastic material not flexible enough for me want more comfortable shoes pretty decorations,2
these boots run very small and are hard to put on,1
ok so im 53495 almost 53410 depending on what day it is i was excited for this due to the reviews about the garments stretchability i ordered a medium because most jumpsuits tend to have a gap at the back where it doesnt fit to my curves and i wanted a tight fit to hold me in it did fit tight but not to the point that i was uncomfortable the sleeves were short as well as the ankles as you can see i plan on adding sequin material to the wrists and ankles to accomodate for that that was no surprise its a very sexy outfit if it came in a 34tall version34 i like it ill only wear it once anyway but tall and curvy girls beware ill update my review after i make alterations and try it on again right now its a solid 3 due to the length,1
very difficult to get off and on because there is no elastic in the neck or sleeve serious manufacturing flaw im going to have to buy an entirely different swim suit no elastic in the neck it doesnt allow for any give very difficult for my granddaughter to get off and on when its dry or wet either one very important for you to know,0
affordable and comfy,2
returned stiff material,0
i ordered two junk headband and both were poor quality the seams were not even sewn on the black one and the american flag one the seam was sewn together so it doesnt fit properlybr br i will never order the junk brand again,0
i was hoping this dress would fit me and it was ok a little snug but not uncomfortable it didnt look snug so i kept it as it was purchased for special occasion trip the sleeves are not secured very well but enough to keep the look together i workout and have muscles so it was snug on my arms and across my back the stitching didnt stay as the fabric stretched and ultimately i was only able to wear this dress one time its a cute style and ill try to find someone to duplicate it so it doesnt fall apart the fabric also was sewed crooked where the pattern was lopsided the attention to detail was not there i wouldnt buy from this company again it had so much potential but delivered a huge fail,0
dress runs small for the run chart so go up atleast 1 or maybe 2 sizes,0
did not like the closure very hard to get closed also the lapis lazuli bead was very small you couldnt really tell what it was i returned it,0
i am really into any top with pockets these days this shirt did not hang it fit right as the waist like a sweatshirt i didnt like that,1
really loved these shoes but broke after 2 months,2
i like these pants they fit as i expected them to fit,1
the shorts feels good on you but the padding isnt that great for long rides i use them under my other shorts and they work great,1
beautiful shoes but they run small and the straps across my toes hurt,1
fantastic shoe very cute and comfortable,2
this bow belt is super cute and i bought it for that reason however i am 57 116 pounds and a size 4 or 2 depending and it was very snug on me i am assuming the sizes abroad and bone structure abroad could be the reason as that can contribute but if you are any bigger than a us size 4 i would not buy this belt its cute and i will wear it but again the size is very childlike,1
its a big square so hard to wrap around your neck cute not maroon more of a pinky red with a bright yellow,0
exactly as the other reviews state cheaply made but serves its purpose,2
bought the medium size for my bag thats roughly the size of a sheet of paper interior its so wonderful i have everything i need and can actually find it why did i not know about these until now organizers dream,2
fit well,2
i am so in love with this purse it looks like a grown up ladys purse but is still harry potter which i love lot of times stuff like this looks childish but this purse is so pretty and professional looking very roomy and holds its structure,2
i wear a size 9 shoe and thought this large sock would fit but it is tight around the ankle,0
these are the wrong size theyre just as big as my 716,0
it was much thinner than i had anticipated but the 20mm width did fit the watch perfectly,1
queda muy justo y como que se bajabr talvez es por la tela es caliente pero no me gusto que tenía que andarme lo subiendo,1
the tail is the only part that is ever worth anything the bikini its self is garbage,0
they kinda hang the other ballheart is fused on doesnt look like the picture waste of money,0
doesnt look anything like the picture,0
not the right color,0
very very very small,1
the vest extenders would not stay buckled,1
sheer on the back but really cute and nice although it fit a bit too long on me but i am 49 so i still recommend it,2
its a nice purse but after only a week the front leather stitching decorative started to come out,1
buy it bigger than your size runs small,0
looks better than pictures amazing got it for grandson for christmas cant wait to give it to him great value price amazing,2
very satisfied looks awesome,2
i like the color and style of the jeans however the only issue was that there is not a lot of roomunder the waist the waist fits perfectly but underneath there isnt a lot of space,2
as much as i wanted to avoid writing a review the smell of the shirt calls for itif a guy from san francisco and snuggle were to make a beast of two backs and keep them selves warm with a shirt it would be this shirti can understand strange scents from new thingsbut it smelled like a mix of floral kool aidanyways ladys and gents ill put it to wash out but its disappointing i have to damage the shirt just to wear itoutside of the aroma shirt is perfectly in line with a xx large dimensions,1
i bought this as a gift for my sister but i ended up not giving it to her it is cheaply made and changes color pretty quickly,1
the dress is quite cute and it fits pretty well the fabric is ok but the dress is not made that great but its cute over allbr but if you wantes it to be puffy and flouncy this is not the dress for you it just looks awkward with a petticoat underneath it you get what you pay for and what you pay for its a cheap cute dress thats not the best quality but still looks nice,1
granddaughter loves them,2
i am ashamed at the other reviews on this item i actually own this watch while the fit and finish is very good it loses about 3 seconds every 10 years this is unacceptable even in a budget watch such as this one,0
i wanted to like this shirt so badly because it is terrific quality a nice thick material and i love the sleeves but it was just a little bit too boxy for me so it wasnt flattering i think if it were about 2 or 3 inches longer that definitely would have helped,1
exactly what i have been looking for just the right size,2
received through vine for an honest reviewbr received size 2x but runs small measurements are that of a standard us largebr design is somewhat misrepresented looks like the waffle weave thermal shirtsbr not red but more coral redbr 80 percent polyester 20 percent algodaobr nicely designed but could use some improvement,0
i ordered this pumpkin scary mask by disguise to wear around the house to impress my wife and cat kidding but so far this is all ive used it for as the design is not as pictured the pumpkin look is a smaller design that does not look at all like the full face design pictured it is similar to the pictures sometimes in amazon that are small enough to not allow you to see detail and wont enlarge the mask goes fully over the head to just below the jaw and back hairline would be more sized for a child than an adult not what i expected,0
i bought this belt to use fastened tightly to hold up some jeans that sit on my hips the cinching has caused the top layer of the belt to split and tear away from the inner layer around the hole ive only had the belt two days if it does not tear through im ok with using it as i usually have my top over it but if it breaks completely i will be back to downgrade my reviewbr br came back and downgraded because belt wore through all layers see photo its not solid leather it only has a thin leather surface bonded to other material,0
no me gustaron nada los colores,0
comfy and casual these fit as expected great for lounging around or walking the dog the pockets are a good size for a big phone,2
what professional wants to walk around the office with shoes that makes noice with each step,1
very very stiff making them uncomfortable i like the look though but clunky,1
i do not understand how something can be shown as the correct color but when it is delivered it is not that color this top has too much yellow to be called fuschia it is more of a bright pink than fuschia not at all as pictured on the website,0
pretty shirt runs small,1
was delivered early exact item picured in package,2
im sure i will love these but i have not yet received them i am hoping they will be different than the last beads that i ordered,2
this key chain is exactly as described it appears to be very well made sturdy and has clean lines in its design and style i purchased two brown with tarnished silver and black with silver they have not been put to daily use yet but i am confident they will hold up and do very well,2
like the other scam chinese products this too will take your money and will not shipped your item to your house like they did to me it is the same thing with the other low quality china products that i bought directly to china beware this is a scam,0
super cute color is same as pictured have worn daily for months and no marks or wear and tear love this,2
super quick delivery my husband loves them ty,2
these dont have very much paddingi have other skecher shoes that are really alot betteram disapointed in these will wear them around townbut are not good for working,1
hate this bra and very uncomfortable not flattering at all,0
the lace is super soft and fit fantastic but was a bit disappointed to turn around to check out my butt to see a large white tag that is completely visibly through the lace right in the middle of the seam i cut the tag out sooooo carefully only to still have the seam split and now theres a hole i can stitch it but 3 stars cause i have to do some work on new clothing,1
just good chain for pics not actually jewelry u can wear out without it probably breaking or tarnishing its perfect for what i needed tho so,1
i just received them and they are a little bit bigger then the picture but overall they are really pretty and shipping took about 15 days,2
cheap junk do not wast youre money,0
i have a small build and a small is usually my size a small in this is a little tight which is fine thats what i wanted but my normal movement has literally torn the material in numerous spots after one wear im not moving like crazy these are normal movements and the shirt is essentially falling apart and ive only worn it once dont waste your money,0
flimsy material,1
they where beautiful and fit pefect and very comfortable i thought the 9 would be to big just a tad bit not ro much but id rather be safe then sorryi actual ordered this entire outfit from amazon,2
these shoes look clunkier in the picture than in real life they are actually quite cute however the color was way different than the picture the shoes i got were bright pink i would have prefered the light coral color from the picture also the shoes run at least half a size too big i wear size 10 and there was a full inch of room in front of my toes and i was slipping out while walking otherwise they were pretty comfortable for heels,1
loved the dress somewhat tighter then i want it but nice for the event i worn it too,1
this shoe runs small so order a half size larger at least the toe box is a bit narrow too i bought a pair of brooks ghost 6 at the same time and do prefer the brooks better cushion and heel support and runners world rates the brooks ghost as their 1 choice four years running for men and women this shoe is better than nike or reebok their quality has taken a big dive since manufacturing was outsourced imho but i do like the hot pink color all in all i prefer the brooks so returned these with no problems from amazon,0
it looked as though i had wrapped a piece of black gauze around my waist totally see through very disappointed,0
perfect,2
we didnt end up using them as they were too small for my 11 yr old,0
so thin these snap with hardly any effort i would never purchase these again,0
smaller then i thought theyd be and one earring was broken had to use superglue to get it to stick together since this was a christmas present and i didnt have time to wait around for a refund or another pair to show up just hope my mom doesnt notice where i had to fix it,1
i love this bag it is great looking and a wonderful size it is made of very sturdy material it is great for every day use or traveling i think it is very durable and will last a very long time,2
nome agrado nada el producto pense k era pantalon un pokito mas grueso pero no es solo una licra y la blusa parese una bata,0
very well made bag,2
nice looking unfortunately getting them in my husbands normal size fit but caused his finger to get skin problems from being too close to his skin as the silicone sticks his finger under the ring looked like hed been in the bath for the day i think well stick with metal style rings,1
i wish they were a little bit longer and had second cargo pocket,2
very well made they were pricey but i believe you get what you pay formy husband wore them they put blisters on his feet we thought they would stretch out they did notwish we would have known they werent true to size,1
the sizing on this is more of petit fit i ordered l but typically wear sm and it was way too short barely reached my belly button this is not for average woman size the sleeves are also short with armpit area being extremely uncomfortable the fabric is nice and soft and the color is a nice off white but cant were it,1
this has to be a fake bag ive only had this bag for 4 months and it is already showing tons of wear and tear the leather is rubbing right off on the handle where i carry it and where the shoulder strap is attached ive had genuine michael kors bags purchased at the mall retailers and they have lasted for 4 years before showing this kind of wear and tear my mistake thinking i could buy a legitimate bag on amazon i will not make this mistake again,0
wonderful amazing,2
this is a very basic tshirt fit is as expected im 57 180 lbs material is decent but there is absolutely no give or stretch to this shirt so it can feel restricting if you are reaching for something i found myself constantly fidgeting when i wore this,1
ended up being way too small so i never got to wear it couldnt return it either,0
it was ok but not true to size i ended up giving the dress away because it was to small,1
i really like thembr very durable good quality,2
its okay it has nice pockets and size but it is a cheap bag it falls apart easily the color faded very quickly it wont last very long as an every day bag,1
i was looking for ankle and calf coverage the length was shorter than expected so im using them for ankle warmth onlynice toasty the patterns are attractive,0
nice socks but order a size up i originally bought 23t for my two and a half year old but they were too small i then bought the 45t and they are great i like the non slip rubber on them,2
love these nice and cushiony but not bulky at all im replacing all my socks with these to make sorting on laundry day easier plus ive never found a sock i liked more that is still manufactured,2
i do believe that if i would sneeze this would be long gonebr br this is the tiniest little charm for 22 that ive ever seenbr very dissatisfied,0
good but larger than avertised,1
i love this yoga shorts its comfy and stretches well material are soft and absorb sweat quickly mixed between polyster and spandex this yoga shorts fits me properly and doesnt see through for reference im 52 and about 110 lbs typically xs s for most of yoga pants legging the side pocket made it convenience to hold a cellphone keys and some cash money last time i wore it to swimming in the river and it was dry out quickly impressive,2
not fitted for size like it says not happy with them,0
beautiful piece,2
very cute but had an allergic reation so i had to trash them,1
a good belt,2
bueno,2
i didnt even get to wear this because i washed it once and it shrunk so badly it was way too short to be worn as a dress it was fine before i washed it but if you do purchase it would recommend hand washing and hang drying to avoid shrinking fabric is somewhat thin but it wasnt seethrough or anything wouldnt recommend for the price i would have returned this item but missed the return window waste of money,0
i dont like no quality material only images looks nice but fake product waste money,0
somewhat small but very comfortable i will buy 1 size bigger if i were in your shoes,2
best online order ever softness like lu la rue but not the price i will be purchasing more of these,2
i am 5 8 130 lbs i ordered a small and its way too tight the strings on the side were riding up into my armpits and it pulled tight so the back looked weird i usually wear small in everything but would def get a medium if you are taller and have a longer torso its super cute otherwise pretty good material,1
this was awful i was so excited to get this shirt and i returned it immediately i ordereded an xl and it could be a medium at best very thin cheap fabric if you buy get 2 sizes bigger or just buy something else altogether,0
poles broke immediately piece of junk,0
shirts run small especially the length 3t fits like 2t and 2t fits like 18m would not buy again,1
nice vibrant shoe color but i ordered it in my sons regular size hes a slender 12 year old and it was way too tight his toe was up against the front with zero room i strongly recommend 12 1 full size larger depending on width of your foot,0
the credit card slots are tight hopefully they will loosen up with use hard to get the cards out,2
i was really excited to receive this tee i love the acid wash look and design when i unpackaged it the shirt is not a cotton or even tshirt material it is more stretchy with a slick sheen to it i am heavy chested approx 165 lbs and ordered the xl the shirt fit but it was not flattering at all it was very boxy looking and the material basically ruined it for me had this been a cotton tee i would have loved it and the shape probably would have been better i am returning it as i know i will never wear it,0
i loved the style but it would need to be ironed to look decent i ended up sending it back,1
it was more like a store bought halloween costume,0
its a decent item but the person we bought it for is a 2x so we bought a 4x so it was really big it was so small that she couldnt even get it on it fit like a medium in the us,1
awesome product,2
i really love the fit of these bike shorts but they do not last long by the second month they were already getting holes in the thighs,1
white is very sheer not flattering shows every lump and bump you didnt know you had,0
they ran very small and were pretty thin like tights i returned them for a refund,0
this purse is really beautiful and well made for the price it was the perfect complement to my 20s costume unfortunately the purse had a horrible smell when i took it out of its plastic packaging hence only 3 stars the funky smell was really strong and my hands smelled after touching it i aired it out for a couple days without any luck and finally hand washed it twice with tons of soap and cold water this seemed to do the trick not sure if the smell is from some kind of chemical or what reminded me of some funky smelling shirts from bangladesh i ran across while working at a lowend retail clothing store in college also the attachable shoulder chain snags clothing really easily did not work well with my lacy dress but i was able to take it off and use the handle worth it if youre on a budget and have time to wash it,1
i really love this combo of turquoise and yellow gold very comfortable,2
had does not look as pictured spandex silk material material doesnt form to the underside of bill overpriced for the quality of this hat do not recommend,0
this mofiz polo shirt is really pretty good the material is well made and soft cotton with an stretchy spandex blend so itll hug you without preventing free range of motion the collar was good and soft without any rigidity and all that would be goodexceptbr br i got size xl because im not a slim and trim young guy any more the cut is not a classic cut but rather a slim cut and if you have a few extra pounds this will unfortunately not be for youbr br so nice shirt nice materialsas long as you are slim,1
i ordered these for hubby in several colors the navy blue were not sized right so i returned this pair ordered another pair of the gray ones,0
for women with nails its hard to screw on back they should make them with a snap on also the stem is tooo big for cartilage,1
this dress is paper thin so extremely cheap if its priced over 1200 dont buy it because it is junk and extremely tight,0
this looks completely different compared to the pictures showed on line returned,0
ive purchased them twice always too big they run a whole size bigger than normal,0
i should have read the reviews more carefully it mentions infinity scarf in the description and another reviewer had called it an infinity scarf it is not another reviewer had mentioned the bad smell and yes there is definitely a strong smell when you take it out i am keeping it because it is the exact color i need and i have not had luck in finding another in that shade it is soft not scratchy but it is not what i thought i was getting i have to take some of the responsibility for that as the reviews contradicted each otherbr br i will take more care next time,1
these are as wide as a house and the arms are too short,0
bought for my husband and he loves them he said these are the best shoes hes ever owned now take that with a grain of salt he has only bought 3 pairs in 40 years lol,2
i love the fit of these socks and they are great for running and cycling good job on the fit,2
was too small cant wear them,0
i wear a 657 bracelet i wear a small in watch bands and this scrunchy is very uncomfortable and tight tried stretching it out and nothing worked i wear scrunchies and ponytails everyday on my wrist but this i can not wear i just put it on to take a picture for this review and it has already put marks on my wrist way to tight,0
shoelaces what more can i say,2
perfect little vintage style bag in my opinion not just 90s it does have a slightly chemically smell from the material that im hoping will dissipate as it airs outbr br i ordered the black one and its just as its pictured comes with a square zebra print scarf with a beige background and black board can be used as a headscarf or tie it on the bag for an elegant look it also comes in a nice sturdy box for storage i will definitely order other bags from this brand,2
these ear muffs are so warm and comfortable i liked the feel of these down muffs so much i ordered 3 more pairs in different colors,2
very nice product but i ordered an xxl receive a med it was a birthday gift so very sad,1
attracts lint like crazy in dry climate not a fan of material and it kind of looks like im wearing a sack should have returned im curvy this has no shape to it bad construction seams and zipper sticks will not wear outside of house havent been wearing in the house either now that i think about it,1
these are cheap but do the work one of the lens was out of frame when i got them at this price i cant be bothered returning them,1
probably my favorite flannel have had it for a few weeks and no negatives for me i wear xl and ordered xl even though some reviews said it runs small it fits great even a little big so i shrunk it in the dryer i suggest getting it,2
beautiful vibrant colors but not soft at all very stiff fabric,0
these are my second pair of crocs i purchased the first pair in smoke black these in iris multicolored i love the fit and comfort of these shoes however what i love most about the iris is they look good with just about everything i wear they make me smile and every time i wear them i get complimentsbr br i normally wear a size 65 wide but settle on a 7 i got these in a 7 and they are not tight,2
its ok i thot it would be a bit more tailoredbr i wish it was longer too,1
i flew back to my home state to visit family while i was there my grandpa passed away my family lives far from any shopping malls and summer isnt exactly prime shopping season for a funeral dress i took my chances and purchased this dress via amazon prime i am glad i did it was excellent quality and classy it is a little thicker material so i recommend as a fall or winter dress i did size up based off measurements i am usually a size 4 and i purchased a size 6 i am 5 6 122 lbs 34 bust it fit great,2
this is not a wrap dress and the material feels like very thin paper,0
i was surprised at this narrow shoe had to return and try another for my grandchild,1
this runs a little small i suggest buying a bigger size as other reviews suggest,1
the necklace was too bulky for me and very hard to hook on with the loop closure returned,1
stiff as a board,1
nice material not thin or cheap looking fits well like 45t easy pull over head style vibrant colors granddaughter loves it she is about 41 tall and slim about 34 lbs,2
prombr she looked gorgeousbr very pleased,2
pretty but way too small,0
once again all the ladies like to ask where i get my kicks from i simply say amazon todays my birthday but im partying tomorrow so ill definitely be rocking these,2
super comfy i wear them all day,2
this shirt has a loose fit but it is a very comfortable casual shirt this linen is not one of those light and transparent fabric it has a nice weight to itbr i bought two of these in different colors and will be wearing them a lot this summer,2
bottom were too small not for curvy women size up however the top fit fine,1
i love the dress and the material butthe seam that connects the dress top to skirt is toosomething it is impossible to zip the dress the zipper hangs up at this seam and will not be zipped i can pull hold the two sides together with several inches to spare you would think that would be enough even when the dress is just on a hanger the zipper has issues with that seam as i said i love the dress it is a classic style i so wanted to be able to wear it to a banquet with a pearl necklace oh sigh not to be i had to return it and that was a great experience fast and thank you no headache,0
returned immediately frames were bent and didnt fit not sure if manufacturers issue or delivery issue but beware,0
super cute large shades which look perfect and fit perfectly on my oval face the style and design are true to the picture and look very retro fit well with plastic nose guards easy to adjust the ear pieces as well to fit better very large coverage keeps the sun out of your eyes and also keeps it out of your periphery as well great dark lenses with a gradient frame which are super comfy for all day use and definitely make my eyes feel protected very well made very heavy yet very sturdy as well easy to travel with and easy to pack away even if they are large shades one of my favorite stylish additions,2
the zipper broke in less then a month i bought it back in march 21 2021 and broke may 5 2021 cheap zipper,0
great product overall so far enjoying it,2
the catch is so loose that i list the pin the second day i wore it,0
it fit well in the bag for which i bought it however it is a little more flimsy than i hoped it would be im sending it back be cause i cant get the zippers to open and close ive reevaluated the use of this bag and intend to use it for something other than what i ordered it to be used as it has nice pockets and is very roomy in center pocket therefore i will be keeping it,1
been using this watch for a few months now i love the simple design,2
first off the cosplay itself is beautiful i was completely thrilled with the design and quality of what i received however i just had bad luck in the process and happened to get a shirt with a gigantic hole on the side seamsbr for someone who is 52 150 lbs typically wears a 34x30 in mens pants and a medium in tshirts and a 34 ddd the outfit was just a hair too snug for my torso the back probably wouldnt zip up all the way if i were to wear it long term definitely not without help so i already had ordered one size up to a large i recommend one more size up and it would be just the perfect amount of fittedness i am really disappointed there was a hole because this was my back up cosplay since prime could get it faster for me since ezcosplaycom wasnt going to make my order arrive to the states in time sooo definitely sucks i dont even want to wear this with the gigantic hole i am not sure if i could even safety pin it so the 3 stars will be for the fact it did come damaged and for the sizing chart definitely being a little misleading otherwise if you can order early to find your exact size it is a great cosplay,1
i wear a 2x bought 4 x and it is too small,0
ive had this band since the middle of november 2020 up until a week ago it worked great and felt great then started separating from the device fortunately i didnt lose the watch because it falls off when im sleeping or was lucky enough to notice it while wearing during the day,1
the top has some weird 34side boob34 action going on it has too much fabric there and it creates a weird flap that shows my entire breast,0
ordered an extra large and it is about 12 inches wide when laid down on the table the material is awful and the print isnt lined up on the front or the backbr wound up sending back for a refund,0
so cute i get compliments when i wear it,2
the shape of this shirt is weird its ok but i def do not love it,1
so pretty not too heavy and look fantastic love the style and quality made well and look great,2
they just dont look right too large,1
i should have purchased a larger size though because there is no flexibility to the waist being a womens cut they felt as though the sit a bit higher than i would have liked too,0
after wearing once 2 of them split at the seams garbage,0
this is my first nursing bra im currently 25 weeks pregnant and needed new bras everything was getting too tight figured i would need nursing ones eventually so i started wearing them now they are super comfortable the bra extenders and clips are really usefulbr br im about a c cup and this bra gave adequate support i would imagine though if i was larger it might not be enoughbr br definitely would buy more if i need them,2
this is a beautiful band but i only wore it a couple of times and some of the stones fell out i wish i could geta refund but ordered in april and its 6 months later i dont think its worth the money,0
they cannot get the size correct i have ordered these slippers 4 times from size 12 to 15 and only once have they fit i want these slippers because they are great except the one time i washed them they had this gluey stuff around the sole left glue prints all over my floor had to throw away a perfectly good pair of slippers,0
not the same green as pictures,1
works great,2
i thought they would be bigger they look like they would break really easy,0
perfect coat because its not too bulky for her to wear in car and keeps her very warm definitely order this one,2
beautiful dress very comfortable,2
i purchased this because the pictures made it seem as if it was the shorts and shirts it is just the shirts,2
extremely cute but the butterfly on the side fell off it broke within 4 weeks i only gave it 3 stars because its cute i love butterflies also it fits reeealllllyyy big if you have a small wrist like me,1
these are the most comfortable sandals ive ever owned im a hairdresser and im able to wear these on a concrete floor for 9 hours a day with no problems i want them in every color,2
too small polyester fabric too hot for arizona returned item,0
i love this wallet because it is thin but holds everything my one complaint is something broke off the zipper and now there are two sharp things protruding and scratching me very disappointing,1
very nice bag bright color as described on advertisement very happy with purchase great price,2
very cheap but you get what you pay for,0
bulky heavy hard to get on another waste of money,0
i ordered a size six and ended up having to wear this ring on a different finger because it was too small upon checking it on my ring sizer i discovered it was a 5 12 i still love the ring and just wear it on a different finger the scroll design is elegant and pretty yet sturdy enough to retain its shape beautifully it is well made and free from anything that can get snagged in clothing i had a previous scroll ring with open scrolls which got caught on everything so i purposely ordered this ring with closed loops for that reason i am allergic to nickel and have had no bad reaction wearing this ring i wear it 247 and love it thank you,2
luggage is made very cheap and came with some of the handles broken this luggage would not make one trip,0
no problems,2
these were bigger than expected and the straps adjust but dont stay,1
zipper broke the first day,0
pretty but a little big and made my ears itch a bit,1
i love the look of this but it torn in the back after one wear and i didnt even have it on all day,1
edit its now been 7 months since i bought these the ankles ripped on the one boot the cheap boots lasted longer than these down to a 1 starbr br im a girl who normally wears size 95 womens i was looking for a noncamo durable boot and decided to try these size 8 mens fit me finebr br ive only had these boots for a few months so i cant say much on durability at this point but what i did immediately notice were the ankles they are so tight ive never had boots fit like this i guess its good as my foot is never going to pull out of the boot but it took some time to break these in i literally rubbed the skin off my ankles the first week because they fit so tight there they fit fine in every other aspect so i decided to just keep them and break them in they are much better now but the ankles are still quite tight not rubbing skin off tight but still quite snug,0
i have been wearing ryka intent xt and xt2 i wanted something with a little more color i do a lot of walking and after checking the reviews i ordered this shoe i like the looks of the shoe and when i first put them on the memory foam innersole felt great but after wearing them for about an hour my feet were killing me couldnt get them off fast enough guess ill have to try another style seeing this was my first bad experience with ryka maybe that innersole isnt good for me,0
this is a decent sweater although it definitely has a casual look to it it is not very fitted in the waist but it is comfortable and warm it does look good with jeans its a good staple to have on hand for cool winter daysnights looks good with a turtleneck under it or a tee like shown on the model picture,2
with a head that is slightly on the larger side i found this hat to be just a little too tight and short for me an additional negative was how easily the hat retained strands of my hair from merely trying it on the material just seems prone to collect lint cosmetically the hat is cute with the flower providing an extra degree of pizaaz overall given its strengths and weaknesses i do think the hat is overpriced at 25 but its your money,1
the key holder itself works just fine for what i needed it for however i was sent an previouslyowned unit that whoever had it before me had cut the little leather loop that connects to the snap clip even though i am not using that actual part it is not cool to send a custom a used and defaced unit when being sold as new multiple stars off for being shifty,0
this dress ran huge im 51 105lbs 342635 and got the smallest size it also just didnt fit at all like i expected the material was thicker and less stretchy than i was expecting i mean what can i say that the picture doesnt show,1
just received this watch today the only thing can say is wow time will tell on the longevity of the watch if this is anything like my other invicta watches all looks good,2
this is perfect,2
this is a cute bracelet it is thin and looks more expensive than it is i read the reviews about it being small since my wrists are on the smaller size i thought itd be okay no its very small its not easy to close the bracelet on my wrist and when closed it is tight not a bangle at all unless you have very small wrists id pass,1
look well made but even when extended to largest length make it difficult to take glasses down made way too small ill give to my grandkids because they are useless for me,0
light and inexpensive these are perfect for summer i went back and bought every color they had,2
i absolutely love this shirt it is very soft and comfortable on form fitting and very attractive i buy a lot of mens shirts of this type because i like wearing them underneath other shirts in the winter it is also super attractive as an outer shirt even for a woman as long as the body type is wellproportioned and trim i tried this on my boyfriend and it did not look good on him because he does not weight lift however for a bodybuilder this shirt is perfect whether a man or a female despite that it is marketed for a manbr br i machine wash this on cold in a lingerie bag and i prefer to hang dry the tag says this can be tumble dried on low but i personally find that this increases wear on these type of shirts at the current price of 1799 i feel this is a good purchase i would definitely order this again if i were in the market for another one,2
fit as expected do a great job of keeping your little one warm adjustable shoulder straps are just velcro and you really cant adjust too much also the elastic part around ankle is loose and doesnt fit tight against other than that though these work pretty well,1
fits smaller than notmal,0
i was so excited i opened the clasp to try to put it on seconds after the package arrived in the mail the clasp broke off the chain unable for me to fix it never got to even wear it,0
grand daughter loves them made very well great price,2
great little bag that fits all the essentials like my toothbrush tongue cleaner floss and my contact lens stuff the build quality feels pretty solid as well,2
okay,1
love it i was planning on a run of the mill thin cinch bag this is heavy duty has great straps and clasp in front to hold straps together across chest zippered pouch grandson loves it and its perfect size for his gi belt nunchucks and water bottle,2
shirts are thinner than what you would expect sleeves are short sleeves and shirt bottom also curl,1
i like the purse but it has too many pockets i cant find anything easily,1
i went a size up cause of review and they hurt more than helped i use them as house shoes,1
these were exactly what i was hoping for however they are not true to size i wanted them baggy so i got size bigger than normal and it was still 3 sizes too small perhaps they sent the kids version,1
i have spent 100s on shoes and i had just about given up i came across these and decided to give them a try because i really needed to exercise and lose some weight shoes came with an arch support sole that fit my feet great i have had these for a month and my feet are tons better i wear them to walk up and down bleachers and walking 2 miles i really did not think anything was going to help me but these have and i am so grateful i never write reviews but i cannot say enough about these shoes,2
i was hoping for something more absorbent and cushiony,1
product arrived less than a month ago theyve been used inside for a few hours in the evenings theyre already falling apart im returning it for a refund aside from the shoddy workmanship the fit is okay nothing special but not uncomfortable either,0
this product is amazing i have a few loose fitting shirts that often slip across my torso this tape helped keep those tops in place i also cosplay and this tape is perfect for keeping my socks up,2
i did a lot of looking before i purchased these i was interested in a variety of nose studs with 5mm to 6mm length posts for 16 studs this is a great buy with a bunch of different styles but although theyre advertised as 6mm length they are all different lengths unfortunately i cant wear the longer lengths no matter how cute they are theyre just not comfortable in my small nose boo one of them was broken so lost another star there im guessing that since most of us are comfortable in a specific length if you buy these youll find maybe half will fit properly maybe you can pass some of them along to a friend who can use them the crystals are pretty sparkly,1
i love the shirt but there was a spider in it that bit me 5 times,0
too small for women with c cup or larger breast you need to bee flat chested to buy this,0
the locket fell off the chain as soon as i opened thebr package i tried to adjust the holder and it didnt work i had to replace piece with another holder from one of my necklaces,0
i love this piece its the second ive owned and i was delighted to see it available its perfect for everyday wear,2
great shirt and great fit better than than other brands i have ordered,2
these pants are very cute and i wish they fit but unfortunately i will be returning thembr its somewhat rare that highwaisted pants look good on me so i shouldnt be that surprised still these were not flattering i ordered a small and the waist fit well my waist is 2634 but the butt was baggy besides this the thighs were too tight my midthigh is only about 1934 around but these were too tight there yet baggy in the butt because of this i dont think a larger size will be any more flattering too bad because these are very cute,1
runs very small,1
the dress is more of a fuchsia color,0
the fabric was beautiful but the dress was very ill fitting its made for a tall girl with a long waist im short waisted and it looked ridiculous,0
they are so so soft the logo is well made they do fit a little smaller than i would expect most sweats to fit but still enough room to be comfortable,2
this is really pretty i really like it only downfall is i cant get the string to go straight it bends awkward,1
i cannot say enough good things about this belt i saw a very expensive name brand belt in the store and looked and looked for a generic one this is it it is just as beautiful as the 98 belt but with a fraction of the price i am in love,2
the metal peace on the belt broke off its not made very good faulty design its not easy to tighten up on your waste i ordered 2 of them i think i will be sending them back i dont recommend wasting your money on this belt not worth it maybe try a different brand this one is not worth the money,0
its a decent knit dress nice color flattering but its certainly not a sweater knit and i wouldnt wear it in cold weather which is what im looking for in a sweaterdress very disappointed,1
the watch arrived with the minute hand completely detached from the watch dial the package showed no signs of damage leading me to believe its a manufacturing defect unusable and unrepairable out of the box,0
primarily indoor slippers for me but due to their sturdiness their solid build and the rubber soles i also use these slippers to walk across the street to the mailbox with rain sometimes a part of the journey thus far these slippers have held up well though attracting some leaves that theyre no doubt unfamiliar with,2
expected three pairs as listed,0
i have other maidenform and wonderbra bra and this one seemed to fit differently the cups are too close together and cut off the sides of my breasts at the arm pits the 36 band fits more like a 34 not terrible but a little small disappointed cause the design is fun and gorgeous,1
i like the colors but white would be a good addition some type of pin with a a loop to keep you from loosing them,1
wide legs arent so wide tried 3 different ones before giving,1
love the crocs the feel so good on your feet they feel just like supportive slippers,2
i bought these leggings for a friends circus themed wedding it was a last minute purchase but they arrived quickly and once i put them on i liked them more than i thought i would it was a great addition to my outfit although i wish they were a little more visible under my dress i will be trying to find a reason to wear these more often,2
not for me,1
about one third of the keychains dont snap together or wont stay snapped together they are inexpensive though so just realize you wont be able to use all 50 in a package,0
i have a really hard time finding dresses that fit well and are flattering this dress not only fit both those criterion but its so comfortable ive had it for several years now and its still a go to would highly recommend,2
i love alegria shoes and own several pairs i get compliments all the time about how cute they are the bree clog is not cute or comforatble comfort comes first for me its an extra bonus if the shoe is also pretty,1
only for night driving cheap materials,0
good quality good comfort,2
was too snug around the upper arm areas and sleeves too short i loved the length and the thickness of the wool but it was ultimately too small for me as a big and tall man,0
too small for my taste but it is made well,1
i found this to be a very pretty fabric but the one size is too small and the tassels tend to snag and pull off a very delicate piece,1
they were really uncomfortable not like a i need to break these in but just really uncomfortable all the way around the sizing was accurate and i was able to return them,1
not a good glass design started peeling off within a couple of days of use,0
it is difficult to find socks that last more than one year these socks have added arch support so the arch does not wear out that quickly it also provides more cushioning these are the most durable sock you will find with this cotton content,2
these socks are cute and very comfy and so far have held up well through washing washed maybe 6 times since purchasing however theyre really big and floppy and the socks dont stay up well around my calves i wear a size 6 shoe womens and these socks are extremely roomy around the footportion especially around the toe to the extent that theyre a little dangerous to walk around in frankly the gripperdots on the bottom definitely help but i still have to be somewhat careful not to trip over all the extra fabric flopping around these are definitely slippersocks not regular socks they dont cling to your feet at all at least if you have smallish feet and i cant imagine trying to shove these in shoes,1
very flattering and comfortable love the long sleeves and length i am 57 and 120lbs ordered a small,2
these seemed perfect except that the4 arch support was in completely the wrong place for my foot,1
i love the softness the length and the look not a fan of how low the front scoops and seems a little tight but might just be my weight the most disappointing thing is that they pill heavily after just a few wears,1
longer than normal nipple rings and get stuck to things easily,1
this mask was not as picturedbr in the picture it looks tan and brown but what i received was olive drab and brownbr the material is paper thin toobr havent had a chance to see how warm it is yet but it does look very cool onbr i will update later,1
good for de manny,2
this band does not fit do not buy these bands i gave it one star because i liked the print i wasted money on two of these bands only one out of three fit,0
the glasses are attractive looking but terrible for video conferences because they are so reflective people cant even see my eyes just bright screen reflection and this in itself causes me eye strain they might be okay for just wearing to do computer work i have no way to determine if it really relieves eye strain but for video meetings they are not good,0
you get what you pay forbr br i am 32 weist and it was a bit loose on the hips washed it thinking it would fit it did not contacted customer service if i could possibly get a return but they did not i live in phoenix and it was extremely hot wearing this product,0
this is my first sleep shirt and i love it my wife convinced me to try a sleep shirt because we have grand kids in the house and if i get up at night im now covered up i used to sleep in my underwear and now i can sleep in this soft comfortable sleep shirt and wont scare my young grand kids when we all wake up in the morning or in the middle of the night i now own 3 of these sleep shirts,2
right size like individual compartments,2
i wanted to love this bra but the band is huge not sure how that is a 3634 band,1
for the price its just ok the material is super stretchy so i wish i would have bought a m instead of a l im 5634 and 160lbs and it 34fits34 but if i lose any weight i think it might be too baggy overall i think quality wise its overpriced but its a super sexy dress and i guess what do i expect for buying it without seeing ittrying it on i gave it 3 stars because the material isnt the best and somewhat thin,1
much smaller than advertised i will keep them as backup ok quality,1
watch out buying this item i thought since i am only 50 that it would be long enough but the slip part doesnt even cover my butt it fits like a breezy top so if you are looking for a dress star clear of this product,1
these gloves were nice looking but were too smallbr i have small hands and short fingers i always have trouble with fingers being too longbr but these gloves were too small for me to get in and out of easilybr i can imagine it being even harder once your hands get a little damp,1
very tight at shoulders sleeves too narrow and length shorter than desired returned,0
i really like the design on this shirt and bought it for my 14 year old son it is important to know that this is not tshirt material it is a shiny stretchy material the colors are nice and dark and it fits my son as expected i have not washed the shirt yet because my son is saving it for when it gets warmer out over all i am happy with my purchase and i cant wait to see my sons friends reactions when he wears it to school,2
i returned them because they fit some what large,1
what can you say about 282 for 100 backings for 50 pairs of earringsbr br these are very comfortable and secure my earrings well it is such a great deal for a product i will be using for many years to comebr br update i have had these for four months now interestingly the ones in the bag still unused are still fine the ones i use and wear continuously have gotten very very hard and brittle also the inner diameter of the post opening gets smaller too that makes them difficult to get on and off the earrings post,2
this wasnt an expensive top in was very reasonably priced the top is cotton and is nice it is not made from an expensive material but it is not horriblebr it fits true to size the colors are pretty and it looks really nice on i like the fact that the back of the t shirt dips lower at the back as i like tops which cover my buttbr this t shirt would pair nice with jeans especially white jeans or shorts on vacationbr you cant go wrong at this price,1
le regalé uno a mi cuñada en la talla que usan ella y mi esposa pero no le quedó el tamaño no es el correcto,0
the shoes are made cheep the wording on the heel part has already started to peel and my toddler wore them once,0
i did not like this outfit nothing about it was flattering the fit was weird the materiel was disappointing and itchy the shorts rolled up weirdly on the sides where the color band was like the shorts material was less sturdy than the decorative part the top was thin and see through disappointed,0
love the quality and material is very smooth,2
bracelet is beautiful the clasp is terrible the main connection doesnt lock and the side clasps are very loose and come open by themselves bracelet came undone the first day she wore it and fell off,1
didnt even fit my watch,0
love the shirt fits true to size made if good material not thin wonderful shirt,2
no son los colores que se ven en la imagen,0
very nice look and pricebe advised they are matte not shiny finish,2
the two piece 1920s outfit was perfect the quality was worth the cost very authentic dress,2
this top is a coral peach not a blush pink looking at the picture of the model one would expect it to be flowing which it is i would recommend for someone who is pregnant because there is a lot of room in the torso area that is to be expected but the color is off,0
ok but a little chintzy for the price,1
print lettering on shirt was already cracked and faded right out of the package it looks like itll completely come off in 23 washes,0
most caps in this price range come with stitched lettering and artwork but this cap has poor quality ironon letters and numbers i have not washed the hat after wearing 3 or 4 times the numbers and art are detaching from the hat the hat itself is not top quality eitherbr br this is a disappointing waste of time and money,0
the logo is beautiful the shirt is way too large and the fabric is way too thin,1
these extenders add at least two full inches to your bra band before you even get to the hook section so if your bra is more than two inches too tight these will probably do the job however if you only need an extra inch or so of breathing room these extenders will make your bra too loose even at the tightest setting,1
red jacket color is a darker red kind of a slightly tepid red not very attractive,0
the material feels cheap and the zipper gets stuck on the fabric covering the zipper often one side of the zipper has already busted its been used mf for one month,0
i love the sock design and where they are more compressed they are definitely on the large size if you wear a size 5,2
the bunny comes as advertised i do think it is super cute however the eyes are completely covered by its fur i recommend a hair cut if you buy,1
for the money i like it its not perfectly accurate with the features but it does keep good time and it is a nice looking watch its very comfortable on my wrist the band is very soft and flexible it just feels good on the wrist not a huge watch so thats good too i like it but temper your expectations in the accuracy department its a good value for the price if you like the garmin style military watches you will like this at a fraction of the cost,2
hoping they loosen up for now i will just wear thinner socks my military boots and all other shoes are 11s and fit fine these seem like a 10 34 but again hoping with some wear and thinner socks they will work update they did not loosen up so i will have to sell them to someone and look elsewhere for another pair,1
ordered this in two colors and the matching pants im a size small 32d and its a little loose on the shoulders which would be solved by a larger bust im fairly muscular so im not sure how it would do for more petite women unfortunately mine came with the tags already removed and it had been tried on before keeping because i like it but i paid for new condition not returned so definitely disappointed in that,2
good for the price,2
personally i think the xxl still runs small my main concern was how quickly this hat fell apart as soon as a small rip in the hat showed up through a very light bump it pretty much turned into a bigger hole within days i still wear the hat though as the share blocking factor is still works well,1
was looking for sun protection and after reading another review i bought this scarf is perfect,2
very comfortable,2
put the handles on one of the handle screws fell off and got lost after 1 use i have been unable go find any handles or screws i could order separately,0
such a simple idea but what a perfect product i was looking for something to hold my earrings where i wouldnt have to open them to store them then open again when im in a hurry to put them onso trays or something i saw this and thought thats it the pictures dont show it but the holder mounts so it is a little bit away from the wall to allow for the earring backs and hooks all of the hardware came with it including a couple of little mounts in case you want to stand the holder up instead of mounting it to the wall the only reason i was reluctant to give this five stars is because once i started loading it up i realized that a few posts along the bottom might have been nice i like to link my closed loops together and i could have hung them on posts easily but i can open one and drop it through any hole just as well love this product,2
i found these sunglasses to be super fun and lightweight the aviator shape is very stylish and these are great to throw in the car or beach bag they came with a nice case and a box for easy gifting very happy with this selection,2
this fits so perfect its long enough and goes to the middle of my thighs even being a tall girl myself i purchased this so that when i go on a cruise in november that it would be the perfect addition to a chilly night on the boat seeing will be traveling to the caribbean,2
unfortunately i had to return noy only was it this short but the waist was too small,1
these saved my daughter from constantly pushing up her glasses they also worked for her while playing basketball she said they are comfortable and she cant live without them now she tried nerd wax and it didnt last using these are much better,2
this is the second time ive purchased these for myself i love them theyre really comfortable and keep my feet warm this is important since i have had to have 2 surgeries in the past 6 months highly recommendbr br i purchased a third batch love these,2
super cute and big they long like a pen 2 of them the price is amazing,2
i put these in my boots and they seemed pretty nice however after the first day of work i had noticed at least had already started to fray by the second day the metal tip fell off of one end on the left shoe and both ends on the right i want to tie my shoe for my third day of work and the lace snapped,0
super cute suit on my daughter,2
shoes fit smaller than expected and the tongue on the right shoe is constantly moving out of center i have a friend that bought these and she has the same problem,1
i was disappointed in how these fit very tight in the thigh area,0
the top has a seam sewed into the slipper that is a little tight and needs to be stretched,2
middle of the road quality,1
i bought these because i liked the way they looked in hindsight while they look fine the quality leaves a lot to be desired the elastic around the legs is very low quality and doesnt hold well the stitching is also prone to tearing i would not buy these again i will spend a little more money to get a better product,0
you can see through the fabric even in the pictures you will not want to wear this without a slip when you belt it it is pretty cute the neckline is attractive the sleeves have a ruffle at the end the front is shorter than the back follow all washing instructions,1
too small,0
the band is oddly large and the straps are too wide set in the front they sit right in crevice of the armpit no support,1
thank god i have a chunky 3 month old this outfit is huge her sleeves are a little long and her pants arent fitting in the waist but they stay up so i like it,2
i had purchased real leaf earrings in a gold color at yosemite previously and had loved them i wanted a necklace to match i was a little hesitant about the purchase because these were so much cheaper than what i paid previously they turned out to be just like the previous purchase and are beautiful elegant and affordable,2
kind of narrow barely covers the ears pills easily i wouldnt recommend,1
had to return this item cute style fit good great color thin material,1
the belt is of good quality however my main issue was the moveable leather loop was too small into which to tuck the end of the belt i cut it off since most of my pants have a loop that will handle the end,2
would not hold 4 bills folded in half,0
cute dress fits nicely great color but quality was not as good you can see through the dress will need slip,1
very little support,0
bought as a gift and they loved it,2
what is up with this whistle it doesnt,0
yeah so if youre chesty and raise your arms in this you will free your boobs also it is sheer its cute but not useful i dont have massive boobs but it was still too small for them,1
very cute and well made these arrived much faster than expected,2
i used it as a coffin for my bird,2
very disppointed in the fit not very flattering,1
i this as a gift it seemed to fit well and the recipient mentioned they were warm and comfortable,2
the only dislike for me was the color i ordered what i thought was a burnt orange and i got a bright summer orange,1
made me want to get the real thing very realistic and didnt pinch to the point of hurting when magnetized,2
nice shirt,2
wrap dresses are usually a no brainer for me this one just didnt fit right it was a little too long on me im 55 and a bit too loose i want a huge fan of the fit other than that it was fine i think if you know this brand and you like the fit this dress will probably be lovely i suspect this is just one of those brands that doesnt quite fit me right,0
no arch support and slipper stretches out after wear my feet were not securenot worth the money,0
somewhat see through,1
while it is very very very cute it is very tiny my 11 year old is normally a size xs and we bought a medium and it is entirely way too small fits like a size xs it is cute though just buy a few sizes bigger,1
styling was great but the boots simply did not fit well at all,0
fine,1
i love the colors but im starting to wonder if these were not real nike shorts because i ordered an xs and they fit my friend who wears a large rather well theyre absolutely too big for me and i know what an xs nike shorts fit like dissapointing,0
the arms of this dress fits very tightly,1
this is a nice comfortable hat it is super stretchy it is really comfortable it looks nice it is deep in the rise but not too deep it makes it fit really well,2
cute but tarnishes after the first use would not recommend,0
do not buy i bought these camel leggings to wear as khaki pants for work i will never wear these and will return first the material is not regular legging material its more like super thick tights that look shiny as if im supposed to be wearing it in a circus show second the camel color is not khakibeige it is a light shiny yellow gold thirdly you can see right through them even with nudecolored noshow underwear,0
it fit well until it was washed a couple of times,0
fabric nearly paper thin transparent its ok for a beach cover up but its below my expectations it held up in washer on fragile cycle not to be worn for eventsjust poor quality,0
i bought this on impulse for our trip to mexico when it arrived i was pleased to see that it was indeed packable without losing its shape but i wasnt crazy about the fit the little leather band kept wanting to come off and the hat didnt look right without it so i kept putting it back on i only wore the hat once or twice because of the way it fit good thing it didnt take up much room,1
i love the size and style of this bag however i wish the zippers were better quality as they do not unzip smoothly and with ease rather they get stuck often,1
nice colors size as expected so far wearing well without cracking or loosing fur,2
videoidd9312b198aafed3a0cbf5284a38a45f3 i like the quality and fit it will be perfect to wear under my formal gown for our upcoming costume party,2
these are very comfortable solid and wellpadded ive been buying new balance walking shoes for yearsthe id numbers may change but the shoe remains a remarkably good buy for those who cherish their feet,2
wallet was darker than expected but it is very well made,1
looks good,2
as for checkbook covers it was exactly what i needed love it,2
i needed an extra bag and bought this based on the reviews and measurements the bag was way too smallstraps not as expected but you get what you pay for rather than send the bag back i gave it to my daughter she puts her extra items in here for school usually her breakfast coffee cell phone and earbuds for her technology class,1
first pair of basketball shoes and she loves them they make her jump higher and got her first basket in a game haha very comfy she says get at least a half size larger though glad i did,2
did not have the heft i would of expected with a nice watch also way to confusing to set,0
nice material but does not fit right makes you appear much larger than you are,1
super cute and super small but totally retro awesome earrings for an great price super cute for clubs and parties i try to wear them as much as possible,1
these are pretty but the earings are a little bit bigger then i thought the necklace is perfect sized i havent worn them yet im it sure if im keeping them for myself or giving them away for a gift ill update my review if my opinion changes after being worn by myself or someone elsebr shipping did take awhile bc they come from china but i knew ahead of time and i did receive them 3 weeks sooner then the estimated end date,1
dress was see through could not even wear white under it,0
i had a very similar item but the snap broke making it unusable this one is stronger and has two snaps plus a strap that flods over the entire perfect i simply love it and have received many compliments on it as well,2
i referred to the size chart and chose a size small since my waist size is about 242534 and i felt like this was a bit too tight additionally im very petite and i felt like the thick bands were not extremely flattering on mebr br i will add that the material and quality overall of this item is fantastic the clips are solid the straps are durable and the garter feels like its strong and wont rip easily,1
i purchased these shoes because they were recommended after foot surgery my foot hurt worse in these shoes than it did the day after surgery the sole pressed right on the area where the screws are in my bone no other shoe has done this my foot hurt so bad,0
good quality perfect in every way,2
excellent service and beautiful product bracelet as described i would of liked it a bit bigger however still very pleased,2
poor quality,0
keeps me toasty warm and looks good too,2
these are the most comfortable flip flops i have ever owned i have 3 pairs and will buy more,2
i wear size 10 clothing and the size 6 panties were perfect,2
once loaded with a normal amount cards and cash the wallet is too thick to foldbr needs to be taller instead of longerbr the extra bill slot is completely un needed and jist adds the the unnecessary thicknessbr im returning itbr its not for me,0
they arent the best quality material however i loved them and wore them i sized up after reading the reviews and wish i hadnt i wouldve been fine in my real size but overall they were cute and i got a lot of compliments on them,2
looks like my four year old spray painted it not worth a dime,0
pretty nice looking watch but seems really over priced the moon phases is a cool addition but its a lot more convenient to just look up the phase on your phone also a lot larger than i expected,0
the design is adorable the ring is holding up pretty well with the exception of the stones four of them have fallen out,1
they did not fit way too tight and was too short for my foot,0
i loved these soft warm pants liners but after 10 months and less than a dozen wearings they have developed multiple small holes i laundered them carefully and do not have moths i tried to contact the company but they have not yet responded,0
this shirt was ok it fit kind of large on my daughter she is 4ft11 and to me it looked kind of large it was made from that material that if you didnt wash first in heavy fabric softener it would itch you to death also it does on stretch or give the crochet lace made it hard to put on with fingers and jewelry getting caught in the loops it was way too small for me to wear being over weight my granddaughter is about in between us both and wore it fine but was still too long on her this shirt is not 34one size fits all or fits most category34 didnt have a to big of wow factor with us but it was still passable for a medium builtbr br i received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my unbiased honest opinion i am in no way affiliated with the company that makes and or sells this product the thoughts and opinions here are my own and i never guarantee a favorable review,1
gifted,1
wayway too small was very disappointed,0
i am giving it 2 stars because the price is cheap and if you need a cute dress for a costume this may work in a pinch however there was weird stitching in the inside back of the dress running perpendicular to the zipper it was about 4 inches of loose thread stitched this way over a good portion of the zipper this caused the zipper to frequently get stuck there were also loose threads everywhere on other parts of the dress i am returning,0
got this for my son for xmas he likes it and wears it often very thin though and the belt doesnt stay tied,2
this is the best watch band replacement ive ever run into it was so easy to install because of the slides on each end took me three times as long to take the old watch band off my watch then it did to put the new band onbr br now i dont have to buy a new watch,2
grand daughter loves it,2
the symbol is blurry and not even really there,0
this design is useful even it was cover my eyes i can still see everything clearlybr and the price is 95 for each cheaper than othersits worth it,2
changes my mood when i put it on makes me want to do the soul train strut,2
i was excited about receiving the shorts the shorts are nice but they bunch up at the front and looks like i have a diaper on maybe going up a size might work but am hesitant because of the style i may get a medium i usually buy size small for all shorts,1
i ended up returning this jumpsuit it just didnt fit well overall and i also didnt know it wasnt a full pant the pant stops just above the ankle,0
i bought this as a top to wear with jeans as pictured but it is actually the length of a dress it comes down to my knees and i am 5534 it is cute if i wanted to wear as a dress but i am looking for a off the shoulder top it is a little see through but i dont think you would have to wear a slip under it,1
my husband is a die hard packers fan and totally loves this shirt fits great,2
the kimono is really good quality and so is the demon slayer corps uniform the things on the calves idk what theyre called were sliding down a little bit but everything else was perfect none of the color is faded either,2
color is just like in the picture,2
i bought a few pairs of these socks in the summer from bath and body works to keep on hand for upcoming birthdays along with small bottles of lotion and they made perfect inexpensive gifts i also got some for myself they are so soft and so cute everyone i got them for loved them so much and then i ran out when another birthday came along a woman i know with cancer i was really wishing i had more of these but bath and body works wasnt carrying them since summer is over so got them from amazonthey arrived super fast just in time for her birthday and with some of the lotions i had they were a perfect gift for a cancer patient and since she is from the caribbean the scene makes them even more special,2
forgot i had a bra on when got ready for bed it is the best bra ever,2
this is a cute dress i liked it i thought it was flattering i thought the fit was pretty good i thought that it was unique and looked goodbr br the dress was relatively comfortable the fit was okay it wasnt too hot which for me is important since we live in floridabr br it wasnt too hard to clean i thought it seemed trendy it felt durable and the fabric was relatively soft it would work in a wide variety of settings,2
adorable but ran a little small order one size up,2
this dress is exactly what i wanted it is perfect for going to the store and other casual events it defiantly is more comfortable then wearing active wear to run errands,2
nice and comfortable bracelet but gold on clasp literally peeled off upon unwrapping,1
purchased in two colors a nice bit of whimsey,2
wish they offered different lengths but fits good on the body,1
the sweater was fine until i washed it lots and lots of fuzzballs that now must be trimmed off of the sweater,0
this shapewear is awesome soft very comfortable this is an awesome stage 1 faja similar to the one you leave your doctors in after lipo but way cuter im 510 got the 3x and im able to add my foams and boards feeling very compressed love it just ordered the black in a 2x as i get smaller around the waste the smaller in size ill buy great purchase,2
i luved that it was so brite colors so vibrant the cats all over it was sumthing iv never seen before she got so many compliments,2
pockets are too long must have used the wrong model pockets when you put something in them they ride past the bottom of the short nuisance and it looks awful cant have pockets longer than the shorts lolbr my 5 anthems are awesome they didnt get these right,0
to large material very good i think should order 1 size lower,1
no fumes beautiful,2
does exactly what its supposed to though it appears you just have a blackhead,2
fits 2 sizes smaller than the tag reads disappointed,0
sleeve length was awkward the fit was super boxy very loose as expected but created a very large bulky silhouette didnt drape well at all returned for refund,0
i found this a really efficient water backpack i hardly write reviews but this deserved onebr what i really like about it is that it has a lot of space and yep it looks really nice besides the pocket for the water bladder it has two zipper pockets between them there is a compartment with hook and loop fastenerbr there are also two mesh pockets on sides of the backpack on top if it there is a detachable extra pocket to carry things like your keys card id money and phone it has a waist strap and chest strap both adjustable to help support the pack and keep it in placebr the water bladder holds 2l of water i was concerned it will leak or will be difficult to refill but nope super easy to refill and no leakage whatsoever the hose and mouthpiece have quick release buttons on them so you can take everything apart and clean it the mouthpiece also has a cover on it to keep it cleanbr if you hike run go to the park with kids or spend time outdoors this is an awesome hydration backpack,2
not4me,1
great size and overall length,2
the chain is missing so now i have to spend more just for a chain to the chained wallet,1
the color was not the shade described nor anything like in the picture what i received was more of a milky see thru white not what i was expecting it did come with a nice bag to put in but will be returning it since it doesnt coordinate with my dress,0
ok level,1
i should have ordered a larger size,1
it was very tight in spots and very loose in others poor quality,0
letters were too close together and overlapped was not the letter styling i expected,0
i loved the shoe and it looked great on but the right shoe started coming off my foot as i tried to walk after only wearing them for a day made it very difficult to walk,0
the best way to describe this shirt is its like wearing a box i love the shape of the sleeves and the color but the shirt is so boxy the top does not lay as pictured i also found no way to fix this either by tying the shirt or tucking it in,0
they hurt my feet,0
bought these dresses for bridesmaids everyone loved them super comfy and super cute a really nice dress especially for the price seem to fit as expected,2
nice looking shirt but was too small for my son,1
looks nice is crap,0
actually i never got a chance to use them when i was in alaska in january no one would let me on the ice covered walks cant blame themmy balance was not the greatest at the time but maybe i will use them in the future or one of my grandchildren will,1
doesnt fit right around the eyes totally not comfortable poor quality,0
the style is exactly what i was looking for it is an allmatch and musthave shirt so i can wear it to create different styles i have to give it a fivestar because the texture of the martial is surprisingly soft and silky,2
love the earrings loook more costly and can be worn for casual as well as dressy,2
fit great looks great and has lasted months i have bought more since this first one and love them,2
very soft,1
great pair of athletic pants great fit very comfortable good price really like the way these fit and feel,1
fit as expected cuter in person,2
videoidb365a5ba465ebfdf7248d58280855c4e i love love mine great value,2
to small,0
although she doesnt know it this is a christmas present to me from my wife i will be totally delighted with it a very nice jacket for the price i am a great christmas shopper when it comes to gifts from my wife to me,2
was way too big and didnt look as nice as the picture,0
smaller than expected would not buy again,0
the clear bands fit most sizes but arent very attractive not sure how long they might hold up to daily use but there are three pair per pack,1
i saw this necklace and thought it was so darling i got it for my granddaughter in the green and yellow i looked at the reviews and saw the pictures that people had taken and i felt confident in buying one well it came and i was beyond disappointed the pops of enamled color that make it stand out so well was almost completely absent from the one i got if you really look you can see a slight bit of green but the yellow and red are pretty much not there i dont know if the one i got somehow got left out of part of the coloring process i was just sad it wasnt beautiful like the picture shows its still a cute necklace and she liked it but then she hadnt seen the online picture of what it was supposed to look like i cant really recommend this one since i dont know how likely it is for someone else to get one that seems to be only partially painted too bad because it could have been so much cuter,1
beautiful bracelet the links are kinda bigbut they are shiny and stay that way i dont take mine offso they go through washing dishes showers etc and are still looking like new 2 months later,2
dress was way shorter than picture i purchased 2 size large and extra large you must have big boobs to fit dress the cups were so offnow that i want to return the dresses the seller has stated i can only get 12 of what i paid thats insane nowhere on there does it state buyer beware,0
runs large the material is poor quality,0
love the fabric on these yoga pants they are stretchy and soft and very comfortable the waistband feels looser than a lot of similar pants and i was concerned that it might not stay up i havent had any issues with it rolling down its actually more comfortable because of the looseness these fit me a little tighter in the thigh area than most of my other yoga pants but overall im very pleased with them,2
love these for running hold my shoes tight and i dont have to worry about them coming undone,2
cheap rough see through overpriced,0
very small sized for teenagers i can usually count on allegra k sizing out of 5 orders this was the only disappointment,0
planned to wear it to a breed specific dog show but not that nice although the shirt is an eddie bauer it is shockingly poorly made the color is beautiful but shirt is skimpily sized thin and cheap looking the embroidered dog emblem does not look like the breed i selected and is also very cheap looking,0
these are pretty comfortable but after about 1 week of wearing them i noticed that the sole has a tear in it,0
i write this after i threw away all my 50 70 and 76 costco socks and bought 7 3packs of all different brands of 80 merino socks three of the sets were dark colored and all 3 wore and washed better than the light colored socks cozie and alsiada are the worst 80 socks yet the most advertised and poppedup by amazon spend 1799 for the dark weaves and get a better elastic woven in,2
i love this hat i like anything star wars if you are a star wars fan i encourage you get this hat,2
personally didnt like these they gave my son a blister where the round litte bit attaches to the back strap on his foot ive known other kids who had this pair and they didnt have a problem,0
looks nice,2
get this bra if you like your girls spilling out this bra is not for large chested women,0
i have not used this cream before so i dont know whether i got a bad jar or whether this is a bad product it is very dry and sticky very hard to apply to the boots i grew up riding horses so have spent a lot of time cleaning polishing conditioning leather boots this stuff is a mess it does not rub in it leaves small lumps all over now that it has dried im supposed to brush off the excess and buff but the lumps and excess cream will not be moved by any means it has formed a hard coating like paint which cracks where the boots bend and flakes off my boots are overlyshiny where they dont bend and look like they have mange where they do bend honestly im about to take my dogs for a long walk in a wet meadow and hope it just all comes off save your money do not buy,0
buy one size larger just to be sure they are holding up well comfortable but not super comfy,2
consbr br so these are weird in a bad way these screw apart both from the front of the earring and the back so it breaks down into three pieces eachbr br if you dont have strong fingers this means youll need pliers to hold the post the piece that actually goes into your ear and unscrewscrew using either the front piece or the back piecebr br i have no idea why someone would design them this way but clearly this has been this way for a long time and no one is willing to redesign thembr br ive only had them a few hours and already fed upbr br some of them are very hard to screw togetherbr br one of the crystals is placed slightly off center but i doubt anyone will notice unless theyre looking for itbr br prosbr br theyre solid feel nice and are just the right amount of heavybr br they look nicebr br the price is decentbr br overall i cant recommend them but i would not say avoid them either if it werent for the screw issues with the backfront i would have given them 4 stars maybe even 5,1
for a womens xl this fits barely like a womens l tight in the arms shoulders and chest and i normally wear a 12 or 14 its a pretty pattern and the cut is cute but the sizing is way off,1
everything is good,2
the neck line is all wrong not really a v very very wide neck line looks bad,0
its cute just buy 2 sizes up doesnt fit to size,1
i had to return weird fabric smells and its so small in the elastic that i couldnt get it on,0
returned it cheap material and way to low cut,0
this would be five stars but it killed me ordering this for my step mother since im an ole miss fan she better love me overall this is a great product and great service absolutely no problems and it shipped quickly very happy with this product except it being alabama,2
big dragon ball fan so decided to order the hat looks and feels well made delivery was fast looks just like the picture no complaints,2
wish i knew thats its not 22mm all around maybe i didnt read it disappointed that it tapers down to 18mm will be returning great quality for the price of that thats what youre looking for if it was 22mm all around id keep it for sure but i cant do 18mm,0
like someone else said in another one star review most of these 5 star reviews posted within few days in august 2016 are fake i bought the product and got it one with loose buckle the product would have been good if it was assembled properly note that the width of the belt is more than normal us standards i am returning mine as i cant use it anyway i would have kept it if i could fix the buckle the packaging was impressivebr br update i was able to fix the buckle by tightening the fallen screw in the box looks better now except it is bit hard to wear with some pantsjeans with smaller hoops,1
i am 53 125lbs and usually wear a size 5 these fit me perfectly and looked so cute on,2
i love this top ordered it in another color nice quality and thickness to the fabric a great goto casual top,2
this was a gift and the spyglass pendant was larger than expectedbr and the chain was cheapit was actually broke when receivedbr in the mail i had to buy a new chain at the last minute to give as abr gift,0
disliked how much it shed glitter everywhere,0
love this dress,2
this pajama set is soft and comfy but the material is very thin and cheap one wash and they tore disappointed because they will notbr last long,1
size chart is not valid,0
dont waste your money it showed up with a rip already in it pockets are either inconvenient or fake not the least bit warm lining in hood does not extend throughout body,0
very much just your average shoe not flashy not comfortable for long walks but they look good,2
its ok,2
i like the top usually have no problem all fitting into xl size tops at times they can even be too large however this is rather tight i love the fabric style and look of the top so im using it as incentive to lose a little weight so i can wear it on a cruise we have scheduled in nov 2017 well sea haha,2
completely different dress arrivedbr only similarity was color,0
they didnt appear to be flip ups so i had to return them,0
bought this for my wife who served in the usaf she loves it she has a small head the hat is adjustable fits perfectly great for warm weather,2
i wanted to love this watch i really did the watch loses a couple minutes throughout the day and the band feels more like a cheap plastic for the price you pay for an invicta watch you can easily purchase something much more reliable like a casio timex or even seiko,1
its crap not warm at all im a real person who works in a real factory wouldnt waste my money on it again,0
only three snaps and hood doesnt detach,1
i got this tshirt for my husband he always likes funny graphic tshirtsbr br he likes this one and it fits well,2
it is not a true large,1
ok ill fess up i really hate these kind of shoes the whole birkenstock thing was huge with a select group of people in the 80s and now that its coming back around it seems everyone is wearing these lol but my sister loves them so i got these for her they are spot on with her leopardsequinspink hair vibe she loved them squealed they are truly funny if youre not a fan with the leopard and fur so over the top but if you are a fan you will adore them,2
lightweight and kind of flimsy feeling but held up to a 6yr olds bday party,2
i have a 30 inch bust and dd breast and ordered and xs it was huge on me terrible sizing,0
i am disappointed that there is so little quality control i had purchased the same brand and style number in a different color a month before and love it this shirt arrived and is 34 inches longer i wanted the same length as the first,0
didnt fit in the diameter,0
returned,0
didnt work,0
it may not be the hats fault it may be my shape head face etcbr br i looked a tad silly in itbr br i thought this hat would be attractive to wear when im out walking the navy color would look good with jeans or navy pants which i wear a lot and the hat would keep the sun off of my facebr br it looked okay on me but i think my ny yankees hat is more flatteringbr br thats subjective this may look great on youbr br its a good weight,1
bought this for my family reunion as we were assigned colors for each branch got tons of compliments on this cute dress fabric feels soft and comfy like a big tshirt and fit just as id hoped it would im actually honking of ordering it in different colors too,2
not exactly what i expected,1
all the gems giggle not secure,0
i machine washed mine and most of the color of the gems washed off i might has well have just brought a mask with clear gems,0
it was flimsy wouldnt stand up very disappointed,0
i am very impressed with the quality and design of this necklace it was priced just right and shipped fast and i received it before the expected arrival day,2
nice one that is great for most women however a bit thin,1
love the shirt i read the comments before purchasing so i knew to size up i normally wear a med or large but ordered a 2xl very happy with the fit will be great for halloween and a workout shirt after,2
purchased this quartz keychain less than three months ago and just realized today the quartz crystal is missing the silver chain remains but the crystal fell off and is nowhere to be found very disappointed poor quality would not recommend,0
these work out shirts arebr comfortable during work out fit wellbr br im 58 170 medium was perfectbr br i purchased them for use with peloton home gym use you dont even know your wearing a shirtbr br my 24 yo liked them we bought set forbr him as well,2
the bracelet looks cheapbig stones and cheaply made,1
these sleeves do actually cool your arms absolutelybr they are however made of chintzy material and dont stay all the way down to your wrists as a one size fits all itembr do not try to use them to keep warm they really cool the arm skinbr for the price though i can justify the purchase,1
true to size and soft but super thin and worst of all the legs do not stay put they actually roll up oddly i do not recommend,1
bad quality,0
way too small i wear a large and ordered an xl fits more like a smallmedium definitely not an xl i wanted something loose fitting not short and skin tight,0
not worn daily so i was disappointed when i found the heel had separated from the shoe to the sole one would hope that this brand would last longer after occasional use disappointed,1
love these bags everything is so organised very useful should have bought years ago,2
,2
the sandals were very lightweight which was great the top straps of the sandals were elastic bands that stretched to fit your foot i found the elastic bands tight and left indentation on the top of my feet i have a small bunion on my right foot the stretch bands covered the bunion and caused pain i have had other sandals such as sketchers with stretch bands that were comfortable on top of my feet the sole on the sandals was very soft and comfortable as a reference i am 55 tall and weigh 165 lbs i returned the sandals,1
i love it,2
cute and good for the price arrive early as expected,1
i really wanted to like this wallet and after pretty light use over 45 weeks the stitching started to come undone to the point that it is now is now going in the garbage of course it lasted long enough that it can no longer be returned if youre looking for a wallet keep looking and avoid this one,0
i wanted to clarify that this is a lanyard for cards or keys you could use the loop to hold a mask but thats not really what these were designed for i work in a school so i use these as the keys to different areas the different colors help me remember which key is which they are well made think thicker ribbon fabric theyre durable and a good price for 3 of them,2
looks much nicer in the pictures and it fits too large it should stretch to fit and these were floppy,1
my hubby had me return this because there wasnt enough pockets also he was afraid the id insert would get separated and lost,1
great product,2
these are cute but super uncomfortable and hard to get on and off i like wearing boots as a break from pumps for the comfort and stability but these are worse than most of my pumps im going to try some inserts,1
i love vero modo and was sad that they stopped shipping to the us when the pandemic started so i was ecstatic to come across these pants since i have an old pair from when i lived in denmark however these pants are very long compared to my old pair which sucks because if they werent so long i would of kept them,1
it just didnt fit,0
i return these for the money they were cheaply made and i could get them for less as part of an outfit,0
product does not match the described color at all all advertisement photos show a tiffany blueturquoise what came is a baby blue with lavender tones does not look at all seen online,0
workmanship on the placing of the cz arent laid evenly you can see the the gaps in the top,0
i love these shoes my daughter hates socks and shoes however she walks already and needed something on her feet she loves these she doesnt even notice something is on her feet will be ordering more in the same brand,2
size large is loose wont buy again,1
it was not 34 sleeved otherwise fit fine,0
these are great they fit well and feel awesome cant wait to hike in them they have padding in all the right spots and should be perfect,2
never lose a glove again a must have for kids that are in school and always seem to lose a glove,2
this dress is pretty the material is heavy but not too heavy however it really runs small i mean way too small some will be blessed with a great dress,0
i really like this it is very nice quality long and the fit is flattering but the sleeves are really short it is odd because everything else fits like expected really bummed to return,1
classic knit construction but a little light and breezy,2
this bag came a little more orangecolored than expected but its perfect for a work laptop bag i have used it for the last couple weeks and i love it my laptop fits in perfectly as well as other papers and folders the quality is great for basic use,2
i am a small girl and even on me this bra is small tight and not comfortable for all day wear at all imagine being a size 2 and being sent a size 00 thats what this bra feels like on my like im being squeezed not flattering at all either because it runs small so instead of adding cleavage it squeezes you yikes,0
exactly what i was looking for at a good price nice traditional assortment of patterns have held up well through a lot of use good value,2
37 days later and i can say they have great marketing and a really terrible belt its nice that its cheap but i wouldnt recommend it to anyone,0
the dress looks nice the fabric just isnt what i expected its thicker than what i thought and it has a glossy pattern in the top it does fit nicely has nice shape,1
the only thing about this kit that turned out well were the ears there was no tail included and the collar and cuffs are way too small for any normal adult,0
unfortunately these are kind of a bust i wore them a few times to the gym but i like a thicker more compressive workout legging like fabletics powerhold i will have these on hand as a backup but theyre not a favorite of mine,1
cheaply made smells of resin and the material resembles eva form theres blue marks on the shoe as if it was touched by a maker or someone careless with paint i think im sending it back,0
i loved the material super fresh and smooth however it runs a bit big which i would have been ok with but the strings are too long and one is longer than the other side,1
its a very elegant necklace my only problem was that the earrings did come with the backs i also didnt like all the pins it came with to hold the necklace in place it hazardous i pricked my finger,1
i have had some issues with my hands and was looking for earrings i could put on and take off without help these were perfect as they go into my ear easily and the cliplike backing is easy to manipulate i love the look too as these earrings are just the right size for me they are beautifully simple and i like wearing them,2
i ordered these in two colors they arrived quickly the clarity on the tortoise pair was somewhat distorted in the nonbifocal area and one side of the black pair twisted when putting them on and taking them off,1
fit was off too big and printing was poor,0
the watch did not hold up it broke in 3 weeks could be better,0
did not look or fit as pictured could possibly just be me but it was too short and boxy very soft thin silky like fabric and very clingy i returned,1
fit perfectly worked great for what i needed it for sad that it didnt come with the boot covers like in the picture my daughter loved it and she looked so cute for her school performance,2
shorts look great and are very comfortable especially on hot days they dry quickly and fit true to size for me however after wearing them only three or four times ive developed a hole in one of the front pockets i would give them 5 stars if they were more durable,1
i only received gold and silver and all the pieces werent there i only received a total of 8 keychains,0
fits way to big cheap material,0
if you have pets or lint or live anywhere that isnt hermetically sealed dont bother buying this they are major lint and hair magnets,1
the earrings look exactly as pictured online quality is very good,0
i like this ring but it catches on everything,0
these gloves are excellent for use with glomittsbr br the sensitivity is as others have mentioned sometimes better than an actual finger and wont smudge the screen careful if you have velcro anywhere on your person because these gloves will stick and tear slightly if you can avoid touching velcro the gloves should be durablebr br in terms of insulation they are fine for 40 to 50 degree weather but anything less you will want to wear something over them,2
was a gift and they said there great,2
very cute dress im 510 165lbs and got the medium its form fitting but fits well cant wait for warm weather to wear it,2
beautiful color is amazing the side is smaller than stated i had to give it to my daughter cause it was too tight,2
guys this looks like an old faux crushed velvet pajama shirt its hilarious do not buy this although i got a good laugh its going back it runs really small if you like the faux crushed velvet look so size up it was too awful to take a picture to post,0
absolutely loved this coat very warm and cozy,2
seriously great value fit nicely and decent quality,2
cheaply made i didnt see a size chart so i assumed it had an adjustment on the back like most hats do never assume,0
i bought for a friend with wide calves,0
great comfort,2
fit is good but the cage detail on the arms is a little sloppy looking and the ruby color is not as shown its bright primary red rather than a wine color,1
i ordered in gray love it the khakicream color pockets are way too low will be sending back,0
very comfy,2
great shirt but i might have gotten fatter,2
good price and overall quality of material had a tendency to slide off heal at times but great none the less,2
they sparkle so much more in person one of my go to pairs,2
feet still hurt and squeaks when i walk in these,1
too big for a kid and to expensive for the material,0
these are super cute and fit well however i wouldnt recommended working out in them while they are not see through they show all sweat marks i am keeping these for leisure wear and enjoy them cause they are cute and fit well,1
the waist line wasnt quite long enough for me im 53 was about 125 lbs at the time i purchased this dress the material was a little thin the length was just above my knees i returned this dress because just wasnt suited for me,0
i love this tank top fits just right,2
i just needed a new one love this hat,2
this are very soft and fit pretty comfortably but one wash and the elastic is coming out at the top do not recommend,0
my family and i like it very much thank you very much,2
i did not know the product was mesh like in its fabric i thought it was going to be a solid material and im honestly pretty disappointed about that i would not have made the purchase if i knew that its quite difficult to see in the pictures posted just feel sad about it,0
very light material and sizes run small returned moving on,0
i ordered small i am 50 and 130lbs fits tight from the arms not like the picture shows it where its loose from the arms its short recc size up for a loose fit,0
holds up well but due to the band thickness much thicker on top than expected to accommodate the setting runs a bit small,2
i am 57 130lbs 34b 26 waist 37 hipbr br i ordered navy lxlbr br it was too big even with the tie in the backbr br i will be ordering a sm in the futurebr br the fabric is extremely soft and comfortablebr br the color is gorgeousbr br the embroidery is beautifulbr br the length of the dress is perfect it brushes the top of my feet without any shoes onbr br i will be ordering more in the futurebr br i recommend this to anyone,2
the color and feel of the fabric is very nice,0
yes nice,1
videoidc15d8b24f3b1f4aaa4bf5e363382032e this looks nothing like the picture its a gold sequin nightmare the seams dont line up it feels like an old cheap quilt its basically an overpriced wish version of the pictures,0
well its really nice however i didnt get a chance to enjoy it after 1 day of use the smaller balls came loose later i noticed that the larger ball had a crack in it so i couldnt never tightened it was at the thread of the barrel i wrote the company a complaint i got no response bach not that i expected them to respond i actually choked on the ball the company got paid there not worried about if youre given reviews or rate them,0
good quality but are more red than burgundy,0
first i really like these socks and will almost certainly order more theyre a nice quality with the smoothest seams ive ever seen in socks theyre softer than expected and a nice medium weight for use as an everyday boot sock theyre super comfortable to wear and can be worn up or folded over and at less than 5 a pair theyre a great value on the flip side the product description is a little misleading these socks have some wool in them but not a lot so they dont provide the warmth expected from wool socks they also arent thickthese are a medium weighti wouldnt wear these on really cold or snowy days and the inside of the socks arent fuzzy as advertised or as found in heavy duty winter socks i do like these socks they just arent what i expected,2
i am a 1416 and i hot the xxl and the bust is small but the waist fits the button holes are way to small will have to modify the sleeves are so baggy and long i will have to take it to a tailor not sure what the material is but it is light weight glad i didnt spend too much given the alterations that will have to be made,1
i was disappointed in the small size i think my baby will outgrow it in a month but it is cute,1
husband loved costume but doesnt like to wear masks so he cut out the face piece and i face painted him for comfort my husband also put a couple stitches on the separate hat so it attached to the head piece,2
really cute definitely runs large so id recommend sizing down the back has elastic which give you a little more flexibility with the fit,2
dont want to get gross but my product was clearly used definitely smells like it was worn and return dont want to be gross but its going back it also came in what appears to be a zip lock bag that was crumbled and used looking see pic,0
horrible dont work,0
a bit tight must be chinese sized order a size larger if available,1
i just received this item love it im 55 200 very curvy with a slight muffin top and the xl fit great showed the right curves and hid the muffin top ill prob put on s thicker belt but it fits great material feels great and it fit me like the pics of the product,2
the soles are very comfy but something on the strap rubs so i cant walk for a long time in them,1
i really like this piece though in retrospect i dont have many other items to wear with it choose a rose gold piece without little rhinestones if your lifestyle is more casual,1
my grandson said it fit like bike shorts not good,0
son loved it,2
i received the lacer quickly and was able to replace my shoes within five minutes,2
this dress looked so damn cheap,0
love this sweatshirt i wear it all the time love the metal zipper soft on the inside i lost my first one and immediately bought another,2
these sneakers do not use breathable material and last only a few weeks i would spend more next time and get better quality breathable sneakers,1
its super cute but the material is very cheap and will probably hold together for a few washes fit is good and i love the style but again the material is not great,1
i like these would recommend these they are very pretty,1
very pleased with the size quality price of this luggage set arrived well packaged and undamaged,2
you get 10 of these suckers useful for those polygamy relationships or you can be like me and go through exwives like ihop does with pancakes had a qalo ring for years and lost it 2015 easter colection neon yellow so i bought this because it had the same color these rings are more squareish than qalo but does the job amazingly,2
if you have breasts forget it plus the top runs very small i ordered an xl and it fits ok however i am an usa size 68 hardly an xl this is an asian xl also this top is very sheer you will not be able to go to work without wearing a camisole underneath factor that into the fit as well i dont know why designers continue to make sheer tops like this for women its insane are we really supposed to walk around with sheer tops crazy only flat chested and very skinny women are going to like this top,0
great shoe seem to run about a size big in comparison with my other shoes,2
i bought this for my 13 year old for her birthday and now i want one i love this material and the way it wears,2
i was super disappointed with this product it had zero stretch zero control and it ripped apart within 2 hours of wearing them there are definitely better out there,0
i love the color of this hat and its very comfortable to wear,2
extremely cheap tail looks bedraggled striping on tail is barely noticeable colors are off from the real cheshire cat and the headband was too small for my average sized adult headthough it fit my 3 year old well enough,0
good quality i bought it for my son my boy uses it very well,2
cute dress but its a little heavy it was also very short i am 5 10534,1
i got only item though i saw 2 in a pack,0
looks great,2
this is a nice quality fabric and seems like it would be durable the look and color was overall great however if you are a broad shoulder athletic build guy then this is not the shirt for you i am 510 190lbs with a 34 waist and bought a xl the shoulders fit well but fit blimpy everywhere else the waist and arm areas are a straight box fit positive side was that is fit my bicep area well but my forearm area was massive a large may have for better in the arms and waist but the shoulders would be too tight ended up returningbr br overall not the fit for me but may be a great shirt for a different guy with a different build,0
ive got a few different tungsten wedding bands that i rotate through and im glad to have added this one to my collection let me tell you why i love tungsten so muchbr price tungsten is one of the cheapest metals out there and you can easily get a quality ring for around 20 this ring in my opinion is severely overpricedbr hardness tungsten is the second hardest material known to man right behind diamond if you tried to cut it with a steel blade at 2000 degrees f you wouldnt make a scratch and speaking of scratches tungsten rings will never scratch in all the years you have them unless you try to carve at it with a sharp diamondbr shine tungsten has a natural shine to it that makes it perfect for mens jewelry it always keep its mirror finish but isnt so light and bright like silver the cool gun metal gray color of it makes it unique sophisticated and just looks badbr emergencies im a paramedic and ive cut off my fair share of rings working ems and in the emergency room when someone sustains enough trauma to their hand or find their ring can bend dent or jam around their finger which can cause serious damage cutting off a gold titanium silver stainless steel platinum or whatever other metal ring can be a difficult and annoying process for everyone involve worst of all if theres severe swelling and the ring isnt cut off quickly it could mean permanent damage or even loss of a finger while all this sounds terrible the worst injury associated with rings that ive seen is something called degloving google image it degloving is when the ring gets caught or snagged on something is on too tight or is causing the finger to swell and it pulls all your skin and fatty tissue off with it basically your finger is nothing but bone and some muscle afterwards which is disgustingbr enter tungsten none of these injuries are even possible with tungsten for one reason brittleness since tungsten is such a hard metal it will never bend dent or jam around your finger if enough force is applied to actually damage it the ring will simply shatter into a few large pieces causing absolutely no or very minimal damage to your finger and contrary to popular belief tungsten rings can easily be removed in an emergency situation simply tap on it from different angles gently with a hammer by applying these low impacts around the ring it weakens the entire structure and will eventually just break right off ive broken off a tungsten ring in less than 5 minutes before which is much faster than titanium or other hard metalsbr basically tungsten is a great metal and the blue inlay adds some character to it my wifes ring has a blue sapphire in it so its nice we sort of matchbr i received this product at a discount or free for my honest review you can check my profile and see i do not,2
fits tight order at least a size up the fabric is very thin but the colors are amazing and very bright its definitely what i would refer to as eye catching,0
great for the price,2
too small,0
it broke before i could wear it,0
i have a pair from a different seller that are better,1
if the band of elastic at the top of the cup wasnt so tight this would be 5 stars it cuts into the breast leaving a lump the bra fits fine otherwise,2
super soft and very cute but tight around the design area,1
meh,1
much smaller than it looks would not have purchased it if i saw the size before purchase,1
good for some but not for me the heal and toe area have extra padding as i said very good for some but made my cycling shoes a bit too tight i measure the small side of the small size but found these not to have enough compression i have other higher socks in which the compression is much better,2
did not like these i sized up to a size l and they still were too tight they are actually weird shaped not like in the photo,0
low quality thin fabric almost like paper boxy fit runs very large yet no stretch anywhere so its tough to get just the right fit,0
i had to send the bag back the strap had been cut at some point and a strip of light purple cloth had been sown over the cut the bag itself was promising small and just what i wanted but i didnt want a damaged strap,1
large does not fit a 36 ddd no coverage,0
selene womens one piece swimsuits one shoulder cutout monokini tummy control ruched bathing suitbr size large im 56 and 130 lbs i normally wear a medium but since this wasnt adjustable i ordered a large and it fits perfect i have a long torso toobr br the suit is very well made it is totally lined the pads are removable if you dont like them the one shoulder gives it a sexy look with the split in front but everything is still covered not sure how it would work if you are large chested but for smaller chested women it gives the illusion love this suit not too high in the back sexy but modest love highly recommend 5 stars hope you find this review and pictures helpful,2
love these shoes the arch support is great for walkingbeing on your feet my feet do not get tired even with walking all day and i have noticed that my knee which ocassionally hurt is no longer doing so i would recommend them they are pricey so i also appreciate that i can save some money on them by purchasing them from amazon,2
everybody note if you are buying this product from a seller other than amazoncom you might receive a fake productbr br i purchased from the seller called 101targets and received this products after one month since i am currently living in china it took about 8usd to transfer from us to chinabr br what i received looked quite different from a genuine product immediately i contacted the developer cocoon infococooninnovationscom and they said it was a fake product amazon has decided to refund me and i have reported this seller to their team for further investigationbr br if you have received your product please compare it with the picture on the description it should be a fake one if you findbr br 1 the organization of the front side is different from the listed picturesbr br 2 the back of the product is made of nylon and have a bag and chain on itbr br 3 theres a website on the instructions called griditcn which is actually a fake website i could not find any product there this is another evidence that i think it might be fakebr br the back of the product is different for most of you to distinguish since amazon does not provide its photos neither does the official website but i found it for youbr br the fake one the back is made of nylonbr the genuine one the back is made of leather,0
it looks a little cheep in person with the lace at bottom fits more like a maternity shirt,1
very comfortable true to size,2
my husband loves his new shorts he says they fit well and are really comfortable the size i got is a tiny bit small but he wont let me send them back he doesnt want to give them up,2
needs another inch to be comfy im hippy,2
very hot and the material is not very comfortable,0
the elbow patches didnt lay in the correct spot this was more robelike than an open cardigan,0
too heavy for me,0
i have received my braceletearly i will definitely be buying more products from them this bracelet is just adorable looks exactly like it does in the picture with a claw and chain for more size options,2
i still like it but fits nothing like model its shorter and is more like a cowlneck,1
great quality,2
disappointedbr plus columnbr comfortable and easy to put onbr love that it is not padded and bulky but lined enough to conceal nipsbr cons columnbr does not separate my boobs why is that so hard was great for about 10 minutes then they crept together to form uniboobbr very unflatteringbr br i had high hopes because it looked more structured than some wirefree bras the seam in the middle and the lining looked like they might give some shape to breasts no the underband rolled up and it provides no lift or support total waste of 12,1
tight in hips,1
replacement isnt working not sure if i return this one too or if there is something im doing wrong does it have a battery how do i add one of it doesnt,0
runs really small order at least 2 sizes larger than what you wear material is of good quality and its comfortable,1
im normally a 2x and thats what i purchased based on previous comments seemed a little short waisted however i am very happy with my purchase,2
its my goto hat for morning walks and heading out to the farmers market,2
they are a glorified pair of tights i bought the proper size but they look like tights mot substantial at all do not recommend,0
lol its ok,1
i do enjoy that it has pockets and the material and make feels sturdy just go with another color than the grey one,1
great quality and designs definitely recommend,2
its a cool looking corset and its dirt cheap but man that zipper does not want to hold in my luscious ample bosom its also a pretty flimsy zipper not one for a sassy dame such as myself but im also a poor sassy dame so whaddya gonna do i like the straps though the fabric is pretty cheap ill let one of my sortafriends have it cause its kind of a present kind of just offloading a cheapy steampunk corset,1
runs small clingy synthetic fabric,1
ordered for a wedding but never used they were very tacky gold and the strap was too small to go over my daughters foot which caused a large amount of white velcro to show regardless to say she will probably never wear them save your money,0
received just what i ordered they are very nice,2
one of the eyes fell off before it could even be worn,0
how nice to finally find a pair of kids ski socks that actually fit snuggly and arent all bulky in their ski boots,2
fits and looks cute on my daughtershes 53 and 125 and i think its a m its thicker than i thought and i liked that but its fairly cheap so i dont think itll last its a great fashion piece for a season or two though so im happy i got it,2
love it cheap durable and thin,2
why is this shirt displayed as if the sleeve and the body is tapered the sleeve and the body looks nothing like the shirt in person,0
i loved these but i normally wear a 2 ordered many items from amazon in size 2 ordered 3 in these and very low rise and could not even button them,1
i had ordered this bra before and loved it this one had those moulded bras that i really dont like its comfortable though i just prefer the softer version,1
bought this for my baby whose always taking selfies keeps it with her everywhere she goes but she has yet to actually use it she said she is waiting for right backgroundlol,1
super cute way to small,0
i buy boys shoes because ive always had wide yet small feet i like these shoes a lot excellent quality laces and a fun tab on the tongue to help pull it up not wild about the tab on the back above my ankle that pops up a bit but they have outstanding support my feet dont hurt when i get home from work i think i wore my last pair of nb sneakers a liiiitttle too long before replacing them would recommend these to everyone,2
the cross over decoration on the shoulders is not symmetrical one loop bulges up i suppose i can cut and stitch it down so it wont be awkward,1
i order a sm and my hips are 38 inches tried to fall of my hips at the end of the holes you cannot add holes to this belt too bad i got this for my skirts,1
i purchased this dress and absolutely love it it is casual when worn alone but can be dressed up with accessories a cardigan or jacket it is a great value for the price,2
i used this about three times and the third time one side kept sliding off i got my normal size b so i would suggest going up a size,1
strap is too long for my smaller daughter i am using two binder clips to hold the excess strap in a way that is comfortable for her also the bag is only usable on one side,1
ive been wearing altra shoes since lone peak 25 and have the torin 45 which are great fit well and have a supremely comfortable tongue system the torin 5 unfortunately changed the tongue system so that is hits right at the joint in the ankle especially during flexion of the foot the rest of the shoe fits will i hope they update the torin 6 with the 45s tongue,0
nice shoes but a little high on the instep,2
nice fabric comfortable fits well overall great i wouldnt mind buying another one in a different color,2
love this romper fits well without being really baggie i am big busted to i had trouble finding a romper that fit in the chest with out being oversized everywhere else great color too,2
they fit like low rise jeans and give my mom bod a muffin top nice length color material though,1
,2
weve had this band for less than 30 days and it ripped apart,0
fabric is so lightweight i actually was looking for something heavier the rayon feels cheap quality as well but what do you want for 20 bucks these days i kept them to wear under my belly dancing skirts and wraps they have good movement and range over all i guess it just depend on what youre ooking for,1
love these bras very comfortable well made and great support i have bought several will buy several more,2
they are very dark almost a dark chestnut brown black it is a hard match to my tigereye pendant and they look almost nothing like the product pictured,1
the reason for the 1 star is the threading on the pockets is of poor quality i had to use fabric glue to keep them from ripping every time i pulled them up every time i pull them up i hear a rip somewhere,0
this is not slim fit it is regular fit,2
good quality but small,1
jesus,0
beautiful bracelet but too hard to fasten on wrist poor craftsmanship not giftable,1
good fit and my heels dont slip around,2
very comfortable silky smooth material,2
the wallet overall is of good quality but i was expecting a much smaller version of this one too large for being minimal be sure you measure before you buy it i realized i wanted something the size of the business card wallet which is much more minimal,0
great quality,2
had to return just a tad to large would love to get another pair but i bought these on amazon prime day so no offer to exchange for the special price loved the look and feel,2
shirts were too big for a large the quality of shirt is great,1
i bought this for my boyfriend who is shorter but muscular than i am in an extra large it fit so snuggly that it was uncomfortable for him which he is a 34x30 at 56 so i am instead wearing it and it is snug on me as well im not sure ill get much wear from this since the pants barely reach my ankles now im 59 maybe purchase 2 sizes up instead of 1 size,1
the insoles tend to move around easily which means you have to readjust every time you put the shoes on this gets really annoying really fast,1
first off these earrings come in the coolest packaging its easy to open and keeps the air outbr br they are larger wider than i expected if you can see my photoif you have two piercings you might only be able to wear this pair alonebr br they are hollow but still seem heavier than most of my earringsbr br the silver tone is darker in these more like a stainless lookbr br they are different earrings and for the earring collector these will be a find,1
i returned this top the fabric is thin and clingy not what i expected,0
looks great,2
if you are a 1x like me dont try to buy a lxl like me it doesnt work ill give it to my daughter,1
was super excited to get it then i opened the bag and was greatly disappointed the picture is soooo misleading the charm is foggy in spots and scratched font isnt big nor is the background pretty i would not buy this again nor from the same company id rather pay 40 for a regular looking one than this misleading cheap thing,0
its still a cute hat but it is not anywhere near as cute and oversized as it is in the photo its almost the same size as a regular beanie ill still use it but i was a little disappointed,1
happy with the hat good fit,2
it was ok the waist seams are awkward and poke out on my hips the sleeves are very baggy not exactly worth 35,1
these didnt last too long with my daughter,1
i bought this for an undershirt so being lightweight is okay but if you want it for an outer shirt it is too lightweight,1
i wear an xl and this clearly was made for women with a small chest disappointed because i was looking forward to it and now i can return it,0
great addition to a matching jacket could not looked better and great price,2
size 10 fits slightly snug on my 10 year old the fabric feels like regular swimrashguard fabric has good neck protection and longer almost elbow sleeves great for swimming or water sports we later bought the 12 though and it is exactly the same size see photo green is 12 blue is 10 the sizing is problematic,2
this is a nice dresshowever i should have gotten an extra largebut will keep it,1
love the slim fit,2
so cute,2
i continually buy the superstars they have been one of my favorite shoes since i was teenager i have to wear an ankle brace with metal slats frequently and it is hard to find shoes that will fit it i usually buy all of my shoes 12 to 1 size too big my feet are different sizes as well due to multiple surgeries on one ankle i have never had an issue with the superstar they are very comfortable they last and they fit my brace would 100 recommend,2
the picture is deceiving when it comes to length the model must be very short because this dress doesnt come anywhere near my feet its just too short i am 5346 and expected to have a full length dress ugh,1
it was huge and the material was very heavy and uncomfortable,0
the charm was very pretty but the chain seemed cheap and was not long enough if i had kept this i wouldve gotten a more substantial chain for the charm,1
i used the size guide supplied but the pockets are far back on the seam and added the illusion of larger hips i was comfortable but needed to keep adjusting i have worn it so i will not return but i would have ordered an xl had i known 57 and about 180lbs,1
very thin material but waterproof,1
just what i needed,2
good product for the price,2
liked the shirt but doesnt fit very well ordered a large like the other ones ive ordered from here but it was a bit small,1
these are great authentic bdubr a bit long on length mid calf so ill hem them 2 inchesbr make great work shorts,2
i was so disappointed in the last two i bought i initially bought 3 and they were perfect i decided to purchase the exact same exact style and size shirt just different colors and these were comically huge i have 34 extra inches of material around my upper arms and the sleeves are so long i have to fold them 3 times to get to my wrists,0
cute heavier than i expected have gotten several compliments on them,1
the jewelry is pretty and inexpensive but they didnt stay in place well and my bridesmaids were adjusting the necklaces all night,1
very nice,2
very small,0
these are pretty and comfortable but the cups run small if you compare to vs braettes youll need 12 sizes up unfortunately the band may be too big then,0
it was a terrible dress the fabric was cheap and the skirt felt like a cheap throw away table cloth i was very disappointed because the picture looks so cute but the dress was like something off of wish,0
has buttons that keep buckle in place on belt and keep coming off,1
i will have to return this dress the material and quality are all ok but i had read some reviews mentioning it ran small i did not find that to be the case i should have ordered a medium i generally wear a 68 this was just too droopy at the bodice and im not particularly small busted,1
cute but ordered an xlg is about a size 68br gave it away,0
you pay what you get for cheap cheap cheap the pocket fell off already lol the material is very light almost like an under armor tshirt and the sizing is very small incredibly small,0
the hat came completely crushed flat in a soft bubble mailer envelope the shape will never go back to its original shape but i was able to bend it back as much as possible and its wearable,1
inside purse liners is ripped,0
the swim suit arrived shoved into the bag i opened to find a nasty stain right on the crotch area didnt even have a liner its a cute swimsuit but so nasty amazon,0
didnt fit like they were described nor were very flattering which was a big bummer not the greatest quality in craftsmanship as well returned these and purchased a different pair from a brand in familiar with instead,1
and no cupping for the heel these are a shapeless floppy pair of house loafers with a slip resistant bottom not sure whats special about the bottom that good sneakers dont have,0
gorgeous shoes but go up at least 2 to 3 sizes to get correct shoe size,1
i love these super comfy slippers ive used dearfoams for years and the last few have totally failed me plus customer service was completely nonexistent so i decided to try some others and these are a big win theyre crazy durable soft and cozy inside but a solid rubber sole for outdoor use i wear these on the back patio and front porch all the time,2
looks nice feels cheap the battery died right away,1
i ordered 3 sizes bigger like they say and they still dont fit and all are coming apart at the seams,0
i bought one of these black robes i think two winters ago and its still awesome my home gets pretty cold and this is perfect for letting me move around without suffering i started wearing it again recently and my boyfriend saw it and wanted one so i came back here and ordered it same size and color arrived ok but its not the same the fabric on mine is thickerwarmer this new one is made of something softer but thinner lighter and not as warm it looks and feels cheap to be honest like it wont last two winters i think it sucks when a company makes a good product and then starts skimping on materials but selling at the same price disappointed still an ok robe but probably not worth the price anymore,1
these are really inexpensive so perfectly fine as 34fun34 pair of shades but they feel clunky and like 10 glasses,1
very comfortable my second pair in fact great product,2
second time purchasing and love it very soft and high quality non skid bottom perfect for toddlers its so cute i wished they made it in adult size,2
a friend recommended compression socks but i was a bit leery about paying more than ten bucks for one pair of socks im more of a ten pair for ten bucks kinda shopperbr br i live in a cold part of the country and was afraid the compression would make me cold but it had the opposite effect i was comfortable and my legs felt pretty great even after the rest of me was beat from a looooong day at the craft fairbr br so im here to buy more,2
i usually wear a small in cardigans based on size chart i ordered medium maybe because of the cut of the neckline it came around my sides but not much in front i did not keep it due to fit the knit was very soft and eggplant color pretty i think it would be ok if you sized up quite a bit,1
exactly what i was expecting,2
grey cameo colorpattern is unique and works well with this style the 34nixon rhythm34 is a great 34tide34 watch as the chart takes up about 80 of the watchs visible surface but as far as telling time goesthe digits in the upper left hand corner are tiny like a 4 font and almost impossible to read without illumination day or nightbr br so a cool watch for a long day at the beach if all you are concerned about is riding tasty waves and you dont need to be anywhere at any time in particular,1
i dont know if this is a defectice pair or if this the poor quality of it the only thing i know is that i used them just once and the pictures show how the material is falling apart i wish to contact the seller and ask to replace it but i dont see this possibility i understand i could only return them which i cannot do because i am traveling tomorrow br very disappointed i contacted the seller and hope he will be able to replace them or refund me,0
its very comfortable and so easy to see,2
exactly as pictured but smells really bad,0
i wear an xl this was an xxl and i could hardly get it on,1
it is cute but the chain is cheep looking,0
i have a size large boutique shirt that is almost exactly the same design and it fits very loose i ordered an xxl in this top based on previous reviews and its still a little tighter overall not a terrible shirt but its not flattering,0
this is my 3rd same hoodie and i am sure not the last one it is water repellent and fleece inside but also it has ventilation as big holes around shoulders so you never gonna be wet,2
i ordered the magentapink and the red in a size medium the magenta fit like a small and the red fit a little looser im only 52 so the length on both was ok but the magenta one was pretty tight im a size d cup apple shaped and about 135 pounds with a little tummy which i try to hide i wish i could return the magenta one since it isnt flattering because it is so tight i do like the way both on them fit my boobs as it kind of holds them in a little for last minute lingerie that you arent going to be wearing for very long it works but for lounging around in i would size up for comfort i am usually a size 6 i might order the tealoff white one in a large if you are tall this is going to fit you like a tank top my torso is really short im mostly leg but again only 52 and the size medium was still really short on me,1
these socks run very large and seem to fit awkwardly too much fabric here to little there i have size 105 shoes and my feet swim in the large size,1
my son picked these glasses from eye doctor they were broken at school then we bought the frames on here because it was cheaper than eye doctor guess what they are now broken so my son has to go a few months without his glasses,0
hold plenty of watches and bracelets it just seems to move a lot its not 3 stationary rows but they move,1
love this anklet it actually fits me and has enough room to move around on my ankle which is surprising i wore it for about 3 weeks straight without taking it off until now bc it doesnt fit well under boots which is normalnot the anklets fault im very surprised it hasnt broken or tarnished i would definitely recommend this product to anyone and if anything happens to it which its likely ill lose it before it breaks im definitely going to buy another,2
the butt area is to small i had to give it away i have a small butt and it was still in my crack to much,1
this was a christmas gift for a nephew arrived a day early which was great coat is cool but it came with unexpected dirt marks down the front of the coat right out of packaging tried to lightly clean it as to not smear markings but it was a stain that was already set bummer just fyi for those wondering xxl is about a an xl in us sizes,0
the chain broke two days after receiving the product,1
i dont know if i shouldve ordered bigger but they seem to ride up in the butt like the material though and the front part,1
product seem used delivered with what seems to be dirt marks all over,0
the robe clung to me and was too small i threw it away cause i cant return it i am so disappointed,0
i got the olive green color they are flattering and arent see through they are a very thick material and are very warm i was hoping for a cool comfortable lounging material but these are too thickwarm and clearly for working out im sure the thickness helps make them squat proof,2
washed it once did not use the dryer and it didnt fit after the fabric feels like a thick gauze and i dont think it would hold up after a second wash,0
i will never again trust this product it was absolutely uncomfortable too small i am looked terrible,0
these look as good as raybans at a fraction of the cost they are super lightweight and the price was an excellent value for the money they protected my moms eyes completely when she had cataract surgery,2
they are a bit big if you have a small fee free this is not for you otherwise the product is good,1
great shoes amazing colors,2
i did not like this fabric it felt like plasticky cotton and had an odd shinebr br one of the least nice items ive received from yesno,0
after one time in the dryer 3 bells and one of the yellow puff balls came off had to sew them back on also dress runs a little small,1
it was perfect the item matches the color or the watch perfectly and makes it look brand new there are tools in the box but i havent had the need to use them to install it my plan is to sell the watch and i needed to update my tired band before i put it up online,2
these are manufactured overseas ee width equivalent to d width that you are used to buy one size larger then you normally wear tongue maybe 12 inch too short not as comfortable as old us made new balance that i remember quality seems reasonable otherwise,1
love it,2
i have these in several colors very comfortable,2
i love this ring but its just too large for my finger i measured and thought i was a 13 but would probably go 2 sizes smaller looks really nice,2
great shirt for recovery,2
gloves look nice and fit great however the pads on the palm are really not beefy enough if youre going out for a long ride more than 12 hour yes they are gel but just not heavyduty gel,1
you will not be able to put large earrings in these but they are pretty nice for organizing smaller sized earrings my daughter liked them,2
this top is really cute and very comfortable im 52 110 lbs with a short torso and this top in the xxs fits comfortably yet a little loose the tie and length still makes this top work well with regular waist pantsshorts as well as highwaisted overall i highly recommend the fit style and fabric 5 stars,2
condensation on the inside and phone was wet,1
the bust size was too small even though i purchased my traditional size,0
got this for my ginger bearded teacher brother who normally wears a medium but this was rather small he said he would try to stretch it out and wear it but i doubt he will the design was great and the shirt was nice but i would order at least one size up if not two from the size you normally wear it is going to shrink in the washer and dryer for surebr really wish it would have been something he could have worn,1
good buy,2
i love the bracelet this is well made head turner and it feels good on the wrist i would encourage anyone contemplating on purchasing just go ahead its a dope bracelet,2
the earrings are so dainty and sparkly they will be great for my second hole,2
i love bella canvas tees i make a lot of my own shirts and almost always use these they are so soft and hold up great im a large in womens and always order a medium in these unisex tees they fit great not too snug or too loose i always hang to dry so i havent had any problems with shrinking,2
i bought this for my 13 year old granddaughter shes 5 134 tall and weighs 106 lbs this was way too big the straps sagged it was very cheaply made it hit her right at the knee it fit very loosely my granddaughter picked it out and she was very disappointed she wont be wearing it for halloween id return it but i cant print out a return label,0
the shirt is pretty and seems well made but is very small i normally wear a large in this type of button down shirt and i couldnt even button the chest for reference i am a 38b i gave it to my mom who normally wears a smallmed and size 34b and it fit her fine,1
the top did not fit right had to reorder another size,1
this is a super cute super comfortable tank that when i wear it i have tons of ladies say how cute it is it wears and washes well and its a personal wardrobe fave,2
great beachware,2
confirm received,1
i got the size recommended by apple but it just felt too snug for me they do not make a larger sizebr besides being snug it went on easy and would be better on someone with a smaller wrist it felt great the first few hours but after awhile it just wasnt right for me,1
this dress is such a great buy it fits great looks great and is a great buy,2
it was too small for my head,1
these for perfectly and they are comfortable and light perfect for lounging around the house,2
i was thrilled to wear this skirt its very cute and flattering ive worn it a few times and washed it once but imagine my surprise when i took it off the other day to find the back seam completely ripped i didnt get it caught in anything i wasnt wrapped in it tightly at all since the loose fit below the waist is one of its appeal ive never ripped any pants or skirt before you can judge for yourself in the photos at least i got a couple months to enjoy it but its a bummer and not worth the money,0
very aesthetically beautiful but bend very easily would not encourage to buy,0
bout at the end of last year and have not used yet as of 122218 did fist as expected ill let you know how the durability is either at the end of the season or if it rips before thatbr br edit sorry for the lateness this thing ripped pretty quickly in the crotch area after like 1 jump the the next day one of the overalls popped so not worth changing it to 1 star,0
bought the pisces bracelet for my 17 year old daughter and she loved it it was very pretty and dainty looking but it broke after a month the pisces symbol split right in the middle and was beyond repair unable to return because it happened right after the return window closed which is a very small window if it didnt break i would have given this more stars because it really did look pretty when she was able to wear,0
great top good quality i bought a second in a different color my favorite every day tops i recommend it,2
i ordered a set of 5 pairs womens fuzzy socks cute animal winter slipper cozy socks christmas gifts for women for review these socks are a bit cheaply made i can not quite tell what animals is which the animals seem to been on upside down from where you would expect them to sit but honestly it is really difficult to tell they are not super soft and honestly we would not give these socks out as gifts soso quality with a confusing design,1
its soft has nose wire roomy where it needs to be goes under chin easy to wash good buyworth it,2
made very well no complaints,2
fit fabric and cushioning not as expected great quality from asics as expected however the toe box does not allow for much toe wiggle so i know that my forefoot will go numb on a long run too much overall cushioning makes the shoe feel hot and clumsy i had been a long time fan of the asics womens gelnimbus for pavement running in past years buying multiple models up to the gelnimbus 16 the 12 and 15 were my favorites asics changed the footbed and toebox around 17 18 and they lost me as a fan i keep hoping for a new issue that will be great but this is not it,1
these are nothing like the old style versions rubber is very thin and not comfortable will be returning them,0
these are ridiculously big i like loose sweats im pretty small at 57 and 115 i bought a medium and my stepsons who weigh 180 can wear these with room even if id ordered a small theyd still been way to big,0
these fit well but are stiffer than my other bobs super cute,2
the fabric was not what i expected and a little larger than i expected i purchased item for cruise,1
the bracelet is decent in finish and feels great on the wrist but the clasp has very sharp edges and is cheap feeling,1
the masks are junk theres a constant buzzing noise comes from the battery pack and one stopped working after testing it they get a 3 star review as they quickly sent out a new replacement mask but honestly pay a little more and get something better im returning it,1
pros cheap light weight thin very basic watchbr br con background light is useless even in pitch black conditions,2
these shorts are a well made well designed comfortable product that protect womens sensitive areas very well they make riding comfortable,2
these came in much larger than i thought they would be they take up my entire lobe i thought they would me smaller more dainty but they are clunky great idea for kids the backs are just clear plastic very cheap probably easy to fall out thats a huge negative to somebr br i would recommend these for a young girl under twelve dont expect quality but for the price if you really like them it can still be a good deal i will never wear mine,1
i ordered a 2x was way to small fit like a medium wouldnt buy from the seller again,2
its sad because i am soooo in love with this ring but it broke after a week,0
the face makes it a little hard to tell the time however i do like the design and the look of the watch over,1
liked at first the heel is to slippery i fell down stairs,1
loosen up as day went on want to hold tight all day,0
videoidf7089452983f93b1ec8061857e753242 this material is nothing like the first one i purchased not happy with material or fit,0
the stones are pretty but rather tiny these would be good for a child or someone who wants tiny earrings i would have like to know the size of the stone but i didnt ask prior to ordering,1
it fit almost perfect but after a wash in low heat the hoodie shrankbr br i would go a size up if youre looking to get one,1
these are terrible legs too short fit is badbr br yes as others have said your balls will fall out and you cant discreetly correct the issue,0
very cheaply made very good design one set of them was broken no returns dont recommend at all,0
like the item very much no problems,2
i loved this band and bumper screen protector but the band broke on me within a week im still using the screen bumper but had to use a old band,0
slim wrist have challenge to tighten pattern cool,1
delivered on time problem is every now and again it stops working for at least a half hour when reset it works until the next stoppage,0
i ordered a large and it did not fit the description sounded like a large wound fit an adult i dont have a particularly large head it was way too small it might fit a child thoughbr also the bonnet that i received was a bright pink color bright pink is not historically accurate at allbr if your looking for a cute baby bonnet this might work if you are looking for a costume piece than dont waste your money i really wish i could return it,0
i love the look of these shoes but the height makes them extremely difficult to walk in,2
very elegant,2
only one shoe was sent,0
this shawl was exactly what i thought it would be my only caution to buyers would be to make sure you check the box for send in amazon packaging as it came in a see through plastic bag,2
very good,2
i dont know how i feel when i opened the package they smells disgusting then when i tried to put one on they were see through,1
fit isnt very flattering returned it,0
i was disappointed with these sandals and sent them back ive bought many clark products and they usually fit well and provide good support these were poor fitting with wide heel ends although not marked or boxed as large,0
this sneaker runs small in length and width size up at least one complete size if your foot is very wide this would not be a good choicebr br there is not much support to this shoe there are innovative lacing options that should please a variety of fits,1
love this found it at an awesome post season price i wouldnt pay 50 for it much less retail but for 28 its great it is fluffy warm inside with slight neoprene feel to the outer patterned fabric the dark color places are a thinner material overall id have to say that its not the best quality product but is a price performer in this instance it matches what i have and will be a great addition to next years deer seasonbr br editbr wind attacks you at the seams of this jacket they made a panel of the arm where it rests naturally against your body thinner than the rest of the sleeve as a result the seams of the panel are an entry point for wind and make it chilly i wish i could find a solid one of these with the furryfluff lining all over and in a noncamo pattern for more regular wear,1
cardigan is very pretty however since it was intended as a gift and the wrong size was sent i had to take stars away i will need to either wait for return turn around or order another and hope correct size ships it does have pretty flow but size matters and the small will just not look the same,1
it us a wonderful hand bag my wife uses it everyday its also a very good priced article i recommend it greatly,2
very cute should fit anyone 10 up,2
i thought this would be a good idea i have melasma and needed something with a wide brim im not a hat or visor type person i should have just stuck with a hat seemed more inconvenient and harder to keep on than a hat would be the quality seemed okay if you like visors and need a wide brim it should be fine though,1
i put the brown belt next to black shoes and brown shoes and it matches the black ones way too dark the picture does not represent what they actually send,0
this is the first time i have tried this particular mitten the leather does seem abit thin but time and use will tell how they hold up they are warmer than i thought when i first tried them on i really like the fact that they are mittens and do not have fingers inside there is enough room to put a hand warmer in each mitten but i have not had the need to yet i was outside for a hour long snowshoe walk at 7 above my finers were warm,2
great product,2
i can not tell what the material is but it is very thin otherwise it fits okay,1
got green color wanted pink,1
love them fit perfectly,2
nice size and weight however they fall out easily and can easily get warped if not stored seperate from other jewelry i lost one after wearing the earrings only twice,0
the fabric isnt what i expected but it is a comfortable dress,1
this was way too sheer and flimsy the lining was mad out of the same sheer material as the dress so you would be exposing yourself if you didnt wear anything underneath i do not suggest purchasing unless you are using something else as a liner,0
these look great and the packaging was fancy but they are cheaply made the lenses keep coming out every time i clean them and it takes a while to stick them back in,1
love them perfect for cosplay,2
im so glad i switched my order to the larger size option after reading some of these reviews i needed a santa suit which is more difficult to find in smaller womens sizes than i expectedbr br i am 55 and typically wear a size 46 the suit top fit perfectly but the zipper is a few inches further on the inside so it does flap open if you dont use the belt it also seemed a bit short on me falling just at the top of my hip the bottoms are actually capris so you have to wear them with tall boots the waistband is just a thin stretchband but i dont see how they would actually fit any size larger than 10 at mostbr br the fabric is thin and shiny which makes it look like velvet also this is not the typical cherrysanta red shown in the picture my suit was more of a deeper more burgundy red and i definitely didnt match my 8 other friends in their red santa suits,0
very flimsy sent it back,0
dress is way to small neck opening is not proportionate hard to wear should have returned wig isnt best quality but 34ok34,1
love the color and it is soft not to heavy or to light just right for working out in the hot sun of west texas,2
super cute and looks just like the picture there are imprints of the straps on the bag from being pressed together in shipping though,2
if you are a small person like myself their sizes will not fit you material is mediocre but decent for the price,1
instead of 50 masks in the package i received 30 masks only,0
very slim fit be careful when ordering,1
id suggest ordering a size or two down its super flowy,1
ordered 1416 but it was more like a 1012,0
love it,2
it doesnt hold up it is very flimsy i think that is my fault but it is like carrying a wet rag,0
way to smallbr fabric ok your average swim wear fabricbr i am a 40 c and could not zip up over my chestbr love the pattern and stylebr just wished it would have fit,1
muy cómodas para hacer ejercicios,2
really nice but runs small,2
this top is very comfortable but adjust a little too big in the waist i decided not to return itbr the print is not as appealing in person as the photos on line the characters look more cartoonish and like they were drawn by inexperienced designers but it is bright and cheerful for gray winter days,1
not like the old ones these newer flava watches suck you cant even tell what time it is when you look at the watch from a slight twist of the wrist this newer flava watch sucks compared to the older version,0
i was skeptical about buying sunglasses online without being able to try them on first but im glad i gave it a shot really impressed with the overall quality of the lenses frames comfort etc even came with a sunglass screwdriver keychain and a really nice protective case would totally recommend this brand and buy from them in the future,2
the wallet itself seemed to be built pretty well at first aside from not being able to hold money on the inside and me wanting a different color then what i recieved it held about barely 8 cards within 3 days the plastic clip to keep it closed broke if they would make the clip out of metal and maybe charge a few more dollars i think the product would be much better i loved it while it worked though,0
i bought these harem pants since theyre made of a material that is great for cooler weather and i like the color that is actually blue and not black they do not fit as regular harem pants do the crotch is too far down making leg movement limited i will only wear them with the leg cuffs just below my knees since that helps no i wont be returning them i will not buy harem pants like these again since they arent as comfortable as the ones ive worn before i learned from this purchase and now have a better idea of what i prefer in harem pants,1
i bought this for a 1920s garden party and it was perfect the fit was perfect the dress is very light weight so perfect for a hot day i feel its made well and will hold up over time,2
awfully large for an xl and very long also i love the tiger design but the black part of the shirt has a funny mottled look to it that seems dirty or splotchy instead of something planned or complimentary to the design unfortunately i think the black detracts from an otherwise great design,1
stash your treasures in this tiny zipper bag adorable bombshell print tyvek sturdy bag stays 3 dimensional when zipped,2
decent everyday slipper,2
took this out of the box and immediately fell in love with the lookbeautiful chain link with dainty crystal rhinestones wore it 34 times and it began to tarnish and change colors was very disappointed other necklaces that werent real gold that ive purchased on amazon have not turned colors,1
compartment for change a little awkward would have been better with zipper on opposite side,1
can i give these 6 stars i got these to protect and cool my arms for sunrunning in texas sunrunning is a silly game where i pick the hottest and most humid day to go for a long run and hopefully have a great run without having a heat stroke note i have been doing this for awhile and do not recommend you try this at home in any event i normally pay 23 times more for sleeves thus i was startled when i received 2 pairs so wow pretty good value they do look fantastic i will upload pics soon as the colors really pop my favorite thing about these besides cooling and protecting my arms from sun damage is the band strung around the inside of the arm that holds the sleeve up on my upper arms this really matters to me because i have 17 inch biceps bought the xl size and they fit perfectly while other arm bands have slid down while running you will love these,2
very wellmade i love it,2
grandson likes,2
its decent feels like a mixture of tarp and cloth not my personal favorite but for the price its ok,0
looks great one wear and the gold shoe lace circle came off and the toe leather material scuffed right off way too easily after one wear,1
a little flimsy,1
no me gusta que la parte delantera de la zuela resbala un poco,0
this bag is not 34genuine34 leather it is beautifully made solid construction but it is a heavyduty fabric of some sort covered with polyurethane or vinyl or some kind of plastic not leather maybe some parts are leather maybe its thin cheap leather with a fabric backing and a plastic coating and that is not 34genuine34 leatherbr giveaways includebr 1 the obvious plastic coating on the edges of cut pieces handles and buckle flaps etcbr 2 when even gently twisting parts of the handle for example the skin reveal fine wrinkles in the plastic coating this bag would no way stand up to months of daily usebr 3 the smell the description on includes that there is a 34genuine leather smell34 but that is not what the powerful odor is its offgassing volotile syntheticchemical compounds from the manufacturing process 3 days outside on my balcony and it still reeksbr 4 the biggest giveaway is the scrape on the bottom of the bag where the thin pink plastic coating is flaking offbr br im super disappointed i love the look and size of this bag it would have been the perfect work pursetote it fit my laptop snacks and water bottle plus all my purse items would have eliminated the need for a second work bag back to shoppingand now even more wary of all the great reviews on amazon or could so many people really not be able to discern that this bag is not leather,0
allinall im very pleased with this item its soft exactly as pictured and has nice stretch the only thing that stands out is that the arm holes feel like theyre either just slightly too high up ir the stitching restricts the stretch a bit too much otherwise it fits perfectly it just has that one awkward spot the sleeves are super cute and definitely my favorite detail of the sweater definitely a nice option for the pricebr br for reference i am a plus size gal with 484050 measurements and i had been able to order an xxl,2
nice fit great color lovely product,1
pros a decent price for the product the material doesnt feel cheap its not seethrough its softbr cons the strap ripped off literally the first time i wore one im not very upset its an easy fix but just a little inconvenient,1
and the best part its not nike the company that uses chinese slave labor,2
very cheaply made see through returned it,0
seam and lining damaged dark spots on brim fits very well,1
bought the pink ones after losing similar pink ones years back was very excited to finally replace them and then arrives white barely had any color on them at all i already have white ones so this was not helpful nor was it worth returning,0
tight listen to the other reviewers and order a size up,1
the zipper on the jacket broke after the fourth or fifth wear it had a cheap plastic zipper slider,0
seemed nice at first but broke within the first month,0
these are cheaply made you pay for what you get in person they dont even really look like totoro the pair that i got the pattern stitched on the white stomach are not angled correctly like the picture so it looks weird the sizing fits my feet usa womens 85 near perfectly however i bought these with the intention of giving them to my son who wears a boys size 25 shoe i would not recommend these,0
not quality,1
nice,2
i love them very good quality for the price i wear them over leggings with boots or even slides like in the pic or just to lounge around the house in i highly recommend i want to buy them in all the different colors,2
i love the color and style but they run big i am a 99 12 i bought a size 9 and they are too big,1
lovely soft fabric way to small for me xl fit my very slim 12 year old nieces,0
great product shipped in a timely manner unfortunately amazon did their usual substandard sealing job on the box and usps had to retape it,2
i like that you can take everything you need i would suggest a wrist strap i use one from another product,2
this shirt looks cheap up close,0
too short,1
yo me confundi pense que me llegarian de diferentes colores pero me gusto que se adapta a cualquier talla,1
very nice wallet absolutely perfect in all aspects with the minor exception i would have given it 5 stars but the swiss metal button attached to the wall it actually hurts your back side while sitting,1
open the bag the swimwear are dirty dirty is ok the worst thing is missing one chest cup very disappointed,0
order a size up bought for my son they fit me made decently however,1
this can really dress up an outfit,1
a bit smaller than i had expected i even got out a ruler i was hoping it would be large enough to hold my planner but no luck things topple out of the front pocket quite easily and the magnetic clasps arent easy to secure they dont just 34grab34 you have to work at them to get them to grab i like that its handy and holds my things but definitely want to be careful of what you place in the side pouch its well made and is of good quality it just doesnt work for what i had intended i get a ton of compliments on it though,1
no me gustaron,1
i like the feel of these they are a little long but i am on the short side so it is expected,2
very good quality,2
these are very cute i love them,2
i ordered two of these vests i ordered two sizes bigger as per other reviewers one of them fits well and one of them is too large if they both fit the same i would give 5 stars the quality seems okay,1
was looking for a cheap ring bc i always loose mine looks real i get a lot of compliments and love it,2
runs way too small than advertised,0
i bought these sunglasses as a gift for my father since he wore out his previous pair and i have to say im simply admired by the quality of this product they fit perfectly for his abnormal wide head lol recommended for everyone having trouble finding a good economic pair of functional sunglasses,2
length is too short for an adult i took it in so my 7 year old could wear it we had to hot glue a feather back on after one wear but it was inexpensive and she loves it super cute for a little kid if you know how to sew,2
good buy,1
not packaged like if you buy it from the store sadly disappointed with that as its part of presentation when i give these to my wife i will buy directly from pandora for now on,0
i dislike the fact that these were made so cheaply aside from the poor quality i received one keychain without the key holder attached and a keychain with blue dye or ink on the white of the sole i purchased the smaller pack to check them out to give as favors for a girls preteen birthday they are a joke and now i have to return them to a whole foods which is out of my way search elsewhere,0
too small i ordered the 3x not american sizes gave to a friend who loved it she is going to wear it as a coverup on the beach very thin see thru surprised me i was going to wear it to a dressy banquet glad i had a backup,1
see my review of the green tiered skirt the customer service of this company is appalling ordered on 310 and finally arrived 46 after several contacts with the company this top was on sale and it is worth the price it can be worn a couple of ways it is fairly sheer but it has washed up nicely the color was true to the webpage,1
these look nice in and i think theyre made out of a good quality metal as i have sensitive ears and have been wearing them for about a week now with no issues my only complain is that one pair in particular was extremely hard to open and close but i fixed it with a pair of wire cutters,2
personal use,1
such a cute gift for a nonwalking baby boy pleased with the quality for the price,2
looks good but not polarized,1
honestly disappointed mine look nothing like the picture even if the color wasnt exactly the same i expected at least a little of the fire that every other moissanite i own has had including the others from gemstone king these look like synthetic sapphires like decent quality lab created sapphires but not what i was looking for i almost wonder if i was sent the right pair,1
sits crooked cannot straightened,1
i only wish they were non slip if you have all carpet product will be perfect,1
update after having worn these a few weeks i can tell you the boot is causing tendinitis on my right ankle from where the leather meets the front ankle ive stretched them out but the leather on the front top is very stiff and thats the issue avoid these like the plaque seller took around 3 weeks to ship out tracking info was useless was very disappointed with the seller boots are ok amazon disappointed me by not allowing cancellation of the order when it was even shipped yet why pay for prime,0
decent size pretty color but the bag handle 34leather34 looks a little cheap,1
order a size down material is full of stretch,1
very lowquality product,0
so happy with my purchase quick delivery the medallions are as pretty as the picture,2
the overall quality of this bag was not worth the price charged while i am certain that the proper bag was sent it did not look quite like the one pictured even empty the bag was kind of puffy rather than smooth and sleek as pictured the straps were long enough for me to wear it over my shoulders when just wearing indoor clothing however it would not have been comfortable to wear over the shoulders when wearing a coat overall the bag just seemed cheaply made,0
the fabric was not fleece and the rainbow effect was poor,0
pretty color very thin it has a belt but no belt loops it took a month to get it so think twice if its a gift i tried to cancel i think the next day but they claim it had shipped i would not purchase again i cant believe they call it a winter robe as thin as it is smh,0
these shoes were presented as wide width and many of the reviews said they were actually too wide and had to go down a size that was sadly not my experience the shoes did not fit especially through the toe box and were very uncomfortable sorry i couldnt recommend they were cute,0
i loved these when i got them perfect fit but after washing them a couple times they are slidong down dont hold at all youll have to change them every or every other months,1
awesome bag great color lots of pockets perfect size well made,2
ive never wrote a review before so the first you review you see from me on this product was a typo the swimsuit is a great material but im 50 and about 132 lbs i ordered a large everything fits nice but it feels a little short on me like i cant stand up straight when i have it on when i tug the swimsuit down it moves the breast pads i dont think its really proportioned right or maybe i just a defected one,1
i have problems with my feet thats why i returned them,2
the dress looked like the picture but the material was so thin you could see through it,1
these are very blingy they do seem to retaintheir shine it is too much carat weight to look remotely real but its pretty,2
i cant complain for the price i paid i did go up two sizes as suggested by others and the fit is not too bad just the arms are a bit snug and i dont think i could wear it if im wearing anything with thick sleeves it looks nice though it sounds like it is lines with paperbr it would make a pretty good base for a costume which is probably what ill end up using it for,1
after two weeks of use the inside material had ripped,0
did not work,0
easy street womens fabulous pump footwear fit great and true to it size,2
pretty shiney and dainty,2
id call the boot socks the are supposed to be cushioned and they are very padded the navy color socks are navy only on the bottom of the foot and greyblack mix where they showcolor these are fine for boots but i dont wear boots much they are a bit too heavy for everyday shoes,1
material is stiff and not soft gave as a gift but did not like it,1
i normally wear a size 6 but i decided to get a large because i didnt want them to be too tight around my calves they fit well in the legs but theyre too big around the waist as i expected the material is nice and light weight but not see through as far as i can tell my biggest critique is that the back pockets are small and strangely far apart not exactly flattering but i figure ill usually be wearing a long shirt with these so i wont lose sleep over it overall a good buy for the price and i love the color i bought green,1
extremely small children size,0
wearing as maternity dress,2
overall okay quality maybe a step below f21 quality i am 56 130pounds 32ddd i ordered the us small taiwan medium and the arms and body were too big but i am busty so the chest was too small i would order a us xs but then the chest would be worse i was looking for a more modest bathing suit oh well still cute if the shoe fits i suppose also comes with weird cups but you can remove those so dont wig when you see em,1
did not fit like i wanted,1
ive been wearing and ordering tevas for yearsand i literally thought these were china knockoffs or something as soon as i put them on i just came to look at the seller here on amazon and its tevas totally shocked not only are they more narrow which is ok for my narrow feet but they had no support and are flimsy the sole material feels like theyve already been worn for a yearlike already worn down im extremely disappointed because every other year prior i always know what im going to getand they have a firm supportive foot bed they have cheaped out so much nowim going to have to find another goto flipflop because this isnt it will be returning quality is completely gone,0
i couldnt get this to work it did properly pair with my environment and i was able to successfully create a trigger event with indigo but getting the buttons to actually work was futile the remote is too small too you really need two hands to operate it bought two and sent them both back,0
i love this outfit although the colors and designs arent exactly like the photo shown,0
paper thin i had to put black tights under it still didnt look good,0
returned it,1
jeans were too small this may have been due to me not noticing that these were juniors sizing also the jeans did look the same as the ones pictured in my opinion,0
the elastic band is weird it rolls upwards and it makes the skirt higher the fabric is really thick which is nice because it wont be see through it is a little on the short side,0
what a shame the pattern i bought is awesome but theyre tiny im only 129 lbs and they arent lose fitting at all and shows every belly budge ive bought many of the same style pants throughout amazon and never had this issue before if not for how cute the design is i would have given it only 1 star beware one size will not at all fit all itll fit the way harem pants should fit if youre a size 4 possibly a 6 nothing more,0
these pants give you marshmallow legs way too long and large for me going back not really petite ran too long on me,0
great price for 3 pairs of shoes i love them and they seem to be comfortable on my baby she doesnt complain and shell keep them on all day,2
just purchased this item and the glue that holds the sole on is trying to fall off havent even worn them yet very disappointing id like a address to return this item and get a refund or replacement please,0
the bifocals part was too low returned,0
nice material but too small for the size it is supposed to fit to,0
im giving these 5 stars for the fit and pockets material is great and they are very comfortablebr the only downside is my wife wont actually let me wear them to the gym inappropriate was the term she used so they are great lounging around shorts,2
perfect size and just as pictured also arrived well ahead of scheduled datehowever earring backs do not fit onto posts of the earrings you must use generic plastic ones in order to wear the earrings,1
hand washed and red bled expensive lossbr loved alfred dunner til this happenedwill not purchase again,0
these earrings were very nice for the price,2
nice,2
this dress is amazing i now want it in every color the lines sticking are very high quality the sleeves are adorable not to mention how slimming overall flattering this style is i absolutely adore this dress am so happy with my purchase i will be buying another one very soon,2
fits well very comfortable,2
way way way too small bigger girls actual plus size girls do not let the fact that this says plus size lead you to believe that it is they are no more than say a size 14br the colors are very vivid they are beautiful and soft i wish they fit because theyd be my leggings for tomorrow i am very sad to return them very sadbr im normally a 4x and theres no way,1
i usually wear large but didnt want the skin tight feeling and pinching i usually experience from swimsuits so i sized up to xl and it fits perfectly without any awkward sagging color and fit is exactly as pictured id describe the bottoms as a midrise moderate coverage my only complaint is that i couldnt convert the v neck into a halter top because the inward seam would gap too much i think it would work if youre well endowed,2
this is made of a very thin low quality t shirt fabric it is not a real sweatshirt its also too short and very boxyunflattering not really worth it especially when you have to pay to return ship,0
love it i love the color quality and case my favorite color will buy from this seller again,2
i have been looking for a leotard like this,2
he said they are fing awesome and super comfy,2
they didnt fit my boots or my husbands they were very small i sent them back,0
im 56 155 lbs and a dd cupbr br the dress i ordered was a size large but it fit very snuggly around my waist back and bust i am going to return it nice quality material overall a really cute highquality dress im bummed,2
i have a hard time with compression shorts riding up when i run these really do stay in place yes im 510 and weigh 170 i have a 305 waist and the medium fit perfect these are my go to running shorts i run 4 times a week more than 5 miles each run,2
way to big bulky and heavy such a nice design but the picture is deceiving,1
good pants all zippers broke,1
really pretty items but a few of them have pointy edges that dig into the sides of my navel also the largest one is quite heavy,0
after locking it and setting a combination it would no longer open i sat there and went through all 1000 combinations and none of them opened it,0
i returned due to the fact that the strap in the back wasnt even large enough to get my pinky in i wasnt able to pull the heel on i guess if you can get them on they would be casual but didnt work for me,1
this is too short for a tall girl this might fit your average size well but definitely not meant for someone tall i am 510 and this had me far too worried to wear returning but sad about it dress fit true to size and was good quality overall,2
im 59 and this was so short didnt even fit me as long as some tshirts hahabr br so if youre a shorty its very cute and a good shape,1
family pictures,1
love these shoes just minutes after walking a few feet i found myself walking ½ mile and on some gravel these support my feet ankles and arches feel so good and will be great on a boat at the lake no slip soles,2
i wanted to love this dress so much but i just cant get over the ruffles on the sleeve they sit straight up i dont even believe ironing them will keep them down the material is great not sheer or see through at all and is good quality if you love ruffles at the sleeve this dress is perfect for you i have very narrow shoulders and this one just looked funny on me,1
this dress fits well but it flares out at the bottom like a mermaid i personally hate it but if youre into that look than this is perfect for youbr i got it to wear in miami for a bachelorette party but ended up putting it right back in the bag after purchasing it br im 56145lbs i purchased a medium,1
purse started to come apart around the edges which look like wax,0
not cotton a spandex material,0
love this top definitely shows off the girls but in a good way,2
had to return it its not windproof not for cold weather just a thin tight fabric to put over your head,0
they rings broke when i put them on i was trying to tight them a little bit the peace of it broke off,0
this dress was very see through and thin,0
too big for my wristugh,1
i love the mesh idea however they run large they dont stay up where they should be they are very attractive just too big,1
i got size 9 it was a little bit small,1
i ordered these slippers for my dad they are of good quality and are very warm which he wanted as well as nice looking,2
did not look right in the chest area skirt was darling,0
bought for a woodstock party this weekend the shirt looks great and it was delivered in one day which was also great i purchased 2x xl i should have bought 34 xl times the shirt fits small my normal size is xl i wont wash it for the party i then have a dilemma if i should return it or not i would still like the shirt even after the party but am a bit uncomfortable using an item and then returning it thats not my style,2
the cloth was easy to use and really brought the sparkle back to my gold chain watch and be surprised as you clean your jewelry i was so surprised to see how much oil had accumulated from my thin gold chain it comes with two layers of the blue cloth and two layers of the white cloth so it can clean plenty of jewelry the price is fair and i would recommend it to a friend,2
this did not seem to do much on my suede boots but i used it on my workboots and when i spill water or get rained on i can see the water bead up and slide off disappointed about it on my winter boots but glad its working on my other boots,1
this watch was very attractive it had a very smooth and sleek look it looks very nice on the wristbr br it is very flattering it fits well on it is very comfortable to wear it goes on and off easilybr br it worked without a problem it kept good timebr br the quality is very good this would make a very good gift for someonebr br the price is reasonable i would recommend it,2
too tight cut off my circulation painful,0
its a beautiful shade of violet super stretchy i am 52 180 lbs 36dd and ordered an xl because i carry my weight in my belly the size chart listed a max waist measurement of 33ish and im a 39 i think i could have gotten away with a l it does bunch in the back since its not designed for a petite person i still loved it got complements every where we went,2
really love these great quality,2
ruined after 1st wash,1
i really like this jackethad to take a star away for the collar not being detachable as is stated in the washing instructions i am not a fan of the hot itchy faux squirrel tail trim layered on my neck the green is darker and more understated in color than i washing for like in the photo but its very pretty nonetheless the gold zippers good looking and yet are not super smooth but look nice and the bit of extra finishing pinstripe trim in dark brown looks nice too fit is true to measurements and even though it is not heavy in weight its warm,2
the size is way too big i love the shoes tho i will keep it until my son grows into it,1
the print is adorable but they have less support than regular ol 2 dollar knee highs,0
is was good for a night but since it was made out of felt the shoes covers came apart but it did get us through the school performance,1
awesome,2
baby loved it and he is happy wearing it so i am happy the saying on it is cool company provides a nice note with the shipment go army beat navy baby agrees,2
i bought these a few years ago for work on the ambulance in the hotter months and loved loved loved them great support very cushy nice no slip sole after two years they needed to be replaced since the sole was pretty work seriously i buy new shoes for the truck every 6 mths to a year so the fact these lasted two years is pretty good no one even knew they were crocs and were amazed to find that out bought a new pair in hopes they would be good for the hospitalbr br happy to get the new pair only to find something has changed horribly they look the same but they dont feel the same the foot bed is now very hard with no squish or support i cant imagine wearing these for a few hours now let alone all shift which is too bad because i had really loved my first pair,0
maybe i bought this from the wrong seller i dont knowbr br i took all my measurements twice and followed the sellers size chart and ordered accordingly where they fail is that more important than your waist measurement is your underbustbr br dress fit fine at my waist and at the bust zipper wouldnt close the last 15 br br second problem is the top is completely transparent there are two little pink pads to cover your nipples but the pads are completely visible through the gauzy material of the dress so it looks really cheap and cheesybr br like i said maybe i got the short stick and bought it from a knock off seller but theres no way of knowingbr br sent it back,1
i like that these shirts are super soft but i find them a bit too baggy and loose so the front part is always wide open would be nice if there was a button to keep the front closed when not nursing i would not buy again,1
not as described supposed to be a 3 pack and only 1 arrived,0
looks good but small,1
really cute length it goes just a little below the bottom of my breasts the linked pinkies are clear and cute on my left shoulder the sleeves are not fitted which i love the fabric is a thick t shirt knit material great fit,2
got a size medium and it was an extra small fit at best,0
perfect,2
perfect,2
in addition to the items turning dark the clasps on two of the necklaces have already broken,0
terrible the sticky backing left sticky residue on my swim suit and it was only on them for less than 24 hrs i also never got to wear the white swim suit because when i put the insert in you can see the 34invisible underwear34 outline it looked like i was wearing a pad,0
love these little necklaces they are for my granddaughter to go with a christmas dress im making for them,2
surprisingly sheer but in fairness its too tight in the chest area im a 4042d and quite unflattering primarily due to the placement of the pockets theyre right on the sides of the dress and hit at the hips making me look even more lumpy and bumpy in that area than i am id order an xl but the pocket situation would undoubtedly still be an issue and it would likely be too long as well the large just hits the floor while im barefoot disappointing because i loved the pattern but its going back,0
love the color and style but the bust runs much larger than the bottom,1
really gorgeous bag but the world needs to figure out that there are actually people out here who own smart phones that are not i the pocket tooooo small for any other,1
very comfortable and cute also thin enough for year round wear my daughter loves it,2
esta muy bonita pero el short a la primera lavada se decoloró,1
horrible sewing and terrible fabric stay clear away,0
perfect thicker than normal cotton socks so may be just a winter time sock very warm and wont keep your feet wet if they sweat a lot like mine i wear these to work in heavy steel toe boots for 12 hour shifts and they still seem like new after a year of winter wearing they fit great and dont stretch out they actually shrink a tiny bit after the wash so they are nice and tight fitting every time you put them on i am buying more,2
i like the material it was made of,1
very cute,2
this dress is a steal i would suggest order and size up just because it really hugs curves unless youre into that i revived sooo many compliments and people were amazed that i got it from amazon i are it to a fire ice themed event and it was perfect very comfortable quality fabric and the shimmer really shines through if you got more junk in the trunk dont worry about the slit you can twerk all night long with no coochie slip but this dress,2
real junk im sending back 2 pairs,0
fabulous boots super cute and will keep my kiddos feet dry in the rain the fit is good and the color and design are perfect for a boy in the lower elementary grades,2
not good bad quality due to inferior metal quality and paint ended up returning it,0
the primary goal of slippers imo is to feel softer than the surface youre walking on shoes fit well but it feel like your walking on concrete not memory foam so if youre just looking for a durable slip on theyre good but if youre looking to walk in comfort i recommend looking elsewhere,0
they are paper thin ripped vertically on right leg as i put them on i have skinny legs and couldnt rip across if it wasnt defective crap the only reason i didnt return was they were cheap and i got what i paid for threw away immediately never buy,0
runs small i ordered an xl and it fits more like a l or even medium arms are tight overall style and quality are as expected otherwise,1
really dark look great love the extra case and screwdriver included very impressed although i feel the sunglasses are not very durable i wouldnt hesitate to repurchase should i break them 603,2
cheaply made i should have known better,0
the fit was perfect on the xxl for a 55 person195lbs the material looks good is stretch comfy but breaks down within two to three washings they started to pillget the little fuzzy balls up after the first wash if i had know these things i wouldnt have purchased them,1
way too small,0
the sweater is very soft but feels very synthetic ill wear it around the house but its not something id wear professionally or even causal friday jeans friday night sort of top,0
love it,2
i needed a new set of zills these were perfect great sound and price excellent vendor service very happy,2
i ordered a large and i swam in it so i ordered a medium and it was very tight the difference between them was huge so i think the sizing is way off too bad because it is very cute and i really wanted it to work,1
this is my first pair of jim green boots but it wont be the last fit is true size quality leather and construction took them out of the box immediately upon receipt put them on cant wait to get them broken in,2
the purple lenses are so light theres almost no tint cheap plastic that fits horribly theres no adjustment in the face area at all and no padding around the back to uncomfortable to use for just a halloween costume huge disappointment,0
didnt care for the fit returned,1
i was surprised with the quality of the fitbit metal band it adds an increased quality appearance to my fitbit blaze than the original plasticsilicon band i was even more surprised that the cost of this band included the tools to adjust it to my wrist the adjustment process is a bit tricky having not done this before but i am please with the results on a onetofive star rating i give this six stars,2
surprisingly thin it picks up the light and presents a gleaming spiral effect to show off the jewelry it proclaims the length is what we preferred and was more comfortable than the 1834 we first purchased from another supplier highly recommend,2
great jacket definitely as warm as down yet very light theres a few downsides to the design pockets are located too low and allow wind to sneak in while in use because they affect the waistline the zipper is actually located on the left hand side so not american fashion friendly lastly they sell giga7 models which are last years model for the full price of the newest model giga8 i know this because i have also purchased a new jacket from the manufacturer which is a giga8 at the same exact price,1
i have worn them a handful of times already they are super soft super comfy very flattering and hold up well in the wash they look the same on the fifth wear as they did on the first its all the comfort of wearing leggings without looking like you just left yoga i would buy them again and again,2
nice flair,2
i too never thought id be 34that parent34 the parent with his kid on a leash while raising my three older children id scoff at the foolish dad publicly dragging his child around by the childs teddy bear backpack lashed to his fathers wrist 34their kid simply needs more discipline34 i thoughtbr br then my fourth child reached walking age daringly bolting into traffic at every turn with the speed of an olympic sprinter slipping out of my grip like some stealthy fish and climbing anything he comes across hes a veritable spiderman great for peter parker notsogreat for my two year oldbr br after one too many close calls we broke down and joined the ranks of other embarrassed parents across the world by buying the brica by my side safety harness backpack the backpack is more than amazing its literally a life saver my son now stays within 3634 of us when were in busy or dangerous areas as a bonus my son also loves to wear his backpack excitedly putting it on himself before we go outsidebr br this is a great product for parents with adventurous and independent little guys and gals id recommend it to anyone whose child is not so carproof or otherwise unafraid unaware of danger,2
love the size and the faux fur but the handle is too cheap and will break,0
it was gr8 until i bought a case it would not work with,2
update stars are removed for quality so i paid 120 for four months of using these shoes now they have hole in the front mesh and in material inside of the shoe after four months they going to trash i sent email to asics they did not bother even to respondi liked them i even bought the same pair for my son and now we both have holes in this asics mens gel kayano 22 running shoebr br the reason i bought this pair was an upgrade from my old asics 21 that had the same problem holes in the meshbr br i am done with asicsbr __________________________________________________________________________________________________br br original reviewbr br this review is for pair of asics shoes they are listed here as 34asics mens gelkayano 22 running shoe34br br first i was stupid enough to follow amazon size suggestion i always wear size 13 d regular so amazon 34fit find the right size34 drop down offered me correct size what a joke i got as advised size 125 d regular the shoe was too short and not wide enough my foot hurts all over even removing asics sole and replacing it with thin one did not help much i was able to put them on but not able to wear them all daybr br on my second try i got my size size 13 and i got widest 4e now it works i would probably would be fine with 2e but i didnt want to risk it againbr br so shoe gets five star but amazon advise get zero stars,0
these are the size of childrens glasses,0
im overweight size 8 or 10 and these give me the thigh version of muffin top its like the manufacturers think your thighs and calves are the same size quality is fine just not happy with the sizestructure opening should be wider than the foot because even at a healthy weight my thighs are still bigger than my ankles,0
these sandals look and feel cheap in person they fit fine but not as comfortable for long walk i wear them when work on my backyard as the color is too tacky to be seen at a social function,0
the earrings are beautiful and i really like them the packaging was horrible the jewerly box was mashed and torn i almost returned them but the actual earrings seem to be okay,2
the color isnt as nice in person as it is online it looks more like the john deere green in real life decent quality sweatshirt would probably recommend getting another color,2
this robe is absolutely deliciousbr its not heavy but it is surprisingly warm and cozy i love putting it on and i hate taking it offbr this has to be one of the most fun articles of clothing ive ever owned it feels incredible against my skin its so sensuous and comfortingbr one of the most wonderful little attributes is the narrow sleeves super easy to just push up when im cooking or doing other things where i need my sleeves out of the way i dont knock things over and they get in the way and drag into things everything about this robe is simply perfectbr the only thing i would add or change would be a few more inches to the length so it almost touched the groundim 55 and have a medium and it hits just above my ankles,2
i liked it at first but i didnt even get to wear it before it started to fall apartbr first the chain broke then it wasnt even red like it supposed to be and thebr top part of it that goes around crystal started to come loose,0
lace is pretty but too delicate to use for footliners didnt last 20 minutes needs solid sole and reinforcement in toes,0
i needed a lightweight hoodie and this works however the picture shows a dark gray color which is what i wanted what i received is a light gray heather im wearing it because i needed it but im not thrilled that i didnt get the color i ordered,1
its soft and comfortable but thats about it if you need something super lightweight then its good but definitely not a winter jacket i wash everything before i wear it everything there are no wash instructions on it this was washed on a light cleaning cycle basically general cycle and its already falling apart and the fuzzy stuff keeps getting stuck in the zipper i wouldnt recommend buying this at all,1
i love these sandals i always get the best complements too whenever i got out just dont leave em everywhere around the house someone might step on them,2
i have worn birkenstock sandals for over 40 years and i finally talked my wife into wearing them now she hardly takes them off,2
too tight,1
i returned my order as they shrunk until they became too short to wear also the button hole was too large and the pants would come undone every time the zipper was lowered,0
i am 56 125 lbs and i ordered a small in this dress and it fit like a tent the arms were the only fitted part of the whole dress it was also way too long it looked ridiculous so i sent it back,0
runs super small,0
this wallet has been designed for a compact form factor however it is not a practical wallet since there are too few slots provided to accommodate all the items typically present in a wallet these include debit card s credit card s medical insurance id costcosams membership cash auto insurance card as a professional i would like to carry few business cards with me which is not possible with this wallet these are very basic requirements and there are people who carry way more items overall i am very disappointed with this product i bought this wallet due to the positive reviews but i am surprised nobody has mentioned these issues,0
its ok kinda flimsy and took quite a while to bend it into a decent shape im not sure i would recommend this one unless youre very concerned about matching hat color with coat costume color,0
does not state in the product detail that the accents are gold not silver it also looks pretty cheap,0
great looking watch however ive started to have a problem after a short period of time with the date staying correct it seem to want to always advance every 12 hours,0
overall very nice but be aware the lenses are greenbrown not neutral brown if youre used to amber brown driving glasses you may be dissappointed also for fellow bushy eyebrow people the frame rides right on the eyebrows drove me crazy too bad nice pair but the lens color and fit didnt work out for me returned,1
beautiful watch my daughter loved the gold tone and the small circle of rhinestones on the face,2
not very well made needed better quality for the wallet,0
so far fog spray seems to be working its not 100 perfect at preventing fog not sure there is anything out there that does but this spray does make wearing masks with glasses so much better,2
doesnt fit right wasted my money,1
the color depicted in the photo is not the actual color but the shirt is a nice shirt,1
perhaps my light green bag is too old but did not clean as i needed at all,0
runs small my son is almost 10 years old and very slender this medium sized zip hoodie is quite small compared to under armour nike runs extremely smaller in size we like the jacket but he will only be able to wear it for the next couple of months wish i would have bought a bigger size,1
very pretty looks good on my sweater,2
definitely a casual belt would not recommend it for anything else the finish and appearance definitely lends itself to be something mass produced in an economy of scale if you know what i mean,1
this is an excellent and beautiful watch i recommend it for everyone who likes a watch with excellent presence,2
awful quality did not look like picture at all very cheap material i returned it,0
its a nice shoe but this rigid frame that theyve put inside on the heel side truly hurt my ankle,1
they patterns were cute but too big for my legs i ordered a lxl bc my calves are 16 inches in diameter will reoder in the smaller size in a perfect world they would come in individual sizes,0
not satisfied with item they are too small the rings cant even fit my pinky finger they barely fit my 6yr old goddaughters fingers ring did not meet my expectations,0
these socks provide great support and do not roll down this product is exactly as advertisedi love them,2
have returned it for a smaller size,2
i got these shoes for walking at work i worked in a busy emergency room and after a few hours walking around my feet were killing me i could not wear these at work i do wear these to work out in since they are super lightweight i would not recommend these for walking long distances there is little to no padding in these they are great for just running errands in but not much else i would not recommend these as a walking shoe i should have sent these back but i have made use out of them for my work outs,1
runs really small,0
i was so sad when my upper arms didnt fit i loved the lace and how pretty the profile on it i knew it was a rick to buy something with a 34 sleeve its pretty just not on me,1
wide,1
i freaking love it,2
these fit differently than their 34space dyed34 sock siblings i do not like these nearly as much they are a bit too tight around my ankle,0
cant tell that they arent real diamonds beautiful set of earing and you sure cant beat the price,2
great tank made of thin lightweight material it did fit a little tighter than i was expecting it isnt form fitting but it doesnt hang off of the body like i thought it would based on the picture great for working out doing chores running errands or robot themed birthday parties like i did,2
i purchased this dress as well as the asymmetrical hem of the same design and quite liked both however i found that the symmetrical hem on this one was not as flattering contributed to making me look bulky whereas the asymmetrical hem was very flattering contributed to making me look sleek and stylish i ended up returning this dress and keeping the asymmetrical hem cut but would have kept this one if the asymmetrical hem cut hadnt existed as i liked it well enough but i dont need two almost identical dressesbr br the sizing is indeed somewhat small i ordered larger than normal because i am actually pregnant and want to be able to use these as maternity dresses its very forgiving around the hips but the arms are tight as you can see in the photo please forgive the poor photo quality despite sizing up the arms are much too tight to be pushed up as long as youre okay with wearing them down to your wrists all the time this should not be a problem for youbr br as many have noted the fabric is thin not so much as to be seethrough at least not in the olive color but be sure your bra smooths down well under it seams all seemed to be in good order having kept the other dress in the same fabric i can say that it washes well but that youll want to wash on delicate and be sure to linedry or im sure it will pill up quicklybr br regarding the pockets well i really love a dress with pockets and really wanted them to work out but the truth is the fabric is so thin that putting anything even something relatively light like house keys in the pockets will pull at the fabric so much that it completely distorts the look the dress okay in an emergency but these are not dailyuse pockets alas,1
closure clasp broke on the first day but i like the design,1
pounch too small for medium,1
wearing it the first time i somehow got a pull in it and its ruined it looks like a white line down the front of the black shirt disappointing,0
i got these specifically for walking on my treadmill which can be hard at age 46 after abusing my feet in flip flops all day my feet arent always comfortable by the time i get my 10k steps in but they survive and these look good,2
love the band,2
extremely comfortable so elegant and rich looking despite being super low priced perfect navy color i was looking for couldnt be more happy with them,2
i wish these came in a wide i had to return as they were on the small side and narrow,1
i dont like these they color looks matte and makes them look cheap no the price range isnt top of the line but i still didnt expect them to look so inexpensive i was running late for work one the morning i put them on but should have taken them off and returned them like i wanted to ive ordered similar boots in the same price range from amazon and they looked great just beware,0
unfortunately i wore holes in these within two weeks one just outside the rubber bottom and one in the toe somehow so these just arent very durable had to throw them away today when the hole in the toe went all the way through,0
really impressed by this dress for price the quality is so nice super comfortable kind of stinks that its dry clean only but really my only complaint its very loose fitting so if you want it more formfitting size down,2
not very cute sent back,0
very flattering fits comfortably and easy care,2
its really cute and feels heavy duty,2
these are ok theyre a little snug for me and i ordered a 12 size up from my normal size theyre short in the toe for me,1
you had to be in the brightest and hottest sun to get any movement of the fan not much air movement at all chalk it up to 34novelty34 level gimmick,0
they are a little tight with gym socks and a little loose without though i dont use them often the biggest thing i noticed right away was a lack of foot support maybe it will change with more use but my old ones from another maker had good support,1
good product for the price,2
i purchased this dress for an ultra sexy date it took weeks to come in once i tried it on i realized there was an incredibly large hole in the dress that apparently was never shown when they actually put the dress together it actually looks like the material did not rip but more or less that the seam is not aligned other than that the dress is ok except it is extremely difficult to get into it almost feels like spandex over all i was very disappointed with this purchase i received this product for a discounted for my unbiased opinion,0
i made sure to order a size up but still to small returning them for a different brand,0
perfectly described and well protected product thank you,2
i returned these shorts because the padding wasnt where i needed it there was more padding on the butt than i needed and not enough further forward when leaning forward on a bike my weight isnt on my already naturally padded butt if you know what i mean,1
dont care for the clasp on the watch its was to small always thought it might fall off so i quit wearing it,1
stretches far too much after 8 hours of wearing doesnt breathe not as flattering as id like,1
difficult to put on without a shoe horn yet i bought a half size larger than usual i have a narrow 85 foot but this style made my feet appear extremely wide they are not what i expected and am returning,1
ive owned several pairs of sanuks and these are far inferior to others ive had,1
i like how different it is from most purses although it is very unstructured if that makes sense its not going to stand up anywhere think of it more as an attractive backpack,2
i should have left 1 star but the fit is pretty cute within the first five minutes of wearing it to try on fresh from the package the chain broke apart and the button holding it in place fell off it was an easy fix though,0
i would go a size up i was hoping the vneck was a little lower so not to show under my button down shirts it also seems to ride up sometimes so i have to adjust by pulling the shirt back down other than that its made with good quality,1
the hoops should be fine the screws are too small cant even get the curved part in to my piercing,1
these boots are absolute crap they appear to good enough for south florida winters if you drag your feet more than once you scrape the bottom off not recommended,0
so i will say im pregnant so nothing fits normally but i feel confident that this wouldnt be baggy on me even if i wasnt pregnant the space on the back is not as loose as the photo for example i can fit mediums i normally get larges when i want more space i should have got extra large to get the baggy look i had in mind,2
garbageuseless do not buy it,0
much smaller than other brand of a similar size,0
issues with sore feet and athletes feet socks absorb sweat,2
sleeves are too short,1
very comfortable socks and i think the price was quite good i would buy them again,2
my foot is a little wide so i could have purchased a 9 a little bit tight but wearable normally i wear 85 i would recommend this shoebr update after a few days of wearing it feels better on my feet,2
its cool i guess kind of ugly but cool,1
its ok smaller than i expected more like for a preteen,1
rides up,1
absolutely horrible product ears are glued crooked on the headband headband is very small sized for a toddler tail has a loop but no cord or elastic does not come with gloves not worth the price,0
really cute and comfy i absolutely loved these shorts bought 3 diff pairs when i first got them unfortunately if you have thicker thighs the inseam and crotch areas deteriorate and tear easily due to the thin material of the shorts theyre definitely not the type of shorts you can just wear all day oftentheyll wear out if they could reinforce the innerthigh and crotch area of these shorts with stronger material theyd be perfect,1
lots of compliments however the winder on the sides fell off of both of them great look and idea but a poor job on the mechanics wish they would have lasted,1
if youre looking for compression functionality to reduce feet swelling save your money these ones labeled as 1520mmhg didnt work at all if these are labeled correctly then 1520mmhg is insufficient compression to help counteract the swelling of my feet doctor recommended compression stockings next time will have to look specifically for the 2030mmhg to see if that level works better while putting onwearingtaking off these 1520mmhg feel no different from normal knee socks no feeling of added compression is apparent at all now i have 3 pairs of knee socks rather than compression socks as to the sizing i used their guidelines and got a size l and they loose and very long i had to fold them down at the top but then i am a 53 female,0
this is a cute dress but it was pretty shear for me it would be super cute for a swimsuit cover though go for a darker color and you may be okay,1
not what i was expecting its not an actual ear cuff its an eating because it is so heavy it does not stay up on your ear the way it is supposed to and when it arrived my package was damaged and the stud for the earring was missing dont recommend to anybody you could buy the same thing in a better quality for the same price at places like claires and hot topic,0
arrived on time we looked at many many many luggage sets after comparing the various features we settled on ferge im not familiar with this brand but it was a great purchase after we opened the amazon outer box we found that the interior box had been damaged on a corner piercing and crumpling the entire corner this gave me concern after opening the inner box we found only a scuff in that area the three hardshells came nested well packed and wrapped no problems so far the wheels are nice sturdy and roll smoothly the zippers are tight as they zip and the cases lay neatly on the provided feet when necessary i am impressed with the quality my daughter leaves for europe tomorrow and when she returns we will have a followup review,2
very disappointed in this product the plastic is white not clear so its very difficult to see through it also does not fold very well,0
bought this for a trip to ny in the winter and it was perfect i didnt have to carry my purse as there are so many pockets that i could put everything i needed in them and be purse free i ordered this in black because the green was sold out at the time and it worked out well i was worried about the sizing but went with a medium and it was the right choice i am 5634 and 136 lbs the side pockets were great for when i had to sit down or wanted a looser fit the lining in the hood is so soft and cozy i wore this in the snow and i never got wet and definitely stayed warm i most likely will be getting the green one too,2
i cant wait to wear it,2
satisfied,2
nice socks package had two of the same pattern time will tell if they hold up,1
should of been 2xbr more like medium to large,0
nice enough looking just to large in length,0
these are a little big but otherwise as expected,2
visually good look lets see how it works,2
this product was made in chinathe sizes are smaller that what it is listed,0
pretty colors ty,2
cute fit just right but the heels are sooooo flimsy i am afraid to wear them out they move a lot i might have expected this for a less amount but for the amount i paid i am disappointed they did arrive somewhat faster than other reviews complained about that was a plus,0
fabric is a bit thin but then again for the price it is what it is they are comfortable and not too long,1
material is very heavy for summer,1
cute top but the armholes are really small and uncomfortable i returned maybe it would work if you have teeny tiny arms i am 200 lbs 58 and 36ddd there was enough room for my chest but arm holes were way too tight,1
i have purchased the 34as seen on tv glasses which are wrap around and i like them but the lenses always fall out i decided to invest more money and purchase these and i love them they are a snug fit and even though they are not wrap around im not exposed to light from the sides im very happy with these glasses and they are definitely great quality,2
gift it was so pretty i wanted to keep it for myself gifted loves it,2
great,2
this was a very nice watch but unfortunately i have a small wrist and it was too big and i had to return it great easy return process thank you,1
any short sleeve shirt can be worn year round,2
too exspensive not to work,0
these earrings are beautiful the only thing that would improve this purchase is if the vendor included earring stoppers so they wont wiggle out of the earlobe other than that very happy with these wear them a lot,2
theyre perfect,2
make sure that you get the size you need because you cant return this it cost 300 just to return it because it comes from overseas,1
i waited almost 2 weeks to get this necklace only to receive a fake the stones are clear instead of pale green and the accents are solid black instead of hematite which is more grey there is also no stella dot little logo attached to the clasp of the necklace the one i received looks nothing like the one pictured here i have seen this necklace in person numerous times and i got ripped off big time im so mad right now i cant even tell you this fake isnt worth the 50 i guess its fact that if its too good to be true it probably is i only gave it 1 star because i had to give it a rating it doesnt even deserve that,0
terrible material lost all elasticity after one wear in the pool wish i could return it,0
felt like plastic,0
this bathing suit is adorable color is vibrant the waist and top band are cute the sizing it a wreck i ordered an xl since i typically wear a size 12 and the tops is very small and the bottoms are very big it is also cut more like lingerie than a bathing suit in between thong and bikini style bottoms,0
these are not high waisted and they are very thin and see through cheap material no i would not recommend these to anyone,0
it was cute but the sleeves were to tight,1
keeps my hands incredibly warm and dry while snowboarding i love the top zipper pockets perfect for adding extra hand warms my girlfriend kept stealing them because she love how nice her hands felt inside despite being overly sized will definitely purchase her a pair in the future,2
jacket description says it has a zip out liner this would make it a good choice for springfall or winter riding however after getting this jacket today 5 stars for shipping it does not have this option while the attached liner is not thick and will work well for cool weather it can not be removed,1
i first purchased a pair of the sandals blacksnakeskin 3 4 mos ago and left a glowing review i loved the look fit and most importantly the comfort of this twostrap sandal i give it a 5star rating in those categories but i will never buy this sandal again or recommend it because it has a design or manufacturing flaw it occurred in that first pair as well as the second one which i purchased only last month nov the first pair i used mainly to run errands and the second only for indoors the flaw appeared in both situationsbr imbedded in the rubber sole is a plastic or metal support frame it appears the melted rubber was poured over the frame to bond together after wearing the first sandals for 3 mos a portion of the rubber heel began to wear in a slant typical of that foot with only 14 or less worn down the frame was exposed so it meets the floor when i walk and it causes a clicking or tapping sound it was so annoying that i purchased a 2nd pair corkgold and decided i would only wear it inhouse so the bottom wouldnt get scuffed so quickly here it is only one month later and the same thing has happened the same corner of the rubber sole is barely worn and the imbedded frame is becoming exposed i am again making a clickingtapping sound like a pegleg while walking on tile either the rubber is too soft and wears easily or the manufacturer has not imbedded the frame deep enough into the rubber be forewarned,1
i like the color and pattern the fabric is soft and warm it appears it is put together well but it was just a tiny bit too small at my belly,2
these panties totally surprised me they are so lightweight that it is like wearing nothing but they are not nothing the slippery fabric feels so silky soft and as you put them on you grow to appreciate the stretchy fabric in front that expands a lot for an excited man the rear covers nicely and the leg elastic is gentle but firm enough to keep a relaxed man inside the panties no fallout these undies can be worn under any clothing shorts or slacks and show no vpl i have them in several colours and patterns the bright red skamps are a turn on for my lady and myself,2
i liked the jacket but the sizing is very small i usually wear a size 10 in tops but i couldnt even get this jacket zipped in the medium size i returned it and am deciding whether or not to reorder the same jacket in large i am hesitant due to the reviews that mention the really long sleeves the sleeves on the medium were too long for me but would have been ok if the rest of the jacket fit properly i didnt agree with other reviews that said the jacket was boxy it had a slightly tapered waist and other features that made it seem feminine,2
seriously too large its cute but it is so large that there is no keeping it on my wrist its probably between eight and 9 inches,0
1,2
good deal,1
my teenage daughter loves this dress could not wait to wear it thank you,2
i have used clarks for many years and something gone wrong with the company the products are not what they used to bebr br had to return,0
this dress was made out of non breathable material and had a very weird fit on the arms ended up returning probably made for a slimmer body type then i have br note im 54 and 175 and purchased the large,1
nice,2
my granddaughter loved this for christmas had to put it on immediately and didnt want to take it off it has the dress which was a little tight shes 3 but it stretches and the jacket is beautiful the leggings are great too keeps her from showing her behind lol,2
the underarms ripped after the first use it must have been faulty sewing by the manufacturer seller not at fault for this wish i could send it back but i am afraid it might be too late,0
great costume at a great price the material was great very well made and can be used over and overbr not like usual costumes,2
too tight around the bottom,0
cant beat these tuxedo shirts for the price i bought several for events that i have to go to frequently now and they were idealbr br theyre not too thin i live in new england but not too heavy such that a wellheated room doesnt roast me alive the pleating is subtle but well made and the optional buttoncufflink cuffs are a big advantage if i forget or lose a cufflink,2
my wife has a black gray and white striped turtle neck that she was hoping to wear under this sweater however it fits so strangely i dont think it will work at allbr br when she took it out of the package i noticed that the sleeves are really long i would expect this for a guys sweater but not for ladies it also seemed really wide in the shoulders like a mens sweater but the length seemed kind of short since it is 100 cotton knit we figured washing it would cause the sweater to shrink some so we gave it a shotbr br washing and drying the sweater didnt help at all the sleeves were still too long the shoulders too broad and the length was too short when the wife tried it on she said it was super loose around the waist like the ribbing comes prestretched out although she normally wears medium or large sweaters this one just looked baggy and shapeless on herbr br if you are a woman with long arms broad shoulders a wide girth and short waist then you may be able to wear this sweater however its not going to look good on most other women its just too frumpy and dumpy looking its not all that comfortable in the knit eithernot very soft that is the color is off as well being slightly beige rather than pure gray i definitely wouldnt recommend it for 30,1
the material of the luggage is very thin it feels very flimsy compared to other luggage in this price category i used it on a road trip from california to texas and the outside plastic started peeling if your looking for something affordable look at another option this one is only a matter of time until i break it and it is a disappointment,0
size was great and its a good material but it is hard to keep it in place my boyfriend dislikes this a lot on me bc it has no shape he calls it my bag dress the pockets do not stay in they constantly go out and look funky there is elastic around the top that makes it want to pull the top up around your neck instead of on one shoulder its comfy but not cute,1
these earrings are pretty nice very cute but not 3 long nor 13 wide as stated in the description they are actually only 2 34 inches long and only 78 wide i was disappointed gave them to my daughter,1
looks better on the pocture mine also stunk really bad i sprayed perfume to see if it goes away,1
this item looks to have a very low quality indeed after one week in the drawer yes i have not worn it at all or washed the white written is peeling off i cannot imagine what is going to happen when i will wash it,0
perfect fit very happy with these sneakers good arch support,2
the charis allure blazer is very smart looking the long lapel complements the ruched sleeves you have traditional pockets located on the front it fits true to size the color is a pretty green that reminds me of teal but maybe not with as much blue this jacket is pretty versatile it can be worn with a skirt slacks or even jeans it also complements a lot of colors black gray or blue it is comfortable the fabric is a polyester viscose blend overall this is a jacket that you can use for work or play,2
my husband loves these jeans and they fit him perfectly he is 160 pounds and 58 he is a true 32 love that these are so affordable online whereas they are 50 dollars at fred meyer,2
pants for well and are very comfortable cant wait to wear them to the festival wrong color was delivered and a replacement was sent to correct the mishap very quickly great customer service,2
i was pleasantly surprised the size small perfectly fit my petite 5 year old usually wears size 3 4 clothes and its always a plus when you can buy a complete costume instead of having to purchase everything separately and it was at a great price,2
i am 51134 and this was way too short it barely covered my toosh i returned it,0
it is way too thin and the color is not the same as displayed it had small black patches in the chain part not as i expected,0
these are awesome everyone loves them use them as patient safety glasses,2
i really wanted to like this product cute color button detail soft fabric however the fabric is very thin which caused two problems 1 my undergarments were visible through it and 2 im overweight and it showed off my problem areas i am returningbr edit i am normally a size l i ordered an xl and it was snug on me definitely order up,1
they fell apart to fast for the price i paid for them wouldnt recommend them,0
not as expected but ok,0
loved these but they broke after 2 months,1
these must have been mislabeled i ordered two other bras in the same size and they fit fine while these werent even close way too small,0
very thin and low cut my wife bought it and had to wear a t shirt underneath to have coverage would not recommend this shirt,0
be forewarned that a size large is a 1416 and very large there was no size chart when i ordered and need the dress for tomorrow so ill make it work but under other circumstances id have returned it for a smaller dress,1
good quality fabric seamless as advertised too long for a petite i am 5434 and they sag on me,2
i had lowered my expectations for these leggings because after all this ia internet shopping buy these they are super duper soft and thicker then i expected they really do stretch they are not loose when you put them on either they are not tight and uncomfortable they are literally the perfect leggings i am going to buy every single one they sell i cant find these in any stores they feel like they should be expensive just really quality leggings happy over here i bought the one size fits all not the plus size one size fits all my daughter who is 5ft 3in and weighs 160 tried them on and they fit her just as good so i gave them to her lol,2
im 54 and 155lbs i bought this dress as part of my halloween costume i bought a medium but probably should have bought a large as it is skin tight to me and difficult to zipper but its stretchy so it worked out however the white dress is incredibly see through and the material is thin it will work for a halloween costume but i couldnt wear this as an actual dress anywhere,1
my son is normally a size 13 i bought the size 1 thinking it was a good idea however it wasnt the boots are way too big its best to order there exact size however the inside of the boots feel really warm but they felt a bit on the heavy size,1
well made fits well beautiful fabric,2
fit as expected long lasting i have bought others till i got this one and no need to try any others,2
this has not yet been used since receiving it though it looks and feels good the very strong dye smell is offensive as a result it has been airing out since it was received,1
i ordered the size indicated but it was too small in the bust,1
very comfortable nice color,2
shirt area fit great but the straps were too long so it hung lower than where i wanted it to so i dont wear it and missed the return period if you have a short neck to chest area i wouldnt recommended getting because youll be swimming in the straps,1
sized up based on the other reviews but it was comically enormous i have big boobs too but it was way too big might try to reorder in a size or 2 smaller otherwise its okay pretty cheap material,1
wrong color was sent,0
if you have a width waist looking from back this is not for us front top part is flattering looks and fits pretty but it just top part bc from the back in ur waist area it looks really bad is more for a good shape body for reference i got a blush color in m is a see through am 411 ft with 147 pounds fits too long cute color but am returning it is not for me,0
this is a beautiful ring and it fits well my photos dont do it justice and my hands look terrible in the photos but this ring sparkles like crazy its a pretty ring anyway but if youre under some lights it is gorgeous the way the light catches the crystals and makes them sparkle it looks like real diamondsbr br ive worn this ring every day for a week to work out to dinner out shopping every time someone sees it they always comment about my very beautiful ring and ask where i got it one lady called me a very lucky girl whn she saw this ringbr br i ordered my size and it fit perfectlyplus it is comfortable sometimes because of my allergies i cant wear rings that arent gold but so far i havent had any problems with this ring which is fortunate because i love it and everyone who sees it seems to love it too i havent had any issues with stones falling out and ive accidentally hit my hand on multiple things like the door frame to my bedroom im a bit on the clumsy sidebr br if youre looking for a pretty ring with a low pricetag instead of the real thing this is a great alternative its beautiful and sparkles like real diamonds and is very comfortable for your every day wear why tell people that its only crystal when everyone thinks its realbr br disclaimer i received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review if this review helped you please hit 34like34 thanks,2
i have had good luck with other apparel from amazon but this shirt was so cheap the fabric is the cheapest polyester on the market and it shows from a distance it appears flowy and airy but up close it is a scratchy extremely low end fabric that looks and feels truly awful,0
does not keep perfect time runs slow my son has to fix once a week,0
great looking coin,2
putting on this shirt left me speechless doesnt hang like the photo at all i cant even begin to describe how unflattering this was and in such a strange way i cannot recommend it 2stars instead of 1 because the material wasnt horrendous,0
normally this style of hat looks great on me this one is just ever so slightly too small but still works if i pull it down really hard over my head i have an antique hat stretcher i plan to try on it,1
,1
its not what i expected,0
ordered in red and color ran a lot it says it came from a company called elite hero allegedly a veteran yet it was made in pakistan a country not known to be on our side bought similar tshirt at walmart by fruit of the loom and color did not run short sleeves were longer and length was longer than shirt purchased here and half the price,1
these are by far the best socks i have ever owned in my life i have already bought more and have thrown out all of the other socks in my sock drawer they are well worth the money because my feet have not hurt since i started wearing them i would highly recommend these especially the big guys with big calves,2
not exactly what i expected,1
top is a bit small and lacks support so i have to tie the tie straps in the back extra tight which doesnt help in the too small problem,1
my packet contained four instead of 3 shortsbr i guess i shouldnt complain but the problem was only two of them had tartan check prints as seen on the site the other two see photo the middle two were plain bright coloured pieces which i definitely did not wantbr so i have returned the packet,1
i wore these about 3 or 4 times before they came un sewed they were cute to wear around the house and run errands in just wish they would have lasted longer,1
although this is a cute necklace and a good price the cz is very small,1
i bought this hoodie based upon the sizing information choosing xl because the chest size is listed a 256 across meaning it would be 53 inch chest my chest is 48 so i figured this would be good all i can say is that this was one of the most missized garments i have ever purchased i couldnt even get it on so i figure it was really about a large at best the hoodie was marked as an xl so buyer bewarebr the other con is that the sleeves were ridiculously short i wear a 3435 sleeve length in a dress shirt and i have never purchased a hoodie or sweatshirt with sleeves so short that they are 2 inches above my wrist these hoodies are made in china so perhaps they did not accurately account for arm length sizing charts in the us when they made the pattern anyway i am going to give this to my wife who is only 5 feet tall,0
it looked like it was used and the quality is cheap hot trash a cheap hooker would wear i didnt try it on,0
umbrella itself is nice color is much different then picture shown not a fan,1
i hope tat this reaches the seller that sold me this timex indiglo watch it is the correct watch that i wanted however in the picture it shows an expansion band this one came with a complicated clasp with no instructions on how to adjust the wrist band i tried to wear it by pushing up on my arm until it felt snug the next thing i know the watch falls off my arm dont buy,0
liked the color but the top was kind of small in size,1
i was excited to get this upon looking at it i was really pleased it seemed like a well made sporty shirt trying it on the fit is great but material is eh i am disappointed that the material is felting so quickly before the 1st wash,1
groovy,2
great products,2
too big dont want a second order want my money back,0
fits but definitely on the smaller side id order up a size personally material is thin so be ready to wear something under it perfect for a pool cover up though,1
ive been wearing timex watches for 36 years ive never been disappointed with them until now i bought this one earlier this year to replace my previous watch which had been faithful for 12 years the buttons on this watch the start split button most of all are sluggish and cumbersome they dont respond as well or as reliably as they should the start button is so rough that ive actually gone backwards to set timers by using the back button rather than try to push it forward ive had this watch for less than 1 year and the indiglo light button is now dead i dont do anything with the watch that would be considered strenuous or damaging to it obviously my last one survived for 12 years now im seeking a replacement for this watch and i will definitely not be getting another of the same i dont recommend you do either,0
i was a little nervous ordering this because of some of the reviewsbut i couldnt be happier with the fit length style and colors are great i say colors because after i received the first one i ordered 4 more in different colors i highly recommend,2
easy to put in and they look great,2
cheaply made broke after a couple of days wearing them cute but thats about all,0
ordered these for a friend and she really seems to like them,2
after reading reviews i did order up 1 size and the fit is perfect they are not sheer at all and there is just enough fleece lining to help keep warm so glad i ordered,2
cute everyday look,2
these dont look as good as the picture look more like knotted up silver wire and they were completely different sizes too with one being bigger that the other was supposed to be a gift but it looks crappy and cheap,0
much bigger all around then expected very cute and made well just on the larger size all around,1
too small and no arch support,1
comfortable and they are ideal for work shoes but not make you hot like the non cotton ones do,2
too small,0
ok,1
they look great but they broke really easily,1
i purchased one pair in black and everyone commented on the shoes i went back and found this model and purchased them they are lovely little shoes that enhance any casual outfit i did not expect to get arch support i purchased exactly what i wanted for the purpose that suits summer you may want a softer inner sole for more comfort the shoes may take a little while to get here if the size and style is not readily available worth the wait id say lets not forget the bargain price and the artistry in the shoes it is a good deal,2
i think i have an average length torso this was short for my torso and the bracups fit so strangely like very close together it is a cheaper suit and it definitely looks and feels that way i ordered 2 cupshe suits and both went back this was the worst fit of the 2,0
mostly would recommend for use on fairly cold days or for brief trips outside on very cold days so for example if you work outside and the weather is in the fifties this jacket will be the right temperature for you or at least it is for me i wore this jacket while parking my car and making my way to an airport terminal in belowzero weather and was ok for about 1520 minutes any longer the jacket wouldve been irrelevant its not a winter coat its a jacket but its a good onebr br zipper is sturdy no issues or problems with zipper,2
i picked up a package from murdochs as they were on clearance and my hubby loved them so much i got him another package carhartt is amazing but hey we already know that cheers,2
these are thin and terribly made would not recommend,0
crap quality iron onshirt,0
when i walk occasionally they do bend at the front of the shoe and it could become a problem i do like how i can adjust the fit at the front of the sandal to make it secure as well as the arch support for the latter two reasons i do find them a nice shoe for walking are they a slightly lower than a 4000 i think that would have been a bit much i was lucky to be able to get the special price i would have bought more pairs at that price but not a approx 4000,2
a solid sports bra with quality features the high end material leaves nothing irritating fabric is soft and smooth on skin a must in such a delicate area when combining rigorous activity nothing to rub or chafe elastin is tight provides very strict compression so i definitely size up if intensity like this bothers you overall bra seems to run about 12 size small either by cut or compressionbr br perfect finishing details with reinforced stitching the dual straps are stitched to lay flat and stay that way no twisting or tangling while wearing or putting on if youve ever used a multi strap that twist flip or roll when worn you know the benefit to having straps stitched into place overall this provides user solid support along with the ample compressionbr br great shelf system loving the 15 band it creates an ideal shelf to hold up and support the girls a great for bigger chested women who do not want wires of any kind removable pads are also a perk if already packing some heat removing pads slims down the bustline nicely yet the fit still provides expected support during workoutbr br as for washing cold temperatures placed in a lingerie bag and line dry doing so will keep bra from unwanted shrinkage andor tangling up in gears or other clothing items to prolong life of any spandexelastin you should keep it out of synthetic heatbr br overall this has focus on functionality and finish quality which brings the higher price point you just need to ensure the fit to get what you want from this tyr sports bra hoping info can help your decision stay safe everyonebr for reference ordered m for 57 131lb 34c 22yr old removing pads helped provide more room but large would have been better option for overall comfort,2
these are robust and relatively wide though they seem pretty 4e to me for a 5e shoe when i really need an 8e that cannot be foundbr theyre not comfortable and i get blisters in them when walking long distances not matter what i try to do with laces a problem i do tend to have but can normally sort out by adjusting thingsbr i wanted shoes that lasted longer than the nb shoes i normally have to buy because noone else makes shoes even remotely wide enough but these arent wide enough are uncomfortable even compared to other not wide enough shoes and have generally underwhelmed me they do seem to be built to last but thats the only thing keeping their rating from slipping furtherbr they appear to be as waterproof as they claim,1
not able to use back of item poked me to the point i could only wear for 3 mins,0
if i would have known before purchasing that it would take 21 days to deliver i wouldnt have purchased and being from china it fits too snug to my head,1
yow either these run small or i somehow purchased a childs size i usually wear a 68 or a mens xs depending on the brand i cant even get my hands into these im guessing the xsmalls would probably fit a 6 year old if that helps you with sizing otherwise they really seem like theyre quality made with good materials no loose stitching etc id recommend but size up,1
love the wuality,2
nice white elephant gift,2
jesus,1
i ordered a similar pair of pj bottoms on amazon in the same size and they were flowy and loose these were very tight in the thigh area i bought them to wear as maternity pjs but they definitely will be too tight in the third trimester unfortunately i had to return them,0
this iris lilly womens wireless padded cotton bra is very cute but is not true to size the band is very small and tight even on the loosest setting the inner corners of the cups and where they meet in the middle sticks out too much when it should lay flush against the skin if you like this bra you will need to size up on the band im disappointed that i cant wear this,1
fits great and is warm,2
when i opened this i was in love i was so happy with this dress and the fit was right on its very light and airie if ya get me i would wear a slip under it cause its that light but the flowers on this the pic gives it no justice i like that it has the over jacket thats the same color as the flowers on the dress now i thought it was gonna be a green but it was really a shade of blue and i feel in love with it i had no problems with the seller and would buy from them again very fast on the shipping and thats a plus for me,2
surprising quality for a very low price we plan on wearing these in mexico guess why,2
fits just right and love the look as seen in ybr the photo,2
bad quality,0
i usually fit large but the waist was super tight and made it a little uncomfortable and hard to breathe the leg part was a good fit though maybe the pants are telling need that i need to lose more weight lol,1
llego mucha antes de lo esperado muy buena calidad muy bonita,2
nice shirt but cut too short i like the color and feel of the shirt but its too short for me and i have to return it no way it would stay in a pair of pants when tucked in,1
i loved the colors and the designs of these socks was very excited for my new knee highs unfortunately the material provides absolutely no stretch i wear size nine shoes and these should have fit according to the description but they wouldnt fit my ten year old niece i couldnt even get them over my ankles i would not recommend these to anyone with normal human sized feet you will regret it i returned them immediately,0
it is a stunning dress and the maroon color is beautiful great quality fabric but just too small i wear a 46 in us clothes and ordered this in a medium could barley get it zipped up will probably reorder in a large,2
love the fit except for the length much too long and im tall 58,2
i brought these boots loven the way the look and the other 2 client reviews were great i just started daten my boyfriend and he has a motorcycle i thought great i will have a new pair of cute bike boots to wear around with him well sunday we did a motorcycle run and it was a big cook out after at a local bar i wore them from 730am630pm so my feet were a killing me which i expected with new shoes what i did not expect was to step off the bike and have the heel break off not only that but a little bit of sand hit my foot and the leather peeled this boot is awful i have never been so upset with a purchase ever,0
great shorts love the material name brand,2
excellent quality and beautiful feminine belt,2
tore after 3 weeks of wear would not recommend,0
this is exactly what i was looking for the perfect size purse and delivery was super fast definitely getting another one in a different color,2
great quality fit and comfortable,2
definitely not made for the covid 19 pandemic dont buy,0
most of my jackets coats etc are xl the same size as this one was supposed to be they all fit well however this one is a little bit small i wont be able to wear it with much more than a tshirt but for the price its ok,1
great socksthey were a big hit,2
i love the style so much 2 days later l whenbr back on amazon and bought another pair lol and thinking about getting another pair no joke they are color jet black and l love dark black,2
these are craft key chains,0
first the good i bought three of these belts to replace the cheaper looking belts that came with my shorts they look great the buckle looks good i am very happy with the way they look two drawbacks to these though first is they stretch so much that they are purely just for looks if you are looking for something to actually hold your plants in place this wont do it second problem is they stretched out and are now way too big and the ends just hang down i should have gotten a much smaller size to account for stretching,1
this is a great layering piece i bought one in a different color last year and purchased another its quite a value i may end up with another before too long,2
wouldnt recommend no support and very wide,0
this bracelet is beautiful the stones are very pretty and the black small stones in the back seem to sparkle like they hold stars and galaxies inside of them i love this bracelet it is so pretty and totally worth buying i wear it everywhere and i have had it for over two months now,2
boyfriend liked itnot well madehad to glue metal clasp back onto leather again nice for money spent,1
this sweater is a big hit i love it it fits true to size i am 178 lbs and 57 and i got an xl and it fits perfectly,2
me agrado el producto estoy satisfecho,2
runs small and very thin,1
did not receive the bag pictured very disappointed this product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review,0
i loved the outfit when it arrived for so well however after first wash the fabric looked worn and used started to look as if i had it for years threw it away,0
these take a little getting used to i bought a 65 and can wear them with no socks so then i bought a 7 and its better however they run tight across the top of my foot and im nearly flat footed,2
just now received these glasses and one of them has a defect or scratch in both lenses it looks looks like they have a chip on one side and scratch on the other like they were used the purple are a really pretty color but the pink isnt very pink,0
i really love this shirt it has a sort of dramatic feel i normally wear a medium and this shirt fits exactly as expected i got quite a few complements from strangers while wearing it around town,2
stretchy,1
robe is soft and comfortable but sleeves are so wide they tend to get in the way,1
i originally purchased size xl as the asian sizing is not us dad bod sizing the xl was slightly to large for my 165lb 58 majestic frame i kept this xl as i can easily wear a base layer under it for fallwinter rides i purchased a large also this was better summer fit and much shorter in the tail section ive attached picture for comparison xl vs l also fyi im married ladies sorry very good for the money,2
beautiful,2
this eyeglass chain arrived in a baby blue envelope with a satin ribbon inside was the gold snake chain an extra set of connectors for your glasses and a cleaning cloth i am wearing them now after years of misplacing my eyeglasses bifocals and now dont have to worry about that what a relief,2
update these are junk ive only had them a couple months one of my lens already popped out as i was trying to clean them i wasnt even putting that much pressure i wish i could return them save your money and invest in better qualitybr br these glasses are just ok they are polarized in where they make your phone look funny if you look at it with them on but they dont do much for the sun compared to the old sunglasses i had i got these for early morning and late evening driving when the sun is right in your face they dont help much and i still find myself using the visor they are cheap so i guess you get what you pay for nothing special,0
great product speedy delivery,2
im a touch under 53 tall normally wear a small i got this in a large so i could layer it for the cooler weather it arrived i tried it on the fabric is very uncomfortable very light weight its nearly see through part of what makes this so uncomfortable is that the seam is stitched right down the center of the back i then put this on with a fitted t under it that resolved the uncomfortable aspect but with the fabric being so light it is a rather pointless garment its nearly fall with a fitted t under this it was way too warm when it is cool out it will not be warm enough if the fabric was at least comfortable i would have turned this into a sleep shirt but there is no way i can wear this on my bare skin the sleeves are okay its just the torso section if all of this wasnt bad enough it looks awful ladies this is not the least bit flattering id forgive that if it was keeping me comfy warm but ugly without purpose is just well pointless,0
fabric very thin cut of garment not stylish string around waist too heavy for the waistband looks cheap,0
it looks good but very poorlymade skip it,1
its linen so its off white and very light weight fabric will work for summer but not the bright white pop i was expecting,1
wrong fit returned item didnt get refunded 10 days after return,0
they were a little larger than i expected but theyre still cute and i love them,2
didnt know that much about israeli dress and customs thought it would be much bigger than this and cover my bald spot will shave my head and see how it fitsnot worn to fool anybody theres no synagogues in my neighborhood,1
ripped the first time i wore it on both side seams and it wasnt really 34tight34 just my normal size bad quality material,0
this cover up runs small i also thought it said cotton not syntehticy6 but it is cute,1
shocked that large is larger than most i think if i order more shirts from this place i will go down a size every time the shirt is screened on hanes or some other generic brand and feels boxy,1
as others have mentioned they run small and definitely not size 911 i wear an 8 12 shoe us sizing and my heel will not fit all the way into the cushioned heel cup even after stretching and pulling i believe this is why several reviewers indicate the socks wear out or come apart quicklyits because your heel is not fitting in the cushioned heel cup instead part of the heel is sitting on the looser weave sock material that should be on the ankle area and not the heel im returning as they are too small they are also uncomfortable in the toe area due to the way they are sewn see photo this presses and rubs against the toe when wearing shoes,0
i ordered a black it looks more like charcoal to me i need if for work asap and cant wait for an exchange so i guess ill wear it but an okay buy just wish i received black as ordered,1
great experience with the seller my daughter needed the dress sooner and the seller was kind enough to expedite it to me the dress is beautiful thank you so much,2
it is very cute set you get five ring the color variation is very subtle from close it looks like it has been made from low quality material it have brassy metallic odor to it which is quite strong when you wear it i used a layer of clear nail polish to mask the odor,1
didnt get 12 pieces only got 6,0
broke off in my hand,0
very pleased with this purchase,2
i read the size guide and reviews before purchasing to make sure i would be getting a size that would fit me sadly when i first tried them on they were too large i am going to be exchanging it for the size down so that they dont fall down while wearing thembr br other than the size the fabric is nice quality the pants are breathable but still not super thin they seem very comfortable if you have the correct size,1
the item is not true to size my husband is a 34 and we still ordered a size up and it came too small,0
i like these leggings a lot im a yoga teacher and also the retail manager at a yoga studio that carries high end yoga brands so ive tried on lots of brands styles price points etc these really inexpensive leggings are right on par with a lot of the brand that cost 4 times as much super opaque light weight enough for hot classes and have a really good smooth feeling my only complaint was that i am almost always a small in leggings56 138lbs size 24 in pants and these were a little bit big around my waist hips and inner thighs they probably arent noticeably big to anyone else but i like my leggings to stay were they should and i had to pull these up a few times during practice still a great legging though ordered the xsmall so ill update once i get them,2
the image matches four that i have the description indicates they are made of 100 cotton the description also says they are spandex i wanted cottoni received spandex not good,0
bought 2 sets on accident returned one no problem loved them much ended up buying the second set,2
i like this as a tightfitting shirt to wear while swimming,2
i love this bra very comfortable i will purchasing this bra in different colors in the future,2
it fades after a couple of months,1
absolutely adore these pants,2
i had ordered these and they were really tight the waist wasnt an issue but the leg parts of them felt really tight luckily there is a return policy and i didnt get stuck with them,0
nice looking runs small in the bust,1
i do not like,1
since ive been working exclusively from home ive prioritized comfort ive been wearing sports bras most of the time but i didnt like the constant compression or the fact that the racerback meant the straps were visible even in a basic crew neck top so then i bought wire free bras but they didnt provide much shape or support these are perfect the material is so soft no bulky seams no narrow trim that digs or rolls the pads provide some pushup and shape that you would otherwise get from a bulkier more structured or wired bra i just hope they dont stretch out straps arent adjustable but thats fine for now fits perfectly,2
absolutely gorgeousbr thats all i can say,2
i love this outfit but the sleeves are very small the top was nice and shorts very lovely color and satin yet sleeves cut was weird and very narrow,1
lasted a month till the buckle broke off the cheap probably not leather leather while i was buckling it,0
ok this mask is really cool to look at with that being said it is so uncomfortable for long periods of time the ridge of the nose is hard and puts pressure in a single spot leaving a huge dent in your face if its worn for 10 minutes i also decided to switch out the spikes on the sides of the nose since they blocked my eyes so i unscrewed them and replaced them with smaller spikes the mask also gets really bad condensation inside from wearing it and it gets wet smell is a little unpleasant too it reminds me of a cheap halloween mask and really you cant breathe in it at all its also heavy and the straps dont like to hold it to your face alone aside from the discomfort of actually wearing it it does look cool and works best for photos which is why i bought it if youre looking for a mask to wear in this pandemic i wouldnt recommend it,1
for usa size its to small does not fit i ordered a 2x still too small,1
size does not coincide with charts,0
i like the sun glass but i did not get the complete bonus that i ordered i did not get the cleaning kits that was advertise,0
the boot is very comfortable but come apart in no time the glue that the cute little tread fails before they have been in service for a year comfortable but crap for wear,1
so beautiful the earrings are made very well a pleasant surprise thank you,2
the quality of the leather is very poor peels and cracks after a few uses junk,0
nice material but a bit big,1
they look pretty sturdy but they are too small for my full grown chickens,0
i was not able to carry it oni have to check it init didnt fit the carry on,1
need a smaller size cuz by my wrist is small and customers dont always have a very big wrist so you really need to make every sizesmoney wise is good,1
the socks were to small for me definitely asian clothing size and the color printing was pretty far off of the image on the display probably should have expected it though product didnt have many review and no stars would have loved if the product had been clearer in the discription of what it was,0
these look ok and i thought they would be decent quality but only washing them a few times i already see tiny hole forming in the fabric they are not holding up to 1x a week washing and only lasted about 45 weeks or 45 washings i wont purchase these again,0
i am happy with the next day service i bought the glasses to lower glare while night driving as the new brighter headlights create more glare for me the glasses do lower the glare the clip on glasses do help reduce glare and are good quality i only received one amber clip on i am not unhappy with the purchase i just thought the advertisement should not say two pack,1
i really love this watch its very stylish and goes with everything face is easy to read as well which is a bonus,2
i do love the style the pattern and that its a cream color and not completely bright white but i thought it was a a mid thigh high it reaches just above my knees and thats if i really pull them up which i really really dont like theyre also very uncomfortable and too tight above the knee i usually read comments to make sure of this but i really liked the style so i took a chance the material is not very nice either a little bit rough for my liking and its also a little too thin as the socks stretch you can kind of see through it i weigh 130 and im 53 im not too thick im very average so its definitely the socks them selves either way thigh highs are always nicer with a softer stretchy material that you can always throw on these socks in particular are very uncomfortable and unattractive i have attached a photo the lighting is very bad in my room but in the photo you can see how ugly they look as they dent in tightly above my knee,0
order up a size or two if you want it to fit like the picture what i received is definitely not the same print or cut around the neck its more like a mini tank up top it fit me like a bodycon dress i ordered the small but the medium would look too sloppy up top under the arms,1
they are lightweight for sure but this was a gift and shoe were not new used send in random box also both lace clips missing,0
i love the fit of these pants but unfortunately only a few months into wearing theyre bally and old looking really poor quality and not cheap my advicetry something else if this is what youre looking for very disappointed,0
cheap fabric weird fit unattractive,0
im 5 feet110 lbsi order size smalli got it and only fitfor todlerpiece of crap dont waste your money buying this,0
color is blue and and yellow in hue looks weird,0
it definitely didnt not meet my quality expectations they are kinda cheap looking while i understand that these are inexpensive ive purchased cheap jewelry that looks better than these,1
i do love it but i could have gone a size smaller,2
ran way too small in the legs and hips the jeans would be better fitting for someone that is petite,0
runs huge i got a small and was sad i had to return it,1
the bottom seams ripped after a couple of months i had to sew it back,1
first shipment was great ordered a second the second was 2 sizes too small try to returnto china ha nope ridiculous amount of money to return item they profit i have an unusable item,1
fitflop is always a nice fit but the leather on this shoe stretches beautiful design but did not expect that flaw,1
looks cheap,0
didnt shrink after dryer but fabric has hole in it after 3 days,1
it was impossible to put on your ear and broke easily thank goodness i only paid a dollar for it,0
i liked the bags but they didnt last long at all they fell apart with only a outfit in it,1
ripped fast,0
size is to small compared with same size same brand,0
bought this for my brother we are lifetime kc chief fans and of course love our qb i thought he would just look at me and think i had lost my mind wish i could post his picture because he does wear it every once in a while for a few minutes on game days and took it on a family skiing vacation we havent seen him with a full head of hair for many years and to our surprise he looks great with it on its been a surprisingly fun gift,2
is comfortable but gives you uniboob,0
very poorly made as soon as i opened the package a pieceteeny tiny bolt went flying off of it when i finally found the said teeny tiny bolt i tried putting it back on but it wouldnt stay even if it had stayed the ring is sooo thick you really cant wear it not to mention it is extremely hard to open not sure if there is an original one out there that is better made wish i could find it this is being returnedbr tip do not open on a marbled countertop next to a toaster you havent cleaned under recently,0
the dress is beautiful but it is very long i am 5344,1
literally the lowest quality garment i have ever purchased these are poorly made essentially singleuse expect seams to open leg band elastics to snap and for them to fall apart the first time you wear them the worst underwear ive ever worn the fabric is not soft out of the package and is thin weak gauzelike and tears easily the picture i have attached speaks for itself these were worn for about an hour then thrown away i guess at this price 150pair disposable is the intent expect to throw out four out of five pairs after one wearing garbage not recommended,0
my husbands head is big it fits but wish he had a little more room nice hat,2
the necklace came and one of the beads was already broken off it so annoying,0
run way big had to return dont like the way the neck fits,0
im sure the watch is fantastic been waiting for 3 months for my order to process,1
great purse convenient,2
waste of my money i wouldnt recommend these to anyone thought they were going to be great however looks are certainly deceiving left slipper is great but the right one came completely defective when slid on my foot i end up walking on the side of the entire slipper its literally at the point of being extremely dangerous due to the fact its made me fall more than once very uncomfortable dangerous im extremely upset i wasted money on them id return them but im in the middle of a move have too many things to do to worry about going through amazons return process,0
fabric is looks different than the image on their description the quality is not worth the price,0
okay,1
it runs a little on the big side,1
i bought 2 pair of similar pants and waited to compare i liked the first pair but wasnt really impressed they were just okbr then these arrived today not impressed out of the package then i put them on wow so comfortable and look great i wore them to work and just came home and ordered 2 more pairbr im sure ill be ordering every color highly recommend this buybr update yeah i now have 7 pair of these pants i love how they feel and after washing i see no noticeable shrinkage they come out of the dryer just like new no wrinkles at all fantastic deal,2
so soft comfortable and irritating to the right people,2
i needed a very large duffel life vests and seats that go with our kayak only time will show how well it was made,2
if i ever had high hopes for a shirt and was disappointed this one would be it the material is so soft and the design is so beautiful but it is obviously made for little girls i got an extra large and it barely fit over my chest period im 56 150 lbs and most shirts i order are large or xlman i wanted this shirt please make bigger sizes because your size chart cant be for adult women,0
very poorly made bad instructions looks cheap is cheap,0
the jeans did not flatter my fat belly or big legs they felt good when i put them on but definitely did not look flattering,0
dismal quality fabric is thin and not durable it pilled after 1 wearing too bad because the fit and design was what i was looking for as well as the color but the fabric and finishing is horrible you get what you pay for i guess,0
i got these to wear under my helmet since i own a motorcycle keeps me warm enough and can even wear it on a hot day because the material used allows air to breeze through my whole head,2
there are two versions of this hat one is made in the usa and the other is made in china i bought the usa hat first and then bought the china version unknown to me at that time the made in china version label stitching was off center and the hat was slightly smaller the usa version was better fitting and the label had cleaner stitching the n is new london looked like a m,0
sooooo so small i usually wear a 4 these i cant get over my thighs,0
fit small for a xl,0
this womens ethinc boho cardigan coat long open front midlength wool coat sweater aztec tribal tassel fringe thin coat is a joke not at all like how it was described,0
they was a little tight need to be bigger,1
the pants are comfortable but very very loud walking around in thempeople can hear you coming from far off,1
great product,2
love the pants for work i have to wear heels to keep from dragging ground im 52,2
the material used is very thin there is a little stretch to it but it fits more baggy than most camis ive worn in the past it fit as expected but because it lacks stretch it wears loosely,1
bought for my grandson he loved it,2
my husband loves this shirt for working out or for sleeping,2
i ordered one size up but it is still pretty tight i would recommend ordering two sizes up,1
my husband loves sons of anarchy ok i do too and i wanted to get him something he would use that had something soa on it and after searching found this hat this knit beanie is good quality it is heavy enough to keep his head and ears warm and he has worn it every morning on his travel to work even during the dreaded polar vortex period when it was 20 with wind chill i think it keeps him warm but personally thinks he really likes to wear it because it makes him tough like jax or one of the other soa members in his mind i would definitely buy this again,2
looks good with school uniform,2
i am 59 plus long waisted and this shirt did not flatter me at all it looks cute on shorter people for sure but did not look nice or fall in the right places,1
love the style but poor quality fabrics,1
poor quality the color and material are like a mans under shirt,0
i bought a large n its so tight i couldnt get it over my chest this is not sized for us women it comes directly from china,0
its okay ill keep it but not what i was looking for a nascar t with no logo on the back are you kidding me what the point,1
beautiful but the elastic was weak and stretched easily,1
nice scarf but the color in the picture is different from actual i didnt like the actual color and returned it was too bright,0
fits great and i bought the petticoat to go under and it looks great,2
shrunk after a couple of washes,1
beautiful jewelry fits well and looks well made great value,2
product smells like chemicals even after i aired it out for a while im embarrassed i gave one as a gift,0
much too small,0
i have not had arch pain or leg back pain since i started wearing these shoes i just bought another pair actually thats how much i loved these shoes great quality,2
way too small and the length was way too short i ordered an extra size up too still fit bad,0
its ok,1
a gorgeous lightweight scarf perfect for springsummer wear the fabric is soft so the scarf is a pleasure to wrap around your neck works great as a wrap too some ladies could easily use this as a swimsuit cover or sarong the deep mediterranean blue color and intricate pattern on the ikat scarf remind me of the greek isles highly recommended,2
i use this to hid away my cash between bank trips im a server so i constantly have cash this was perfect size and easy to stow away,2
nice shoe bags great for cleats or sport shoes too definitely happy with this purchase,2
love they are so comfy and sooooo cute i wore them out dancing and then with a pair of jeansthese just work in so many combinations love them,2
after 2 days the band separated from the clip can no longer use would not recommend,0
it was okay,1
ripped within a few days of using it it was very pretty but i wish it was made of stronger material,0
clip bent and ready to break off junkbr not worth the time or money too orderbr look around and find something better,0
house slipper were too small i need 85 or 9,0
cute but had scratches,0
nice red color very comfortable shoe fits nicely,2
material is weird no give at all have to return unfortunately bc i really wanted pants with pin tuck ill keep looking,1
did not like this watch it looks cheap returned,0
love the set great for price and select style simple great buy,2
the back strap going over the back heel doesnt fit properly on the upper heel,0
hard to get info on the panels and no cover to protect personal info,0
i love pants like these cause theyre stretchy and comfortable while looking really nice i just was expecting the pair i chose to be more purple instead of very pink but the difference in color aside im pleased with my pants,2
way too big it may fit her in 5 to 6 years smh,0
so great same if not better than the lulus i am so happy i found these,2
great quality for the money super cute and fits as expected,2
bottoms have no support for the buttocks,1
sent it back because it was too small for my head and there was this weird cowlick thing in the front great for kids costumes but probably not for cosplay,0
the glasses seemed well made but did not improve night driving at all i spent an hour driving last night and tried the glasses comparing them to no glasses in various nighttime driving situations from city to zero ambient light in the country in every condition they reduced my visible distance by about 20 the naked eye was always more effective and allowed me to see farther with clarity this is my second pair of night driving glasses lost my first pair the first pair worked far better than these,0
the kids and there friends use them they dont complain,2
i didnt like the quality of this bag returned it,1
great buy very strong anklet great buy,2
size up or 2,1
i tried this in a large to extra extra extra large and all the sizes inbetween and these bras fit me perfectly in any of those sizes without much difference in feel or tightness i got these to help reduce swelling after surgery and this is working perfectly for me i also love the lilac color unfortunately this one arrived with very poor side stitching it looks like someone sewed the sides by hand as can be seen from the photo other than this they are the same as every other one i orderedbr br note that they wash well in a lingerie bag but i lay them flat to dry,1
i love the look of this watch however it does not storebr much wind have to make sure it gets movement everybr day or it stopsbr br also it is fast a few minutes a daybr br nice to look at not much of a watch,1
i purchased this product for my friends seems they it came a bit smaller than expected but to be on fair side i am not the right to rate it,1
fit was as expected however i am petite and had to shortenbr but it did not ruin the shape of the pants as it sometimes does when you have to shorten pants i am pleased with it and have worn twice to the gym since i received them,2
i love the color but the dress doesnt have any stretch i have a high waist so the dress is too short if i pull the waistline to where it should be im five two,1
it was too small for me and not as spiffy as the picture the brims looked wider than those of the real product fortunately the hat was a fair fit for my wifeso we are not returning it,1
i have had the ring for about 8 months wearing it every day it started out really gold but has faded to a dark silver now really comfortable doesnt look bad silver,1
this is the second pair ive purchased i wore the first pair out uber comfy and fits as expected,2
it just fits and it hasnt been cleaned yet i have a feeling its a one time shirtbr another draw back not clear in photos in the bottom is not straight its like a dress shirtyuck,1
perfect support i just ordered a second pair i wear them all day and i put on the miles and in the morning i do not feel my plantar f the trick is just always have them on even in the house,2
it fits better then the other one coz got bigger size so i like,1
too short in the torso would give zero stars if i could,0
not a good fit,1
eh too stiff from the start only one side is decorated and not what i was hoping to get,0
mismatched bent and dirty,0
they hurt my ears,0
i loved the product it is really useful in rainy days i recommend this item,2
although it is very comfortable and looks niceit is not really water resistantafter less than 7 month 1 of the strap holders came off and the other is close to coming offi would say the reason is wateri shower with my watch on,0
this shirt in the xl is literally almost as long as a dress because i have a tummy and this shirt is super clingy it shows everything the material is soft and the buttons are great quality for reference purposes i am 59 and 189lbs i cant wear this shirt however as it is so unflattering long and not what i thought it would be on me anyway,0
its really flattering until your boobs come falling right out of it not great for busty women it slides back over my bra so id end up walking around with my bra on display if i wasnt paying attention and constantly adjusting the triangle top the slit also comes up awfully high really a good option as a beach coverup i bought it as an actual dress and its a little too hard to stay decent in without some modifying,1
its very short waisted almost empire waisted even with the wrap belt it did not cover the waist seam will be returning,0
its super cute im a college student and its durable enough for my textbooks the straps are adjustable and ive gotten several compliments on it,2
material is very cheap i admit i didnt read the description and still havent but for it to be a swimsuit cover up it doesnt have the feel that i expected feels very silky i will be returning,0
90 of these socks inside are big huge strings that stretch out you cant put your foot in these socks your toes and toenails get stuck on them you cant keep your foot in the sock if it moves your toes get stuck on them chinese bad materials junk,0
the shoes were either too small or too big an inch difference we need for a wedding where her flower girl dress is ivory and these look yellowalso there are scuffs on both the pairs of shoes so they do not look like they are new not happy as i paid shipping 2x and now have to pay return shipping as well and still need to find her shoes for the wedding that is this weekend,0
they are soft and very comfortable chinese sizing is a lot smaller so be sure to get larger than what you normally wear i will buy more at this price,2
wish more came in a pack but love them,2
i bought this to be used during my daughters halloween party the girls were so excited the tattoos and glitter were just as described the body glue however was dried up and gummy we tried adding some drops of hot water to the glue which seemed to help a little but then it just went on kind of 34clumpy34 disappointed the girls gave up trying to work with it and i ended up throwing it away i dont feel this was amazons fault but rather it probably came that way from the manufacturer,0
great soxs,2
shoes are okay but are too narrow i had a similar pair of carhartt shoes in the past the same size as these are and they fit very well this is apparently a little different style then those were,1
i love this scarf light weight good length,2
left front pocket was not sewn properly did not notice until the first time i wore them and i tried to put my wallet and couldnt do so when i checked the pocket later it was obvious the pocket was defective,0
after seeing the negative reviews saying their packages arrived with dents i was a little scared to purchase this but it actually arrived in perfect condition the pins are very good quality too,2
i am typically a size 14 and i got these in an xl they absolutely did not fitbr br there isnt much stretch to em they have a slightly fishy scent and the fabric isnt comfortable at all you will absolutely sweat as it doesnt breath at all,0
the arms were too short and the shirt had no type of stretch to it im 54 125lbs and i got this in a small thought it would replicate the image shown a little off from the picture 610 still overall a cute top,1
material does not breathe shirts run small would not be able to dry in the drier also shipping took forever i am an amazon prime customer and took almost two weeks to arrive even thought it was listed as a prime item i would not recommend these shirts,0
cute earrings stamped out of acrylic and they are teeny tiny ones actually they should only be 200 per pair,1
it was smaller than i expected but i am in love with i especially the detail,1
to small and to short,0
great quality super cute great metal used as well,2
the design is a little dark,1
this is the first of many of pattys tops that doesnt fit as expected its very soft very stretchy im just going to exchange itbr does anyone know how resilient her rayonspandex shirts are to stains,1
this is a lightweight 34kimono34 that feels more like a swimsuit coverup its white and sheer and feels like something youd thrown on at an outdoor party in case it gets chilly if youre petite the length is quite long it seems made for a taller personbr br the quality is soso the 34crochet34 trim looks rather cheaply made and brings down the quality of the whole thing in fact i think it would have looked better without it if youre going to have a lace trim have it better madebr br overall its ok but i wouldnt pay the current price its being sold for on amazon,1
awesome hat,2
this is a quick beach coverup to put over your beach wear when you walk through the hotel lobby or when you run off to the snack shed the material is very light with just a few seams that seem quite fragile there is a lace border at the bottom that to me does not seem in character with the beach look again the chiffon material must be hand washed and hung dry which seems too fussy for rugged outdoor wear,1
tough finding size 10 w in a slide sandal that doesnt look hideous wanted a dressy shoe for my mom but this one will do and pretty much ticks most of her requirement boxes so far so good,2
good product its really worth the money,2
years ago i had a northface beenie that i really loved and that fit my head nicely so i was really hoping that this one would finally be the replacement ive been looking for this one was really think like three times thicker than the one i had lost it was a little too long and the seams were very prominent and hard to make it look good on me i tried it on my kids and partner as well but none of us looked nice in it kinda bummed so have to return this one and keep searching,0
hard to close granddaughter getting then for just bacause gift,1
nice shirt good material and handcrafted,2
just didnt like it on me,0
these are very comfortable shorts but the stitching is poor they started to fall apart very quickly,0
they are beautiful gloves however i was very disappointed to find they do not work in a touchscreen,1
nice quality and super soft however i ordered these thanksgiving weekend and we recieved them on valentines day the vendor responded quickly to my inquiries and returned the shipping fees these run really small,1
this is not true to size it was too small for me,1
i wasnt able to zip and coat comfortably,1
super sexy lexy boots,2
nothing to dislike,2
it is not 20mm by far it gets to 19mm and the edges ends rolling to the outside,0
i do like these ear rings they are made better i wish they were just a little bigger and thicker but for the price they will work,2
videoidab80494c179d240ee6e40e391db25156 not acrylic broke before i could wear them,0
its humongous its not just oversized its over oversized also it just looks cheap and the one i received had a scraggly place on it like it had been worn and returned i gave it to my dog as a blanket garbage,0
pretty short through the foot,1
they shrink a good full size upon washing the first time very disappointed,0
product fit as expected the fabric thinner than expected but will test next winter however mine arrived with the logo stamped at the top of the product likely right below check when worn disappointed but not huge deal and not worth the trouble replacing,1
they are cotton sox might be better if had a little lycra stretchy material in them,1
pinned to my black velvet top this brooch looks classy and beautiful,2
buckle broke the 3rd time i wore it very disappointed i want a refund,0
muy grande,0
the adult size 2xx is now a medium if you wash it more than three times give it to your elementary school er,0
i love it easy to assemble and just right for my boutique,2
so adorable,2
very nice but very cheaply madebr fell apart after 2 weeks,0
it nice but cheap first time in the washer it ripped never agian,0
just as lovely as pictured great fit,2
i was so excited to find a box like this my 6 year old son loves everything pirate especially captain jack i ordered this and some pirate coins to go in it for when hes playing pretend it seemed a little smaller than i was anticipating but for pirate coins it was just right the very first time we opened it one of the back plastic hinges snapped and so we cannot use the lid with it looks great not very sturdy quality,0
my teen wears athleisure clothing almost exclusively and these were right up his alley theyre comfortable and fit as expected as a parent i find they look a bit inexpensivethe fabric has a slight weird sheen to it and they do look like we got them at a local discount bigbox store but i have to admit they work well enough for a kid who isnt super picky i do appreciate that the pockets have zippers so he can stash things in them without worrying that it will fall out,1
i purchased 8 or 10 of wearme pro frames and on all the plastic is brittle and flimsy i kept buying them because it is impossible to find the styles anywhere else after i received my first pair i realized they were subject to breakage so i started ordering two pair of each style in case of breakage well withing one year one of the two frames i was using broke at the temple i have an excellent glue made in germany for repairs but even that did not workbr br i do not hold our much hope of the remainder of my frames lasting much longer than one year,1
the spring mechanism broke after a few months too bad as i really liked this belt,0
pretty but not any larger than my last normal size pair i have a really small face wear childrens hats etc and these just look like normal size glasses on me,1
i enjoyed this purchase,2
my niece loved them,2
this is a nice t shirt it is made is quality material,2
i couldnt find the same dickies shirt i bought a couple of years ago so i got this one its real nice but a bit snug i got it in large my previousshirt is large and is not so snug 57 175 lbs dad bod,2
they really feel fit and the help me at my job i walk and stay on my feet very long hoursbr the resistance to slip works great i tried on rainy days and on floors with oils and other liquids spills,2
it ripped as soon as my husband put it on his arm horrible quality,0
runs very small im an 11 and couldnt even get my foot in without crushing the toes,0
this shirt looks nothing like the photo it arrived and the cuts were literally made with a pair of scissors and were nothing like the photo,0
too big,0
i bought some of these previously from a nearby store and they quickly became my favorite undies the fabric is so soft on your skin and the fitting was perfect in the original sets i purchased there were no quitter elastic bands here these things are wonderful and stay on well and they dont become loose or misshapen from all the laundry cycles nor do they shrinkbr br well i just bought four packs off amazon excited to bring more of these soft undies into my collection and rotate old undies out except these are much smaller than the other ones i already own which is really strange you can see the printed information on the inside of the underwear same size and everything lines up then why do i feel like a blood sausage when wearing them side by side these new ones are considerably smallerbr br i am being squeezed by them so badly that my hips feel pinched and uncomfortable as the fabric shifts lower during wear constantly despite my tugging back up the front rides even lower on my abdomen and the thick waist band does not hold them up very well i am not sure why they changed their template and the amount of fabric they use for my size but they definitely changed something i would return them had i not washed them all and worn some if you buy them consider going a size up and make sure to try them on before washing in case they dont fit,1
so tightbr i couldnt wear it,0
too much wrinkling when washed,0
fair buy,1
this fits nicely but is a little baggy under the arms its a good length it falls to the middle of my calves its cotton to launders well,1
looks good but not as pictured,2
hard case and compact for my purse the cleaning cloth is great and it matches the case ill be able to recognize it if i misplace it i misplace everything ive not tried the tool yet,2
these are the best so cozy comfort cute the 3cs,2
ive been buying nb walking sneakers forever i went from the 577s to the 813s for the first time 7 months later the sole is separating i still have 2 old pairs of 577s i use for yard work and stuff and still havent had that problem when i sent a complaint email i got a return email with links on how to care for the shoes and how to prevent wear really ive probably been wearing sneakers longer than most people working there have been alive i will stick with nb but will go back to the 577s if i can still get them,0
very cheaply made hurts to wear has lining barely enough to cover your behind no zipper as pictured inseam under chestwhich is not pictured returning,0
if youre skinny with big boobs this will fit great unfortunately im chubby with big boobs so this is too tight around the abdomen and way too loose in the chest,0
scratchy material,0
expedition weight has been my goto for many years super warm as base layer under regular clothing on cold days or for outdoor sporting activities when ive hiked snowboarded gone ice fishing i wear under northface boarding pants and they keep me warm i get cold easily and these work wonders to keep me warm they also fit closr to the skin similar to a pair of leggings so they go well under dress slacks jeans even skinny stretch jeans ive warn them under and as base layer under several layers for outdoor sporting activities,2
love the socks but every time i order based on their size chart based on shoe size the socks are huge and im stuck with bunchy sloppy imtrippingoverthem socks,1
this dkny style comes in multiple colors and the red and black fit differently the red lace has less stretch which results in the cups of the red bra being eversoslightly larger and puckering on me,1
i got the white and once you put it on it looks exactly like a cheerleader skirt no thanks,0
stupid,0
these gloves arent durable dont waste your money,0
this did not flatter me my long torso made for a difficult fit,0
bought this for my step son and he loves it,2
no matter how good the value it isnt going to last my current trip i am down 3 of 6 flights with this new suitcase and its already tearing and damaged,0
videoid349f2f2f3dee9c768c107c06ec24438d,0
size is great easy to buckle sturdy,2
its ok my daughter liked it,1
the flare is too much for my ears,1
came late and hasnt lasted very long but the price was okay and it was a nice 34stocking stuffer34 had it come on time,1
dont buy this item,0
good style but cheap material,1
made me look like my grandma dont order,0
top has holes not even on both side someone took a hole puncher like you use with paper and the top has holes id send it back but its easier to keep without going through all thebr br top came with holes on both sides like a hole puncher was used on it id send it back but its to keep,0
it fits as expected but feels rough,1
it keep you warm will u doing any kind of exerciseit is kind of pricey but the quality is goodim 200 lb and i bought the l size at the firstand is too big for methen i return it for m sizei hope this can help u not getting the wrong size,2
i think i have a normal size head but these hung off my face and are super large in size recommend if you have a large head or like big glasses wide across eyes,0
doesnt look anything like the picture provided the letters are hard to read and it looks like a piece of paper glued in it no moon image was on the background either just plain white i would not purchase any charms for pandora bracelets unless they are sterling silver and tarnish resistant you got me this time though,0
i have a polyester allergy so i ordered these cotton nightgowns they are not instead according to the inked label they are 60 cotton and 40 polyester im sending the unopened packages back and requesting that the refund be credited to my accountbr br please advise your clothing and linen suppliers that there are a lot of people who need to wear and use cotton made items because they are allergic to polyester therefore if something is not 100 cotton please indicate that it is cotton polyester blend or whatever the cotton is blended with,0
too bulky,0
the bracelet is okay but it looks nothing like i got in the picture the chains are different style shains im a female and a and the bracelet was too big or my wrist so im wearing it as an arm bracelet beware when buying because youre not getting what is pictured,1
cute but break easily,1
great product,2
very nice quality thick and warm nice color,2
works perfectly cardsfit and easy to access id window is a plus not bulky at all i love it,2
did not fit gave it to my friend,1
very cute for date night it can be dressed up or down theres a button to close the top that i cut off but you might need it if busty because it tends to want to open if youre not careful maybe not the outfit for dancing but i didnt have a problem on a regular night,2
this bag was okay but ultimately not my style it was much smaller in person than it appears and was very orange and shiny i ended up giving to my mom and she loves it,0
the price of these are great they are super soft and lightweight they breathe but are not see through the pockets are deeper than what you get with most ladies shorts which is awesome the waist band keeps them super secure even after sweating and moving in them i bought them to play soccer in and they are a bomb purchase for the price plus there are no obnoxious labels or symbols or words on them so its a classy look,2
ordered a 78 for grandaughter was very large for a 78 and very tight fitting just ordered a 56 since my grandaughter insisted she wanted it i was not impressed with the quality or the price i would expect a nicer quality material and fit for 3000,1
i really like the shirt but it fits like an xs very pretty shirt and i like the feel of it i have to return it,1
adorable colors are very vibrant you wont be disappointed material is stretchy soft and very comfortable got a bunch of the jxstar leggings and dresses and the girls love them they get tons of compliments and their friends often want to wear them too recommended washing in cold water and hang drying so they last should fit for years thanks to the stretchiness,2
a see through fabric and was too wide would not recommend a poorly made product returns item i wouldnt want to keep it and wear in public,0
i love the color and look of these masks got 3 and they clean well comfortable too,2
bulky but guess they work,0
these may fit if i hope on to them in two or three years i was really shocked at the size they were like 5 inches to long i had ordered one size up so went to different company ordered the size and is 12 and perfect fit little roomy and perfect will be sending them back if i dont miss window i was just shocked how huge i should have read the comments my little one cried and cried they folded when she tried to walk in them it was like watching her walk in my shoes,0
such a cute sun dress but not true or even close to correct sizing im 54 175 lbs c cup and i needed a size small the dress is also very long just at the knee,1
order a size up i measured my chest did all the proper steps to establish the right size based on what they said to do and it was still too small so like i said order 1 size up from what you think it runs small,0
this worked great for a month and then the clip fell apart super bummed,0
the casing was wrapped professionally the reason i gave it three stars is because the watch comes to where if you have a small wrist you will need to find a jewelry place to take a link or two out of it because theres nothing that comes with it that you can use also the dial you use to adjust the time of the watch was tarnished as if it had been exposed to something or been left somewhere and faded other than that its a nice watch,1
are usually wear a large and this was a little too tight in the bust and im not a big busted at all had to return,0
i opted for the xxl because it is a comfortable fit but yet i can still fit in a liner when it gets colder,2
after one wash faded terribly looks like its be washed 20 times,0
my grandson loved them,2
watchband seemed quite well made and sturdy but it didnt fit my husbands casio gshock i mean we tried everything short of breaking out a hammer to fit that joker in the slot and it simply would not go,0
fits real nice very comfy im a usmc veteran with extremely bad feet not that socks in general make my feet feel better but i have noticed some improvement in comfort from rubbing etc wearing these socks i will most likely buy more if other colors become available have not worn them over an extended time frame to touch on durability but these seem to be reinforced in the right spots great intermediate sock all around,2
in general good quality and fabric is a bit stretchy too but the waist is very very tight id recommend ordering a size up for the size i bought i already did order a size up myself the waist should have been much wider and more comfortable also top part of dress is tight and hard to fit the blouse in so if you are very busty order 2 sizes up,1
cheap typical girls halloween costume the horns would not stay on my daughters head she said they were uncomfortable she is 6 the collar does not stay up like in the picture,1
the pant suit is big jacket is small the fit is so weird returning this hot mess,0
nice and thick but extremely tight on my head may loosen after several washes,1
i loved the shoe but way too wide and way too long,0
this necklace is beautiful the beads are well made and have the mottled look that is expected of turquoise it will compliment many outfits i had expected the beads to be a little bigger but its still great,2
fit is too large better problem than too small i suppose a medium comes down to my daughters knees and she is 19 yrs old,1
great,2
very cheap flimsy material,0
pretty but look feel cheap i would never want to give them as a gift,1
normally with sweaters i get a large so it doesnt shrink at all so i got a medium knowing that it is made to be oversized it was still gigantic,1
great fit and the shoes look nice fast delivery will purchase again,2
solid quality and looks great but i needed a 5 pin as advertised for a project but the pin is actually 76,1
these shorts fit me perfectly i love how they feel to the touch and how they feel on i also love how comfortable they are in addition they move with my body and fit like a good glove they also have two pocketsone on each side of the outer thigh i have no need for these pockets but it is a nice touch for those who can use thembr br i do have two issues with these shorts first the moment i opened the waist to put my feet through the legs all i heard was a ripping sound in the waist area as if the stitching in the waist was ripping apart however i cannot see any ill effect with the garmentbr br the other issue is that the look of the stitching in the butt area is weird i always wear shirts over my shorts so this stitching is hidden by my shirt however if i did not cover that area i would be embarrassed to wear these because there is an upside down double stitched smile which highlights the top of my butt and with the firmness of the shorts it makes it look like my posterior is being squeezed through that area of the shorts it is not very attractive and is the reason i rated this three starsbr br if these shorts did not have either problem they would have gotten five stars from me btw they look orange and not wine red so be aware of this before purchasingbr br this washes well in a machine but i hang dry it,1
ive tried many different fabric headbands from a variety of manufacturers so i think i have a pretty good idea of the range of whats available and how these things are made ive got to say that this one isnt all that great compared to some others the fabric doesnt have enough stretch to use for a headband this thick so if youve got a large head it will squeeze uncomfortably its also bulky comparatively speaking i think the problem isnt so much in the design as it is in the choice of material something thinner and stretchier is definitely neededbr i received a discount in exchange for an honest review,1
the back not as expected i expected a cross back like in pictures its just a rope still fits but i expected the cross back soft comfy materials,1
beautiful dress not too revealing with the right amount of sex appeal i received a lot of compliments,2
the picture above shows owl dangling earrings however i received studded owl earrings i really would have preferred to have gotten what i order however i still find them lovely and im going to keep them,1
cute socks wife loves it,2
convenient,2
i wanted to love this mask however its silky in the outside which makes it look and feel cheap great graphic tho,0
the lining on the shoes were already coming off after two days plus these shoes are very uncomfortable,0
ive only had it for a couple of weeks and the knot unravelled and it fell apart,0
okay too heavy,1
seemed like good pants but i couldnt fit into them way too tight around the waste,1
this was really really short i was hoping for something at least mid thigh but it didnt even cover the bottom of my suit i am send it back but would have loved it otherwise as it is nice and flowy and loose too bad,1
i ordered blue tint and received yellow tint i can return and but cant get the same 995 price stuck with yellow tint,0
not as advertised looks very cheap and is very difficult to put on i returned it,0
very cute,2
perfect,2
tie was okay had to be really dark to get the best detail out of it,1
ordered as a christmas gift,2
everything was perfect but i only got a 3 pack when i was supposed to get 5pack,1
the seams make it super hard to use for my purpose adding iron on vinyl beware,1
ok even good possible,1
the fabric has started to ball up my son loves them though says theyre super comfortable,1
storytime i began to take up running as a hobby i then injured a toe badly not from running and it drove me crazy if the top of my shoes rubbed against my toes i had already committed to running a race so i figured i would try to do it in sandals yes i did it in these yes i got a lot of weird looks yes i finished close but not quite at my goal timebr br i wear a size seven in most shoes except for athletic shoes for which i buy a size eight i did that for these and they fit well on my wide feetbr br the toe loop thing took some getting used to i wasnt sure it would be something i could live with but i needed the shoes so badly i decided to try them for a week and see if i could adjust it seemed stiff and intrusive well the material theyre made of doesnt seem like it would soften up but it does im really glad i gave them a shot theyre secure and yet very soft and bendable these shoes do not prevent my foot from doing anything that i want it to i have plantar fasciitis and that did not act up all summerbr br you can really feel the ground through them and yet they absorb shock well enoughbr br now to find a winter shoe thats this good,2
it felt like a costume and the seams were really tight so it didnt lay flat unflattering,0
sexy wife likes husband likes,2
i just adore this beanie its soft and warm,2
this tshirt is made of a soft fabric that feels good and is lightweight and comfortable the top i received looks exactly like the one pictured but i didnt take my photos with the shirt tucked in as in the listing photos it does look better if it is partially tucked in the front this shirt appears to be made well with all the seams being doublestitched overlock stitch and the fabrication looks like a standard jersey knit it has a nice amount of stretch and best of all it fits great it also has a side slit at the bottom of each side seam the label says to hand wash but i pretty much wash all my tops on cold delicate and hang them up immediately to dry this one included it washes on delicate finebr br i ordered a small and used a sewing tape to take the actual measurements of the garment with it lying on a flat surface in case the measurements might help with your purchasing decision for reference model is 56 112 lbsbr br chest 1825 365 46355 9271 cmbr length from high point shoulder 2575 6541 cmbr sleeve length 35 889 cmbr sleeve opening 9375 23812 cmbr armhole 10 20 254 508 cmbr neck opening 105 21 2667 5334 cmbr side slits 4625 1174 cmbr br overall this is a nice casual top that can be worn with almost anything tucked in or left out reasonably priced,2
very comfortable and easy to get on but they didnt come up high enough on my calf and so not comfortable in the long run sorry nurse mates you should to do better for nurses,1
these pants are super soft inside and have a nice look but they run way too small go about 23 sizes larger than you might normally wear after a couple washes they have some pilling on the fabric but the color did not fade at all,1
it was so cute,2
absolutely wanted to love this bag the leather seems to be on the brittle side first the purple and now the blue purse cracked handles at the gold hardware attachment point love every thing else about the purse but durability needs to be improved,1
didnt fit,1
the rings were severed it was just poor manufacturing it looked as if the rings would fall off very easily but it was cheap thats what you get when you buy cheap,0
poor quality very disappointing,0
great shirt but shrinks after the first wash,1
the cooling effect is noticeable and a welcome relief from the bermuda sun when i am cycling and playing golf the orange was not as vibrant as i wanted as it does not match my golf shirts or cycling kits but they do provide the protection i was expecting,1
i am 44 5 434 tall and 178lbs and am built pretty solidly and evenly i usually wear an lxl in ready to wear the xl fit perfectlybr br the design of the garment was good to hide flaws and accentuate the good things the stitching was excellent and i found no fault in the item received i even came back to see what other similiar items the seller company had to offer because i really liked this onebr br husband totally approved,2
i have tried and tried to develop a method for using this that works quickly with no struggle maybe i am just not coordinated enough but i lose my grip on the handle as i try to hold the clip on the bracelet ring and get the clasp open and in place at the right angle,1
a little bit to wide,1
love the watch its easy to put on looks great great price,2
love it,1
definitely a cheap product its very cute but i wore it for 20 minutes and the front charm popped off,1
it was me not the suiti just did not like the fit it made me fill to old,0
not adult sized at all,0
terrible quality silk ive ordered a different color of the same brand that was of much better quality this one had threads coming off before i even tied it for the first time,0
bought as a gift i went several sizes up so it would be big and luxurious nope this is definitely one plain size sleeves are short its tight in the shoulders definitely garbage,0
my 9 year old daughter found this herself and sent me the link it was exactly what she hoped for and fit her perfectly,2
my son loves these pants they look amazing and true to size the design is pretty cool too,2
i wear jeans w size 33 but this belt did not fit me even after i put it to the maximum length it might fit size 30 but for sure wont fit size 32 neither,0
these are ok tank tops but the quality of them isnt very good the strings are all starting to come out only after a few wears,1
well made and i love it,2
looks nice but it doesnt fit well size s 5434 170 lb,1
also the fabric is a nice soft blend that seems to resist wrinkles very happy with it,2
received item broken had to return it,0
my fiance really likes it,2
it was a little longer than stated,2
very thick on the small side overall not comfortable,0
i love this night dress on my daughter i bought it two sizes up and its not huge so itll last a while the quality is fantastic better than a more expensive one i bought that she outgrew,2
not terribly impressed will not purchase again does not feel like a running shoe,1
could have bought from chinese seller for third the price size is total bs terrible product,0
it s a great size my daughter took it to nationals last week she loves it but she used it for only a week and the inside fabric tore about 4 inches in the interior the fabric just sheared off i was hoping it would last the entire school year,1
size is an issue otherwise lovely product,2
its cute enough but very thin i wouldnt be comfortable wearing it without something under it it also had a small hole in it when i opened it,1
the pants are made from a pleasant soft material there is both an inside and an outside fastener which helps with the fit the fabric pattern is at least a departure from denim good for variety the pockets are a good size and the length and waist are spot on for a 170 lb 5105 framebr br but slim fit didnt seem to come through in this pattern the pants legs remained 24 in surplus around the knees and calves so that meant not dress as claimed but rather casual to our taste,1
cheap looking and far smaller that the size shown on the lable,0
light n compact,2
i loved them but they broke definitely not an everyday thing,2
seems cheap but does what i need also the inner fabric is gray not camo gray disappointing and not nearly as cute as i thought it would be,1
its just a costume and looks cheap,0
is not the size that it says,0
i have a few bras of the same name brand that fit beautifully this particular style with the insert did not fit i would not recommend them to anyone,0
videoidb8bc3970b71e052340669ae525338942 i absolutely adore these sunglasses it is chic and super stylish it is very modern and hip it goes to my everyday outfits to top it off i did get tons of positive compliments from my friends family coworkers and random strangers i know it is colorful but i think that these sunglasses are unisex it is not feminine at all it may have this reflective effect on it but it will just add some drama to your outfitbr when i got these sunglasses it was neatly wrapped it comes with a small sunglass pouch the poach is soft and can be used to wipe the sunglasses the seller did an awesome job in shipping these sunglasses,2
this turned my arm green within a couple hours of wearing it i understand its inexpensive but its not even good for one wear i had bought it because i misplaced my real pandora so was hoping to wear this one until i found my real one,0
just too tight returned them tried a larger size and they just dont work for me,0
shoes are too heavy but i will give them a chance,1
this coat feels so lightweight but is very warm,2
beautiful color terrible quality,0
i have purchased several of these i really like the way they flow and they wash nice,2
looks exactly like the picture but runs extremely small i actually went a size up and got an extra large instead of a large that i would normally wear and it was small the material does feel very soft to the touch and it feels as if its breathable keep in mind since it does run small if youre a thicker woman youre going to have to go as large as you can possibly get,1
these earrings are cute but the opening for the ear to fit through was way too small it was only 12 centimeter i was able to fit my ear through but it was a tight squeeze and very uncomfortable,0
this product worth not more than 12 for its quality its priced doubled and not that much great product,0
very nice bra and made well but the band is a little snug so when i buy a new one i will go one size up in the band,2
shoe is very na8,1
i had high hopes for these 30 slipper socks however the opening is very narrow for me and it is hard to get them over my heels i bought the 3 pack of mens because i thought i could share them with my husband but he cant even get them on either i was afraid that the womens would be too smalltight i wear a womens 10 and i like my socks on the loose size i prefer not to have to fight with my slippers every night i am disappointed i love the sherpa and the slip resist but neither do any good if i cant actually wear them,0
this is the 2nd one ive purchased in a different pattern cute and lightweight for the beach,2
broke the first time i wore them while i was walking from my front door to my car not good quality,0
i love this i wear the hell out of it,2
these keep my hands somewhat warm without being too bulky so that i can still move them but the elastic around the wrists isnt tight enough i wouldnt wear them for prolonged cold weather exposure but running errands in the car they hold up alright or for early springlate fall use is ok,1
these are surprisingly highquality looking for the price also my arms are really skinny and when tightened all the way they fit perfectly i could see these fitting a range of arm sizes well the laces are really long granted i had them cinched as tight as possible so i had to tuck them up into the wrist band itself but they could easily be cut and wouldnt fray they went about half way up my arm so not quite long enough to truly guard my arm if i were to actually use them for archery unless i scooted them up away from my wrist but these were for a costume so they worked great,2
i love the style the nosepiece and earpiece are very comfortable and sit nicely on my face the case is very nice too they claim to be scratch resistant but they scratch just as easily as any other sunglasses i scratched mine the first time i dropped them and the lens popped out also the polarization makes the inside of the lens blue which is kind of weird,2
this dress was poorly made and the material was extremely cheap i paid 4999 1999 for shipping and handling 544 in taxes 400 promotion 7144 total to return it i paid 1273 i was refunded 4978 i ended up wasting 3439 on a product i 1 did not like at all as its not like the picture 2 did not wear at all because i didnt even bother trying it on 3 do not ownbr br i would say yourself the trouble and dont order this,0
okay if there is a shirt perfect for a beach date this would it if fit my husband perfectly and the green color is really nice,2
i guess because its not the traditional suede you get with uggs it fits really tight my husband wears an 11 in every shoe including traditional uggs these were so tight he couldnt even get them on very stylish and great quality just not your average sizing,1
didnt fit as expected,1
as i said the chain is perfect and shiny the spring ring is another story it is small but the connector is terrible in the picture itbr shows a flat link the goes into the spring ring my necklace didnt have one so it connects right into a ring it barely fits in and is very hard to get ini tried several times to put it on and got frustrated this morning i got it oni may have to leave it on for a couple ofbr daysnever know when i will be able to get it on again i may look for a connector link and that should make it betterbr this could have just been a fluke but i dont honestly know if i will but from them again whic is sad because it is a nice piece,1
this garment did not appear as it does in the photos i normally wear size m the shoulders and sleeves fit well but the bodice hangs too closely and the length could be longer it does not drape as nicely as it shows in the photos the material used is polyester even the crocheted parts i do not like the feel of polyester because it doesnt breathe the garment had a questionable odor perhaps it was offgassing due to the synthetic materials i couldnt return it fast enough,0
too large,1
this hoodie definitely keeps me warm ive had it for over 2 years but ive only worn it a few times it holds up well in the washer but i do wash it on the hand wash cycle on cold i dried it the 1st time regretted it it definitely shrunk i purchased several other hoodies just like this that never shrink i would wear it more but its not my favorite because falls short at my waist wasnt that way when i initially tried it on the hood itself didnt cover my head from the beginning im 56 160lbs got a large all my other hoodies like this are large fit nothing like this the one thing i dont like is the length of the sleeves i dont have long arms but the sleeves end short at my wrist id say from my personal experience size up definitely dont dry it hang it to dry its a bummer because it is so warm this season as i bring out my winter clothing it will be time for me to probably donate this one to the goodwill i own several others i wear this one takes up space i would have returned way back when i purchased this but i had already washed it threw out the bag it was in my 2 star reflects the warm the nice color pattern otherwise i wasnt happy with this purchase i would have never thought to order an extra large most of my weight is below my waist i personally dont recommend,0
replaced the chain because it was flimsy,1
didnt fit so sent back without issue,2
cracked at the top of the frame after leaving them in my car from the heat,0
pretty good boots they do fit on the tight size should have gotten a half size bigger but maybe they will stretch so far zipper seems good makes taking them on and off very easy these boots are very light and soles are super quiet and grippy one thing to note because they are waterproof they dont breathe and can get pretty warm on the flip side they are nice and warm on my bike even in 40s,2
too high difficult to make smaller,0
material not as expected,0
love the arch support in these saddles and how great they look,2
i ordered a large which i usually get im a mediumlarge it ran super small on my sister whose a large and small on my mom whos a medium go up two sizes for a proper fit how disappointing its cute just unwearable,0
broken out of the box fixed it with some super glue and it was good to go,1
beautiful eyecatching silver earrings only four stars because they frequently slip out of my ears ive taken to using extra backings from other earrings to ensure they stay in place but they are fine attractive lightweight and leaf looks just like a real one,2
as a 21 yr old male the bandana is a little bit small its a good deal for the price though,1
was really great until the whole right sleeve unraveled after only wearing it for an hour or 2,0
the strips are short for adults,0
super cute tts,2
hi there i know its me aging the customerbr positive really fast shipping didnt pay forbr but it came with a cost an its a big one yes i know there a cute badge but i ordered them expected too be a 100 percent on point i need them for my wedding this week coming up an for our photographer so in all you get what you pay forbr br ps be handy with the glue gun,0
runs very smaller than description,0
i wanted something smaller for my travel pack the cards for snug maybe too snug because its difficult taking things out and the side and middle compartments are suuuper tight,1
lower end asics show but good for the money,1
absolutely the worst purchase of my life theres no hem and where the shoulder was stitched together all the excess thread is hanging they rough cut the entire bottom of dress into a high low cut and left it absolutely horrible,0
not enough support,2
its more like a windbreaker rain jacket so its not heavy,2
save your money on this one this is a case of 34you get what you pay for34 cheaply made and cheap looking,0
size is an issue,0
this looks like a fuzzy rug nothing like the picture,0
very cheap quality came with permanent creases in the material and it took two weeks to show upbr br absolutely love the royal blue color just wish the tie didnt suck,0
comfortable and nice enough for an office job,2
way too small returning,0
disappointed with packaging when amazon said they would put it in amazon packaging i did not imagine a ziplock bag when i put the shoe on it looked obzocky this is a caribbean slang which means awkward unattractive misshapen my shoe size is us 85 however this shoe was bigger than my fit and because of that it looked misshapen i cannot return it because shipping from the caribbean would be horrendous i will not recommend this as an attractive shoe good enough to run errands or use in the garden,0
i absolutely love these pants i recently lost weight and am in need of new clothes i saw these and read the reviews and decided to take the risk and get the size 4 crossing my fingers they got delivered a bit late due to bad weather but i received notifications the whole time and i was kept up to date when i took them out of the bag and saw that they looked small i was really disappointed i thought for sure they wouldnt even go above my hips however to my surprise not only did they go beyond my hips but they buttoned up nicely the fabric is very comfortable and stretchy i didnt even have to shorten them i am very happy with this purchase,2
when i got these slippers about 4 months ago they looked pretty nice and fit okay although a little wide and sloppy to walk much in the big problem is that they have separated at the seams with minimal wear i feel cheated and will never waste money on this product again,0
looks cheap n fits tight around wrist7 in not too much wiggle room,1
i bought the small for my 11 year old it fits her with room to grow,2
after three years and three months the second hand fell off it looks great it would have to be turned back two minutes every week it needs to be worn every day or it dies,0
love this style and color,2
gave them as gifts,1
i was a little disappointed in the lace both pairs had snags in two different places that i had to repair in order for the laces to be usable i hope that the laces hold up better then the condition that they arrived in,1
dont hesitate this robe is so comfy and warm buy it,2
very cheaply made i have another alex and ani bracelet that was made of a silver metal band super sturdy and feels good on the wrist this one is thin too flexible and really flimsy,0
i bought this magnetic band because a friend had one and really enjoyed theirs i got this installed after almost losing one of the pins used to hold this onto the watch the band was good for about a week when it just started to randomly catch on stuff it was a few days later that i noticed one of the ringlets was broken and pulled out so it would catch on stuffbr br i am also tired of having to readjust the band 67 times in a day because the magnet is too weak to keep it in place i removed it from my watch but will keep it as a backup for the just in case so as the title says not bad just not good either i dont regret buying it just might not buy it again,1
just dont buy it the metal is not silver and turns copper colored in 2 months,0
havent opened package yet just the outer amazon package as its a gift ill update later i am still choking over the heavily perfumed dryer sheet kind of smell that came out of that bag omg,0
good for a purse drape,1
these are not compression shirts they do ride up the only thing i can say is at lest they did not roll up,0
this necklace is gorgeous but only lasted a couple months,1
really cute and fits well except in the chest i got my normal size but this thing crushes my chest and doesnt have much support no other bathing suits do either but this is a bit uncomfortable,2
comfortable causal dress made out of thin material that seems to wrinkle easily looks super cute and is longer then expected but thats probably just because im short perfect for this up coming cruise season,1
se ve mejor en la imagen,1
ni siquiera recibí el reloj,0
first of all it comes in two pieces i ordered the large you get a small tank top then the lace over garment i should have ordered a xl im 511 170 lbs the large is pretty small on meits a cute lace but eh,0
if you love dogs this is for you,2
perfect with leggings pretty and comfie,2
got these and first set has 2 holes in tge seem hopefully the exchange is better,0
not true to size i can barely tuck it in and i bought to wear under my work shirts,0
okay for driving,2
i was let down by this order they didnt fit well and seemed to be really flimsy the material and the fit made for a bad combination i would not recommend i returned mine,0
how do you gr8 this on the clasp is wobbly and taut i will literally need someone else to help me put it on,1
line does not disappear with heat as suggest by supplierruins appearance of a crisp white sneaker will try to return,0
the amazon photograph of the dress showed border material on the sleeves and bodice the cut of the fabric is inconsistent in the product i received and renders the dress unattractive also the fabric design is not as crisp the white is dull a bit on the greyyellowed side as if it had been washed before being sent to me it came without a product tag will return,0
these are great for spinning class comfortable and a nice smooth fit,2
loved this set it worked perfectly for my trip i was able to divide my stuff my daughters our swimwear our toiletries and shoes all in my luggage easily it all fit perfectly and there was no digging around in my bag to find something because so had everything i need,2
the product arrived extremely late and they were a little bigger than expected but the quality of the product is great very pretty and sparkly,1
daddy got this for my granddaughter for christmas and she looks like a doll baby in it,2
i always wear a size 7 which is what these shoes are they run very small as my big toe comes right up to the tip with no wiggle room and this is without socks that is the main reason that i cannot wear thembr br also because of the size i cannot put my orthotics in them and without the orthotics they have very poor arch support,0
its ok rusts quickly,1
cute but cheep you get what you pay for,0
they fall down,0
these are my favourite pair of slides i would for sure recommend these,2
absolutley love the fit and price when i first bought i bought two pairs and between the 2 wore them at least 4 days a week so after a year inner fabric is worn i have curvy thights so they do touch knees also baggy after a year im 5 and 140 lb bought both size 8 and 10 10 was too loose 8 fit great pictures are after almost a year of washing and wearing,1
very warm vest but runs rather small also the left hand pocket seam is coming out after 2 days otherwise seems to be good quality,1
love it,2
im going to make this simple dont waste your money disposable material too small for a regular sized woman,0
super cute dress fits well and looks good on nice material and well made im 59 tall and on the fluffy side and this dress fit me perfectly,2
great hot to take to work it fits good but it bends a little to easy,2
not sure what i was expecting but these are okay just okay maybe give as a gift to young niece,1
rip off and a piece of junkbr the picture is of another itembr its cheap awful and bait and switch,0
kind of a waste after putting it on once it will never be worn,0
do not buy a waste of money cheap watch the black coating fades fast came with a scratch already easily damage not high quality look will return asap cheap china made watch the picture looks nice then the watch,0
very cute and comfy only issue is if you have any chest at all it looks like youve shoved it all in should be more room in there,1
light weight material,0
description stated these pajamas were 100 cotton they werent did not look at the tag closely until it was too late had already removed all the tags before i realized the fabric is 60 cotton 40 rayon,1
i returned this because i ordered much bigger than normal and its very tight across the chest its also a very thin material i was expecting thicker and higher quality,0
received as a present they fit great and are comfortable,2
this is very soft and roomy i love it its lightweight so do not order if you are expecting a sweatshirt weight garment i ordered down a size after reading other reviews and am happy i did one thing to note the side slits go up very high i actually sewed about 65 inches up on both sides to get them to where i prefer them im not kidding i measured the slits and sewed 65 inches on each side not total this didnt discourage me i just got creative and fixed it,2
cheap quality and didnt look good i donated it,0
cheaply made,1
this charm was a great addition to my bracelet just enough sparkle to bring attention to it,2
my son loved his gift he teared up when i gave it to him for his bday,2
very nice purse my wife likes it a lot amazon had a great value,2
it was super comfortable but i wouldnt wear it as a dress maybe a coverup,2
it was too big could have went down a size and i didnt like was how wide the top was too much space,0
its ok,1
to thin and light weight,1
it fits well but the buckle is huge and it has nickelsmartcom all over it so if youre looking for a plain black nickel free belt this is not it,1
this product runs very small and is unable to return since you have to mail back to china and way too expensive to send back save your money,0
replaced all my switchgear wheels installation is one hour it is not very smoothly move wo any load but fine,1
it is nice quality,1
shoe fits well but the insole is not as padded as older hush puppies had been,1
i ordered a 2x according to the chart its cut more like a us mediumbr not certain the 4x would even fitbr shipping took foreverbr highly disappointed,0
mechanically they seem fine they fit my glasses just as i expected them tobr br they are advertised as 34polarized34 this means they should reduce reflected glare from all horizontal surfacesbr a simple lensrotation test showed they dont reduce glare from any angle they are not polarizedbr br i returned them,0
a little tight and took a bit for the leather to stretch to fit my hands but did great for my cosplay,1
obsessed with this sweater the high neck allows me to layer on cold days and its light enough to wear without layers one warmer days im in the coldest part of wisconsin and have worn these all winter i do have it multiple colors,2
my kingdom for clothes cut for big n tall denizens of the usasize does matter contrary to popular belief,1
way to small what do they measure in child sizesbr to bad because they were so cute,1
the material was nice and it is lined color was very nice too and the style would have worked if it wasnt forbr br the elastic waist is right under the boobs not comfortable the dress torso is way too short i am very average my height is almost 56 with longer legs and shorter torso but the dress torso is 23 inches shorter than my natural waistline it probably would work for pregnant women or ladies 52 and shorterbr buttons dont work very well either very hard to button up both the front and the sleeves ive returned it,0
i didnt get the color i asked for i ended up with a red outfit but ill keep it my size obviously didnt coordinate with the size chart provided but its cute the fabric is nice and soft its a goal outfit at this point iv recently lost 22 lbs so ill keep working to get into this cute get up,1
i highly recommend these for people who wear a size 8 or smaller im an 8 12 and they are a tad small,1
i cannot get the wallet to fold over completely with what i carry so it is fat and difficult to get out of my pants pockets for someone who doesnt carry much in a wallet it would be fine however with 2 credit cards health club metro medical ids and a few cards plus some bills there is too much for the size of the wallet,1
very cheap waste of money the balls fall right off the ends of the earrings they should be ashamed for selling this crap,0
i gave this gift to a buddy for his college graduation he loved it and received many compliments on it without being prompted it comes across as very unique now im going to get one for myself the wood grain was almost identical to the picture as well,2
this hits way too short and i have a short torso it shows it coming a lot longer on the model,1
this is a nice fitting dress and it looks nice but the material is very light i can see through it i gave it 4 stars because of the material but the fabric is veryyy soft and comfortable hugs my body in all the right places,2
too tall and too wide at the top,1
they are just ok tho over and bigger loop than i expected but good quality,1
there is a rubber thing on the ends of the wrap around part that falls off and wont stay on and they just fit like crap but they are just cheap glasses,0
this bathing suit fits just as expected i like it all much i took it on vacation received many compliments,1
looks nothing like the pictures fit is so bad very loose and way longer than pictures quality sucks,0
i absolutely love these sunglasses i have several pairs of grey jack sunglasses but this is my favorite pair yet light frame design makes them so comfortable and no pressure on my nose quality product i especially like the colored lenses very satisfied with the product and the packaging great gift idea too,2
fit is ok looks nice on the buttons make it look cheap the button loops are white elastic on the dark red it looks cheap they should match the shirt plus there is a gap so i will have to wear something under itbr i might spend the time to remove and put matching loops on it who wants to have to fix new clothes,1
i like this necklace it is nice but it has a funny metal smell to it that i really dont like and when my man wants to kiss on me why would he want to smell dirty yucky metal nice necklace but dont like the smell,1
my grandsons will love the christmas gift,2
the watch was a little too manly for me i have a small wrist so this was a little overwhelming and not very feminine,1
great dress but if your hippy its gonna ride up in the back i loved it but my rear would be showing even though i went up a size,1
bought a 3xl and it was the size of a large the company would take a return,0
i love these pants they are classy and comfy fit perfectly and seem well made i am 54 105 lbs and ordered size xs,2
i love the bright colors and durable material,2
i bought 2 dresses blue and red xl bc thats what i normally wear but its a tiny bit big on me but not enough to returnbr i love the dress i have received many compliments on both dressesbr im thinking about a 3rd color but this time i may buy a large to see if it fits,2
this chain will not lay flat i have tried everything i can think of to get it straight with no luck the chain is nice and heavy which was what i wanted but all things considered i wish i had it to do over,1
pretty good quality not to thin they are not wrinkle free but the good cotton ones are supposed to wrinkle learn to love the wrinkle,2
nice socks i love the colors but they are a little shorter than most crew socks i have owned,1
do not waste your money this set is cute and comfy however after two wears i havent even washed the top it is completely covered in pills and looks old and worn out for over 200 that is unacceptable and disappointing,0
quality seemed ok but ran small and narrow returned them,1
nice watch nice size not too big and not too small looks simple and classy at a quick glance but upon closer look the row of numbers on the inside rim and the roman numerals give it a bit more style and charm,2
four year old son loves it vibrant colors good material sewed together well have had no issues,2
gave this to a 12yr old girl who loves gymnastics she really liked it would recommend,2
total junk wore a few times and the side split,0
certainly great shoes just meant for really narrow feet,1
this is not a bra for larger breasts honestly i cant imagine its any better for any size breasts my shoulders killed me after driving for 6 hours i did nothing but drive nothing that should have made the bra kill my neck and shoulders but kill them it did this thing made me feel like i had a flipping injury please do not waste your money,0
the waist is super high and tight the length is barely what it saysim sending mine backthe hips are ok not too loose or tight the main problem was the waist length,1
a light weight material fit as expected and has not shrunk after many washes,2
im plus size with lumps and bumps this is not for a women will curves that dont want to be super noticeable i wish it came in a larger size runs small,1
i had to return them they are way bigger than i expected,1
i love wearing maxi dresses and skirts but the one thing i could not get over was how the seams never matched up with any of the designs it is kind of cheaply made for the top part of the material and shows the edges of my bra too much i am 585 133 lbs and ordered a medium some of the dresses go to my feet and some were around the ankle bone the length of these dresses are very inconsistent,0
this is lightweight so much that nothing is hemmed and every side of it has thread coming out which i dont see stopping unless i sew it its large enough to tie attractively but i dont expect this scarf to last very long,0
dont waste your this is horrible quality i cant believe i paid that amount for a damn 5 dollar tshirt,0
fits great and is very comfy i ended up buying a second dress in black,2
pretty style but it runs very small,0
terrible arch structure,0
the watch itself is quite pretty however the white is a rubber material that attracts dirt like ants to sugar it came out of the box dirty it came out of box looking like a return with plastic protective band cover loose n dirty it did let me see real quick the ease of it getting dirty i never even got to wear it if it had been white ceramic i woulda been loving it still but functionality is a must,1
bit long,2
excellent product exactly what i was looking for very well finished and just what i expected very good quality highly recommended,2
i was hoping these would be a replacement for the fly by capris that i love those fit perfectly and have pockets big enough for a large phone the fly fast capris are neither of those things they feel a bit off cut smaller than other ua capris and the pocket is too small for a phone the sole reason i bought these was to be able to hold my phone so im extra disappointed ill probably just give them away since its too much of a hassle to return them,1
amazon graciously replaced the first shirtsame shirtsame issue not sure why the collar is so disfigured but this second shirt has never been put onsono i did not stretch it putting it on obviously theres an issue with the materials they used in the collar,0
these things are like barbed wire on the ears the straps are so thin and fragilelooking and when the mask is on they bunch up and really pull on the base of my ears its a constant occasionally sharp stinging sensation i will be returning these and looking for something less painful,0
excellent fit for a big man,2
the ring on top was crooked and it looks totally like you got it from a gumball machine,0
the one size fits all didnt fit too much strap too few holes didnt know what to do with the extra leather it was too long and the holes were too close so did not match up nice product couldnt use it,0
better price than landsendcom supima cotton is so soft snd comfy love it,2
i actually love this swimsuit it is a cute design im 57 125 d cup and ordered a medium the top is super adjustable to fit different chest sizes 4 stars because the stitching was a uneven,2
whos ears are this big these are horrible too big to be used what they are advertised as well they were cheap so no love lost,0
perfect size and color,2
these are cute and will complete a look or an outfit but they are not shoes you want to wear all day i would wear these to a dinner or event that doesnt last several hours if you are not walking a bunch these are great for the aesthetics,1
i like this i wear it when i do exercise,2
when i opened these there was a hole in 2 separate pairs of underwear was disappointed with the fact that i bought brand new or atleast supposedly brand new underwear to have holes in the butt on two of them also i was expecting to get all blue or blueblackgrey but 2 of the pairs were red so this should say packaged items may not come as advertised or something along those lines,1
material is stretchy fits like a glove,2
so for something that was made in china the quality is ok the fabric isnt as bad as other clothing items they come out with its very stretchy which is the only reason it fits as well as it does i am a size 1618 and ordered a size 2xx its snug enough to where the pleats in the front and back are stretched out and look weird but aside from that its a flattering dress you cant machine wash it because its so poorly made the threading was already coming apart when i opened the package normally i would have sent this back but for a product made in china this quality is to be expected it cost a little more than most clothing items made in china because the quality of the fabric is a little better this still looks kind of costumey but since its a retro dress that kind of works i ordered this as a costume piece for a dance performance but it looks ok enough to wear to the office too,1
its a cute shirt and well made and good material the strap in the front is a little awkwardit just kind of lays theremaybe if it were a bit tighterits not bad but could be better i dont know if sizing down would helpim in between small and medium and went medium which feels right in most areas except the band strap in front thingie,2
adorable and fluffy very well made i get positive comments on it all the time,2
for reference my son is on the light side shy of 60 lbs at around 53 to 54 inches tall we got the 810 and it fits perfectly with how fast kids grow if you opt for the perfect fit it probably wont last more than a year anyway he looks will good in it and he likes how he doesnt have to deal with belts 5stars,2
fit my fishing glasses great,1
nothing sluggish about my sloggers,2
these ran a lot bigger than i expected,1
lovely jeans but you need to be taller than 5ft 3 bought for trip to spain needed to take 4 inches from bottom which would take flare away,0
i am a bigger lady so finding a suit to fit is not easy this fit great and i feel confident in it i wondered at first if the pattern looked like a nighgown but i have gotten lots of compliments around the pool the fabric is a bit on the light side kind of flimsy but that just makes it hang nicely fantastic price,2
it is a comfortable material but kind of tight around the face,2
me gusto mucho encajo en mi cuerpo perfectamente,2
absolutlhy no support,0
upon opening it has a terrible smell like a chemical its been washed several times and still stinks,0
i bought this dress for my daughter and it fits okay but would have liked it to fit better kinda short and little snug but shes able to wear it,0
my wife loved these nice quality would order again seems like good quality fast shipping and good price got both colors,2
im always looking for a great bra and this one is spectacular not only is it pretty and just sexy enough to keep my man interested but it also offers loads of support and is super soft i wear this one when i wear anything dark and it blends together nicely i love that this bra doesnt poke me either hate an underwire bra that jabs you in the ribs all day long this one just holds the girls in place without suffocating them and the fabric is thick enough that my headlights dont shine through on a cold day no one needs any of that happening especially when you wear this to work all in all i highly recommend this pretty little bra,2
the stainless steel looks very cheap although the stones are pretty but dont think i would wear them for anything dressy,0
i did not like the fabric it feels and acts more like spandex,0
this tank top is huge i am short but not small i normally would get a large but ordered a medium based on reviews it was enormous so i exchanged it for a small it was still too big i think the cut was intended to have the fabric drape but the material was a little too thick to properly drape it just tented out in the least flattering way,0
the heart part was nice and heavy but the chain was light weight we took the chain off and just used the rings,1
i was going to wear them on an upcoming cruise when i went to my drawer to collect them to pack them one were already broken,0
these boots were so cute in person i was so excites to get them and then to my utter dissappointment they didnt fit i wear a size 75 in everything when i put these on my toes touched all the way to the front i was barefoot also so there would have been no room for socks the boots themselves were beautiful and did look way expensive i had to send them backand there was no option for exchange for another size so that was pretty dissappointing also i would have exchanges for an 8 too bad getting my money back,0
purchasing for myself very cute shoe however the sizing is way off tried to give them to my daughter and she could not fit them either purchase at least one to 2 sizes up,1
i can feel all my toes when i wear these,2
i love using these the stirrup design doesnt pull on your leg or socks making it very comfortable to use definitely a great but for the price,2
i love bzees shoes but these werent for me although they were billed as wide width they were uncomfortably narrower than the regular width bzees i own on top of that i walked out of them despite getting the size i usually wear its as though the wide size was extended in length but not in width i returned them which was a pain because they didnt come with free return shipping im giving them 2 stars because in general i think bzees are great shoes with good arch support,0
for the sizes listed of small medium and large it would be better to put an actual size of what the small medium and large really are also i thought id get a pack of 4 different bright colors black and grey arent bright,0
i love gerber clothes they fit great and hold up good,2
great design great gift for my uncle,2
its actually really good quality i like that the text is actually embroidered on the back the material seems sturdy and it fits really well my favorite hat i think,2
i returned it for a smaller size otherwise he loved he shirt the pocket was a big deal for him,1
this is cute but is scratched and looks used,0
i bought this sweater for my elderly grandfather this sweater fit him perfectly and the sweater is a perfect thickness it is not thin feeling,2
this hat was much much smaller than i thought it would be i bought it for my husband but it barely fit me i would only recommend it for a child,0
cheap cheap cheap do not waste your money purchased 2 and 1 arrived damaged after a few weeks chain broke poor quality and poor customer service,0
what a shame to hand knit with such inferior yarnthe knitting was fine but i doubt the material will last a winter,1
the arms are weird and it is uncomfortable,0
i have ordered 5 because they are comfortable and im always receiving compliments,2
it helps with glare of on coming lights,1
product is well made only complaint is you can barely see the pink color i will say their customer service is phenomenal this is the 3rd charm ive bought from them and the craftsmanship has always been great,2
the fit is a bit strange feeling they stretch but not much just not super comfy like i expected,1
does not fit as expected very thin material too low ankle length,0
to big and had a smell to it,0
a nice looking vest just a wee bit snug and material is pretty stiff i am hoping with some washing that it will soften up a bit but looks nice ill keep it but really wish it wasnt so snug in the hips,0
flimsy,1
te agradezco,2
a little to tight for bracelet taking on and off to had charms,1
nice but too tight for my big head one size does not fit all,0
my son just started wearing size 8so i bought the 78 but those were too small had to move up a size to 910,1
all my other shoes are 10½ but i had to send these 10½s back for an 11 which fit perfectly otherwise the shoes are awesome ive walked over 10 miles a day three days in a row and my feet felt great at the end of each day they are undoubtedly the most comfortable walking shoes i have ever worn,2
ok,1
i bought 3 differnt chains before i settled on this one its perfect for my pendent it shines and glitters and has a great lobster claw clasp great color too very happy with this purchase price was right too buy one,2
i think that my eyesight is normal no glasses for reading or even distance but i couldnt read the watch the buttons and letters etc are very small maybe if you have a magnifying glass and tiny fingers it would be a good deal,0
this came bent in a couple of areas where the belt had permanent wrinkles from ans knowing its 100 pu you can definitely smell it the hardware is very sturdy but also had some rough cuts ready for an injury ultimately im returning because its much too large i am 110lbs 5 and wear a size 0 jean and the small was for a 34medium34 this belt is fine if you can deal with the smell too,1
arrived on time nicely packaged and appears to be very good quality for the price i like the leather braided belts because my waste size goes up and down dieting not dieting lol and they offer more flexibility in buckling with many more hole locations than a standard belt with punched holes i have spent allot more on braided leather belts that have fallen apart quickly with everyday use the belts with a flat leather core like this one last much longer as opposed to the belts that are only braided with no core,2
its just okay its a dress made of cheap fabric and the seams are uneven i think its overpriced for what it is,1
perfect,2
its okkay but doesnt fit me,1
exactly as pictured and exactly what i needed for a golf tournament,2
screwing the pieces together the thin plastic cracked lengthwise and i could no longer use it,1
did not like for me wanted something to keep the old bones very warm as i tend to be chilly in the winter even when inside the house however hasten to say in the warmer weather for a young lady out on the town it will be an attractive addition to her wardrobe,1
i ordered a xl shipping was quick but when i opened the item it was labeled as a us leur largeasian xl i am returning it and the ordering a xxl hopefully that will be a us xleur xlasian xxl i will rate it again and update this when the new one is receivedbr update the new one came as a us xleur xlasian xxl so order a size larger for us buyers,1
too fake looking,1
nice hoodie husband loves it sift and cozy im just a little perturbed that the tag showed a lower price than what i paid,2
band started cracking after only 2 weeks very sad because i liked the look of this band,0
loved it,2
excellent product and good service,2
i am very happy with the color of these earrings and they are the perfect size they are well made and came very quickly i am looking forward to wearing them often,2
wow impressivegood qualitysleeves banded wont stretch out came in a beautifulblack box this company sets out to give youbaxquality product i am ordering another pair hope they carry for women too,2
1010 the color and fit are perfect highly recommend,2
jerzees are a little more fitted than i like but the product looks sturdy is lightweight and washes well,1
they dont fit like the black pair i ordered with the same company they fit more like tight leggins instead of yoga pants,1
i love it i get so many compliments on it men think its sexy and women wish they had their belly pierced,2
gave to my son for christmas size is as advertised he really likes these shirts they seem heavy to me but he likes them because he can wear them during really hot days,2
very nice purse and has what i like in a purse nice quality great size and plenty of compartments great value for the money,2
this isnt a 65 its a 6 it says so on the box with that being said its way too small,0
this sweater is just a little too fuzzy it has an angora like yarn that makes it super hairy the print doesnt stay nice and crisp looking because of all the fur,1
this hoodie fits perfectly has a nicesliding zipper and is very comfortable to wear ample enough for a sweater underneath it provides a perfect degree of warmth for fall the trim is white and the zipper matches nice style looks good with jeans and leggings good fabric combo of cotton and polyester,2
for this particular product the type of material used in the manufacture and creation of the product seems to be of very good quality one must consider that for any product of this type there is a balance between the type of material used and the cost that is to be passed on to the consumer i think for this product that balance has been met fairly well and i believe that the product will meet the expectations of most buyersbr br with regard to the fit and finish of this particular product i believe it to be about average for the products of similar make or style that is to say that it is not of poor or moderate craftsmanshipfinish nor is it something that i would rate as outstanding the quality of the piece is such that i feel it is a good value for the moneybr br finally as with many products of this type the value that a consumer sees is dependent on the expectation when i ordered this product my expectations were moderate especially because of the price in an age where we demand low price but often want high quality it is often best if we expect moderate to good quality instead i did that with this product as was pleasantly surprised to find that the quality was at least good if not just a tad bit better than good for that reason and those set out above id make a recommendation to buy this productbr br note i received this product at a reduced cost in exchange for the promise to file an honest and unbiased review to meet that obligation i typically use the product for an extended period no less than two weeks and under the typical conditions that one might use for a product of this type,2
these shorts while nice do run small the size chart shows that the xl are 3638 but fit more like a 36 then 38 i would go a size up if you are thinking about getting these the length is also shorter then i expected of other similar style shorts i havebr they fabric feels like a nice pair a swim trunks,0
these are attractive sunglasses and fit comfortably i am very happy with my purchase,2
i received a ton of compliments on this skirt but it was a little big in the waist i wish i would have gotten a m instead of a l,2
i bought this watch less than a week ago and has some issues already first the watch states its waterproof not that i shower with it which i dont and has accumulated moisture inside the watch i do the occasional hand wash and for it to do that was quite shocking in addition to the moisture after wearing it one day the following day the watch seems to not keep adequate time i have to adjust it daily because it is 510 behind so i just stop wearing it waste of money in my casebr the band is long so it may need to be adjusted and seems like it should hold up to daily wear and tear but other than the issues above i will not be buying from this brand anymore,0
after reading several of the reviews i took a chance and bought these earrings they were perfect for what i needed a simple pair of gold studs the earrings themselves are fantastic the backings however leave a little bit to be desired the dont feel very secure when you put them on but if you have another pair of earrings with a more supportive backing you can easily solve that issues other than the backing issue its a no brainer to buy these at such a reasonable price,2
the frog and the cat both broke within a week of normaly ware,0
really like this suit fabric very comfortable however the length is very short returned for a refund,0
sits off to the side crap material and hot,0
12 carat diamond stud earrings well you get what you pay for price is pretty good 299 but the quality is what you pay for i got these as a gift and i also bought another pair for a gift from a retail store used the retail store used earrings were a much better quality but also cost 800 these arent bad just a bit cloudy hardly any 34fire34,1
not bulky and extremely warm,2
when i was washing the dishes the nightgown got wet and the blue came off on my fingers when i touched it the quality was poor and it wasnt as nice as the other ones i bought i have to throw it away,0
cute in theory but they were way too small for my face,1
not true to size need to order at least 2 sizes larger,0
great product,2
these are really cute but they run small i ordered a 6 because i normally wear a 55 and these just barely fit the sole is a little padded and the strap is soft very cute just order a size up,2
cheap handle ruins the entire bag,0
do not buy its not even tailored properly the fit was very weird,0
constantly having to place arm of glasses back into croakies,0
i am loving this bundle pack there is so much variety in the styles i am having a lot of fun changing these nose rings up,2
glass scratched,1
you get what you pay for its not a quality cz but i was hoping for something a little better its something i wear to change things up it has okay 34fire34 its pretty,1
much smaller then anticipated really disappointed,0
okay it appeard to be silver,1
nice top but too small for sizes listed on product page,1
looks decent,1
cleans shines and polishes great cloths,2
nothing like the picture,0
they will not fit maui jim sunglasses,0
very cute and have received lots of compliments runs a little smalli wear a 9 and ordered a 9 toes were at the end and it made my big toe not feel too good uncomfortable to walk in after awhile a larger size might feel better on the plus side did i say how cute they are my foot is narrower and while the shoes did not hug my foot tightly they were not too wide,1
la botella funciona limpia bien pero tienes que usar bastante producto el cepillo muy pequeño y la toalla es innecesaria por el precio puedes encontrar algo mejor,1
it is very rough on the outside must wash it before you wear it wasnt quite as stiff after washing but still not very good quality,0
this jewelry is great for the price,2
liked that it was smaller than i expected big might have made it too gaudy shines beautifully so worth the small price and earrings beautiful too,2
perfect,2
these are white dress socks who wears white dress socks they also dont stay up in a couple hours they are at your ankles,1
fruit of the loom apparently has gone south i purchased a few packages through the year thinking i got a defective bagbr br 1 they run very smallbr 2 material is alarmingly thick and feels almost like 34cardboard34br 3 they shrink considerably after first washbr 4 stains will not come out no matter what i didbr 5 i swear this underwear is more within the parameters of disposable,0
señores que puedo yo decirles si no ha llegado a mi casa en ningún momento pero sí fue cobrado en mi banco de esto ya hace unos cuantos meses por favor mándenme otra pieza en reposición de esa que nunca llegó gracias de antemano por su atención al presente reclamo,0
fell apart when my wife put it on,0
great polo for all occasions,2
i currently own two i think these bags are very useful one can carry 2 handguns easily in this bag and have mags ammo and accessories i have fit 3 handguns gloves ammo small targets and mags in this on one of my trips to the range decent quality for the price some walmarts sell this this product as well i purchased min from wm for about 15,2
i really wanted to love these i love the idea of them and a lot better looking and more sleektrim fit however the left shoe is just not comfortable and i cant wear them not sure if it is the stitching or what i tried without socks with socks doesnt matter,1
they run small and therefore were unable to be used by the person i purchased them for i was going to return them but there had been a limited amount of time and there would have been aprocess to go thrugh and money lost so i am hopeful to find someone who they will fit and will like them,0
i absolutely love this coverup but washed it once and it shrunk and no longer fits either order a bigger size or dont put in dryer,1
the best hat ever i have five now need more thank you,2
it took a long time to get here but im satisfied with my purchase it fits nicely and i love the tie detail on the sides i would recommend this product,2
theres no structure to speak of and its illfitting it does not flatter ones figure at allbr the neck is very loose the waist and hips are loose the back is extremely tightbr br i do not recommend this cheap piece of garbage,0
cow mask is cute but omg the odor the smell permeated my hands and i could not wash it off for days i soaked the mask in baking soda and vinegar which helped a bit and let it air out over a month before using it i also airbrushed the mask a different color and the paint seemed to help seal in the terrible odor finally after all this the smell is gone dont plan on using right away if you get it im not usually bothered by smells but this was ridiculous,0
too heavy,1
although these boxers are well made and comfortable they lack a front fly i found this somewhat peculiar although not unheard of however in my family most males over the age of five prefer a usable fly i contacted kenneth cole customer service to inquire whether this was an oversight a design decision or a new trend i was informed this product is designed to contain no fly so although they are big for me they work well as sleep shorts the different shades of blue ligh cadet and blueblack are nice the elastic has good stretch and doesnt bind and the cotton material is cool and comfy these launder well if you buy make sure your guy doesnt want a fly,1
prettyish not super great material not super great sewing just not super anything,0
well my top got lost in the mail i requested a refund they refunded 2 change the top cost 2083 not sure what the 2 refund was but it wasnt the scrub top my son is a front line worker he loves star wars and mandelorian this was supposed to be a birthday gift no exactly pleasedbr after contacting the company again they did reimburse more than was stated br after this i might at some point check them out again,1
material is nice bought one size up so it would look like pic based on other reviews neckline is small and sweater is boxy not super flattering but kept for cold nights by the fire,1
not what i expected i wanted satin this is plastic dull and wrinkly,0
they are comfortable small feet beware they are too big and just slide off might as well not be wearing anything i had to buy tighter fuzzy socks and i just put these over them,1
i did not like the fact that the pants looked as if they had been worn they had dirt around the waist there were no cleaning directions on the inside of the items wrinkled very badly,1
not impressedcould have more cushioning on footbed its been pretty cold here pa last winter as for warmthsoso ive had warmer and more comfortable boots for a lot less,1
cheap looking and is discolored already lhj florida,0
the material is not very soft as i would expect to start with another thing is that their sizes are not as you would think they are they are 12 sizes smaller im 510 185 lb male my regular size is xlbr but this disney size tshirt sizes are very misleading i knew about before hand thus i ordered xxl it fits good another thing is that sizes l xl and xxl sleeves are the same diameter around the shouldersbiceps keep that in mind if you think that that particular tshirt area will come larger accordingly to the size ordered it is not so i have ordered three sizes to test them out l xl xxl all the same in the arm sizebr i like them but i would never pay the regular price clearance price offer,1
so rad so comfy so funbr id give this a full 5 stars if the top green felt part was removable for washing,2
i have socks like these i bought a few years ago and loved them they were thick comfortable fit great quality and lasted long i ordered more from amazon because i couldnt find them in the stores anywhere however the quality of the socks i received are not nearly the same as what i bought a few years ago they are very thin and light like a sock that would be worn with a mens dress shoe i can see my toes through them and my feet arent warm not happy with how cheaply they are made now i kept them anyways and am seeing how long these last vs the old ones,0
runs small and clingy,1
fell apart after first wash disappointed with quality,0
ver comfortable soft and cute loved it runs a bit small,2
my son loved the shirt and i loved how fast it was delivered until i washed it and it shrunk in the dryer it shrunk vertically so it cannot be worn anymore,0
horrible fiti threw the thing away because it was too late for returning,0
i really like that this is one of the few bras that delivers on minimizing but for comfort not so much first the fabric is a stiff net like fabric that is not soft and i find that wacoals run smaller i am a 38d in all other bras but i feel i need to go up a band size and cup size in this bra,1
it fit well in the bottom and hips but the front had so much extra material and was saggybaggy not cute and not comfortable bc i felt like i would have to keep pulling it up but you can only pull it up so high bc its not a high waisted bottom i sent i back i ordered a large,0
the slippers were so cute and comfy the only issue is after a couple months of wearing them the material started to come apart around the smiley face,0
dress was lovely but after even reading the reviews and buying a larger size the dress would not fit over my chest areavery disappointed great price though,0
i wanted to like this shirt but the tan color of the leopard seemed a little too pale for my liking the materials is a little slinky and very stretchy the black parts do stretch to show the tan underneath so be careful sizing down as you dont want to look too small it was very comfortable just not quite the look i was going for ended up returning,1
i am an xl in shirt size i read that this shirt ran small so i ordered a 3x but it its tiny so small it looks like childrens size it does not fit me at allbr do not order 3x unless you wear a womens small,0
its a nice design but poor quality fabric very thin especially for the price i would recommend finding yourself a better quality skirt,1
this is a perfect fit for my iphone5 it keeps me from having to carry a large purse when i only need my phone it also has pockets for license and credit card,2
thought they came in multi colors be careful if ordering if a mix is needed kept them anyway because do like them,1
dress fit fine and i liked the lightweight feel of the material but the smell is absolutely terrible i cant figure out what it is but i cant get rid of the smell and it is bad enough that i cant even wear the dress,0
got holes in them after only a few times wearing not the best made but pretty good for the price,1
the material was thick and hot the size was not true i wanted an xl but it fit like a m,0
way to small,0
definitely the best costume for the price,2
headline says it all i ordered the lavender and loved them the red striped pattern was only available in a size smaller than id ordered in the lavender and had they been the same material it wouldve workedbr br id caution against the red stripe unless you order a size or maybe 2 up,0
this is very cute especially for layering with other necklaces the links are a good size thickness yet it is dainty also for the price i am very satisfied,2
cute outfit,2
too is not made for larger breasts,1
i ordered an xxl and it would fit like a regular small im giving it to my mom who is 52 and 110 pounds very disappointed,0
this belt is everything the manufacturer said it is an attractive rich dark brown the leather and it is definitely real leather with a great leather aroma and feel is thick enough to wear well and supple enough to conform to your bodys curves comfortably the width of the belt slides easily though the loops on my jeans the buckle is a simple classic design and is made from real brassbr br there is a hole punch included along with instructions on how to shorten it if needed the belt arrives in an attractive substantial box making this an excellent choice for gift giving,2
it is misspelled dude is oude lame,0
i weigh 133 small boned 34b i couldnt get a size 12 over my arms i dont know what set theyre shooting for here but it definitely isnt american women,0
this fits great on a brittany spaniel,2
i dont think this luggage will last longer returning now cause i already have a similar one,0
i love this i took a chance buying clothes online and it worked out well with this one i ordered a medium i was nervous to but it fits perfectly i love the material soft inside im 54 and 160 i usually wear large but this worked will buy again,2
good value love the blue color recommend,2
poorly made,0
bought these for my mom to use for leaky bladder x large was tighter in the waist than expected but the holes for legs are way too big they gape in the frontthe elastic doesnt even touch her legs so no leak protection,0
i likeed the colorbr the earsocks are hard to replace and the nosepieces keep falling offbr ive already lost one,0
some of these were too small others ok nice variety and material,1
these shoes are not what i expected they have a cheap feel and look to them i was excited to try them because i have been looking for casual loafer type shoes i remember wearing boat shoes many years ago and liking them i wear a womens size 10 wide shoe this was supposed to be a mens 8 which is what i wear in mens shoes but i couldnt even get them on my feet theres also no support at all in them so even if they did fit i probably wouldnt wear them much,1
she was not a fan of crocs because of narrow feet but with these she wont take them off,2
im 58 187lbs and i usually like large shirts however when i got this one in a large it fit like and xxl otherwise its a nix shirt just order the size one lower than you usually would wear i shoulda got a medium thats my only issue tho,1
i was skeptical but ive used this on both chrome and black rims and it eliminates brake dust and cleans much better than others,2
these are pretty good but they run very small i usually order a medium and decided to get large but shouldve bought an xl,1
waste of my money,0
broken within minutes of me putting them onbr awful quality,0
didnt fit like i was hoping,1
seems to run small i ordered a small it did fit but definitely true to size runs very small so order larger if in doubt she says very comfortable,1
the polarized sunglasses came with protective soft tie bag and visor clip works great for over glasses and easy storage in the car when not in use love this pair of sunglasses quality made,2
decent quality for the price but i would say size down the bottom half the of the dress is very billowy and unflattering if its not the right sizing i normally am between a m and l and i would say move to the smaller size if youre between,1
ordered in navy and after just a month of water aerobics they have faded to a ugly bluish color i am careful to rinse them in clear water as soon as i get out of the pool and wash when i get home disappointed love the black they still look goodbr update the black pair has faded also after a few months of pool time waste of money,0
love it but im pretty 5 115120lbs and ordered l it fits but a little tight im thinking xl when ordering from chinabr so very fairy style,2
very cute but tiny for the price i returned,2
i returned this producti ordered the correct size per the size chart the top was shorter than what i wanted did not cover my mid section like the photo shows,1
surprisingly nice quality material and great for a simple but elegant dress but very form fitting i ordered a size up because its pretty snug,1
poor quality wont last couple wash and its useless waste of money,0
such a great print but made with flimsy rayon does not feel like it will last long and always wrinkled jake says aw man that is not the bees knees,1
comfortable fit,2
nice dress use size chart when ordering like the 34 sleeves so reasonably priced,2
nice looking but cheap clasp has fallen off numerous times and this time i lost it,0
great product and service,2
fits great comfortable really well made keeps from sweat accumulating under band,2
nice print but wayyyyy small like maybe 3 sizes too small,0
i was hesitant at first but will buy it again,2
hook bent easily just putting it in my ear,1
it was very thin but still cute so i wart it as a shirt instead,1
i ordered my size they are to small i followed the size chart i wish i had ordered a size up,0
great for the price black gloves have round white buttons at the cuffs i have large hands for a woman so the gloves are a bit tight and the fingers arent quite long enough however the set is great for a fun evening great addition to my collection of costumes,2
its not worth the money,0
very impressed my pair arrived in nice packaging and feel really sturdy wasnt expecting this quality of item given the price also surprised by the extra nose pads and screwdriver thats included will surely use joopin again,2
while i loved the outfit itself the first two times i wore it i was disappointed how it held up it looked like it had been worn several times the white ran and it just looked frumpy,1
the watch is just like i remember them when i was young it was a little uncomfortable but that could be because i dont wear watches that much very cute but i returned it,2
very thin material the fit is fine but the quality is cheap,1
can i get new ones had these only a month and a half run a little large,0
i really wanted to love this sweater but it just doesnt fit me well its adorable on the model but not on me it is a bulky sweater but the fabric is not stiff i think it just depends on the person and their body type if they can wear this sweater,2
really thin material shoulder pads were very obvious and awkward returned immediately,0
these are definitely big bright and noticeable but unfortunately one has started to tear right at the hole after only one trip these didnt stop the ground crew from abusing my bag either,1
it is on the smaller side the pendent looks good but not spectacular ok for everyday wear would not purchase it for a special occasion,2
this thing isnt strong enough to hold a single hat i own including super light weight straw hats very disappointing considering i brought it on vacation so i wouldnt have to hold my hat,0
good quality laces length matches what i ordered and the color looks close to the picture on line i like the look of these thin laces,2
not built for the long haul i bought this bladder 7 months ago i purchased it for longer trips where my 2 liter bladder is to small in the past 7 months that i have used the bladder maybe 10 times this month it started leaking where the hose connects with the bladder i did not like running out of water halfway into a 15 mile cross country mountain hike contacted the vendor and received no response,0
only second time putting this on and i went to zip in up and the metal on the zipper crumbled and broke off very disappointed and would not recommend this suit,0
i ordered xl because i have a big bust and even with xl i looked like a busted can of pillsbury biscuits,0
the quality of the material is really thin its not durable for more than one use,1
dress shrank first washing in cold water it started piling immediately,0
returning too big ordered for my mom she is 67yo its too flowerish,0
if you order the right size use a tape measure the fit is perfect its snug as its supposed to be and dont stretch through the day stays put and dont roll up i would definitely suggest these to friends bought this and some bottoms to wear together if given the choice i would order this brand again over the more well known and expensive name brands,2
many of the paws were missing one or more rhinestones i got them to sell at a bark in the park festival but only had enough complete ones for 2 earrings and one necklace im stuck with the rest until i can find small enough rhinestones to fix them,0
love the look and feel of the sweater just dont like the sizing,1
so glad i tried them on in the store because i was able to fit an 8 my shoes range from 89 depending on the shoe i wore regular socks no time required to break them in my feet got slightly hot but nothing crazy i have very flat and slightly narrow feet and these were comfy,2
i realize this bag is made super cheappoorly however i did expect it to last longer than a few weeks wish i could return it as it has fallen apart and isnt worth even bothering to try and keep fixing the pieces just fall off randomly save your money and buy something better thats my recommendation,0
my son was looking forward to these shoes until he opened the package and found a nice hole in the side of the sole can i have someone contact me on these these are not cheap shoes price wise but the durability is certainly questionable,0
they are lightweight great lenses and quality product comes with cases and mini screwdriver very professional and durable incredible for the price,2
the hands do not illuminate at night as advertised,1
love the shoes and myself and my daughter were excited about the charms it came with they were too small for the holes they dont stay in i added glue to the back helped a little but she already lost one in one day,1
fair price cat print art was basic color appeared to be slightly pink in the photo but is actually white lacks any wow factor,1
fitting not as expected,0
i ordered this a wedding bracelet for my wedding but when it arrived it did not meet my expectations it was rather tight on my wrist and just didnt pop like i expected and wanted it to so i returned it,1
does not look anything like picture will most likely return the item plus i do not think my wife will like the feel rough will see have been married for 47 yrs have a good idea what she will like more or less husband never really knows,1
material seems very comfortable the seam is right along the center inside of your leg so if you have larger thighs expect the seams to rub against each other i struggle to find compression shorts that arent made this waybr br if you are expecting actual compression then you deff dont want to follow their guide i was on the border between large and extra large per my waist size but was after the compression aspect so i ordered large thinking theyd fit snuggly these are barely tighter than boxer breifs im not sure right now if i should have gone with medium or small depends on how much they shrink hopefully a lot,1
i was disappointed that the blazer i received had a slightly different pattern than the one in the pic the zigzag pattern on my blazer was much wider this blazer is very light weight the material is very thin so you can see the color of the shirt you wear underneath the gold button is plastic and cheap quality so i just cut it off the sleeves are a little wide so if you have thin arms like me you wont be able to pull the sleeves up they just fall down im 5534 120lbs ordered a s i dont think its worth the 30 i paid for it,1
broke first day,0
these are excellent shoes after wearing them everyday for 2 months they are holding up great with no noticeable wear i buy shoes for over pronation and these are excellent for that this is the first pair of brooks that i have bought but not my last,2
looks great on and got a lot of compliments but doesnt give an inch measure carefully,2
cute but short,1
a small definitely did not make me look like the model in the picture its very scratchy fabric and it looks so very frumpy i dont really understand the reason for not having spandex its a wrinkly mass of fabric maybe an xs which doesnt exist would work but as is the neckline is too wide to look classy,0
very boxy im 5 5 160 a large to small after shrinks and extra large way to wide and boxy and the v notch in the neck was crooked,0
i bought these for my tennis clinic practice and for wearing to the gym i would like shorts with pockets but they are hard to find these are comfortable and i like the longer fit,2
i wear a size 11 wide and i found the size xl to be very comfortable these are great for people who need a wide width they are very soft material exactly what i had hoped for also the price was right its a good value and good for daily use around the house,2
had to return more like a 2x than a 5x,0
the watch was surprisingly more physically attractive than expected from the picture looks more expensive than it actually cost keeps very accurate time fits comfortably on the wrist strap is acceptable but would prefer different clasp may change the strap in future very easy to read time silver watch hands over dark green face love the watch,2
its a pretty color but its big on me also i had to have the sleeves shortened 34 inches increasing the price by 23,1
i have size d and these only worked an hour at best they stayed on but sagged after an hour i cant see how these would work for c cupbir larger at all,0
i have had a card holder for most of my career and as my last on has fallen apart i gave this a try disappointed in the craftsmanship stitching not great likely wont last long also a little surprised but the size is odd it is larger than a standard business card and leave a lot of room creats and odd fit not a big fan,0
i ordered these 12 slide buckles and was given 34 when i asked for the correct size i was given 34 again yes i measured the ones i need yes i measured the ones sent both times,0
cute but dont get it twisted they are dupes for sure and amazon endorses this shenanigans there are so many fakes on here its almost impossible to shop anymorethese are nice and pretty comfy for dupes but check this person who spots birk dupes page and out and they pretty much tick all the boxes,0
these re a little hard for me to get in but the colors are nice,2
the product started tearing near the bottom after the first few days of traveling other than the stitch quality i had no real problems with this pack,0
cheap fabric made me think of wife beater top im usually xs but medium was too tight im 52and 118 lbs,0
they loved the hats gave them for the rehearsal,2
one sleeve was longer than the other very noticeable,0
i love this crop top it does fit true to size but the arms are a bit small in the tricepbicep area and im not a big lady i do like my crop tops to be a little tighter so they hold in the girls i dont usually wear a bra with crop tops this is great tho the color is true and the length hits right at the natural waist it also holds its shape well it doesnt lose its shape or stretch out i dont dry it long tho about 5 mins and hang dry,2
great gloves super warm and soft,2
i absolutely loved this top it fits great and looked great but it is on the shein website for 5 vs 1699 on here it is the same top so that is a pretty frustrating price difference buy it off shein i returned mine and bought it off shein and i will attach a picture of the shein shirt on me i added the black tank top underneath im 55 and ordered an xl because i wanted it to be a little baggy so i would advise to size up,0
way to tight,0
i ordered a large which is what i normally wear but this shirt was hanging on me im 54 so maybe a taller person wouldnt have quite such an issue with the sleeves also i felt the shirt was on the thin side almost but not quite see through,1
i ordered a size up as suggested in the description when i tried the product on it came down way past my waist i am keeping it because of the price but i wont be able to wear it out to dinner dates or other noncasual events,1
the fabric is not very soft and the button is plastic which im afraid will break so careful when taking it off it fits ok not as snug as some brands are but not impressed over wish it was a nicer material not so rough,0
very very small order up two sizes,0
i forgot to see where it was made and was not happy to see that yep china i wonʻt forget again the fit is fine but the material is much heavier than i expected iʻm used to this style of nightgown being made with very thin cotton this is quite heavy which makes it warm itʻs okay as i used it as a dressing gown not to sleep in but i probably wouldnʻt buy it again if you like heavy nightgowns youʻll probably love it the pockets are fabulous i wanted to give it 3 ½ stars but amazon wonʻt let me,1
no this dress was ordered in small i normally wear medium dress looks like a piece of cheap material so big looks like drag on me wasted my money,0
great,2
three stars cause i got it to work so dont have to return yay and it does make it somewhat easier for the child to clip in three stars cause i have a common suv and had to use both holders to make this work even though it says fits most for reference i have a 2017 honda pilot touring so if you have two kids in boosters you may need four or longer ones thankfully only one of my kiddos is in need of this kind of thing at the moment the first holder went all the way below the buckle clearly not doing anything to hold up the straps that attach the buckle to the seat therefore not holding up the buckle at all it just flopped over so i decided to squeeze on the second holder to see if that helped it did these were hard to put on but i guess they should be so they grip the seat belt buckle good strong silicone see photo for my solution,1
in the picture it appears the chain the bird is on is connected to the leaves so the bird hangs below the branch a little bit in reality there is nothing to stop the bird from sliding up and getting caught on the leaf,0
as soon as i received this package i tried this on at home and then i spent like an hour to clean off the lints from this sweater i tried to clean all the loose lints from the sweater but in vain,0
i really like this product the material is really soft which feels good once you wear it i recommend it highly,2
such a cute dress but way too big for the size usually mediums dont fit like an extra large but this does i still have it and i just pin and wear a belt or sash to try and make up for the over sizing,1
i already did a review of the umbrella some time ago what can you say about an umbrella except it keeps the rain off,2
such a great idea are comfy stretchy and flattering fabric was stretchy and just like lulu my only issue is that i am very tall and these were literally closer to my knees that my ankles and i still debated on keeping them even looking ridiculous because they were sooo comfy unless theres an extratall addition im sadly out,1
i bought these shirts for my husky son when they arrived they looked okay but i always wash clothes before wearing them i washed them alone in cold water and dried them on delicates with minimal heat but they shrunk into doll clothes i was going to pack these for our upcoming trip in a few days but now i just wasted money and he doesnt have shirts so upset,0
i injured my foot and now find out years of wearing high heels and doing lots of exercise have created a condition called mortons neuroma i dont like most orthotic shoesbut i am so lucky because fit flops are not only beautiful but i can wear them in comfort i am addicted to them i have read other reviewers and i am finding out they are a national addiction these are wonderful beautiful and in a gorgous neutral shade,2
ive worn ariat cobalt boots riding horses for years and love them but theyve been discontinued these were recommended as a replacement they are awful the ankles are too big but put pressure on the achilles tendon the toe box is narrow terrible boots i wish i could return,0
used for homecoming looked really nice,2
quality not on par with cost,0
super cute and comfy if you want a crop top the picture is misleading,1
i just wanted a bra to wear u see t shirts etc around the house its very comfy i took the pads out and wear it without so comfy you could sheep in this im ordering more right now br donna,2
this is very cute and soft colors are vibrant and the unicorn face is adorable i had 2 problems with this outfit but they werent huge things one is that the zipper unzips very easily where my daughter is constantly zipping it back up if we were actually going out trick or treating this year i wouldve had to sew or safety pin it at the neck also she is 7 years old about 4 ft and 55lbs and i got size 68 its plenty baggy which is fine but the legs are strangely short and constantly riding up maybe i just got the wrong size overall a good enough product,1
it was a birthday gift,2
thin fabric and bright colorsbr not a great quality,1
too big i should have measured in millimeters the cain,1
these are a trendy look so i wouldnt want to spend more the earrings are thin and light not high quality i dont foresee them lasting for long the backs are clear plastic thats soft they came in perfect condition and quickly,1
this shirt is very comfortable it is very versatile and can be worn many places it fits well and feels very good we have other products from this company and have been happy with thembr br it is easy to wash and wear i wear shirts like these all the time because i would rather be comfortable it has a nice look to them it is flatteringbr br it feels durable i am pleased with the quality it is reasonably priced i would recommend this,2
its smaller than i thought its very light but the wrist band are very short is this really a watch for men is more a person with small wrist or decent size wrist this is more a watch for women in my personal opinion,2
sporty booby holders,2
this cotton and not linen dress runs small and a size 4 xl was too small for me i had to buy a size 5 xl just to get the fit of a 2 xl that i normally wear so i am returning the 4 xl and the 5 xl fits a bit better,0
this is not something i wear everyday so it has had gentle use the braided leather is coming loose from one side and will soon come apart i cant see a way of fixing this,0
comfy flops,2
the quality is poor and the earrings are much larger than i expected,1
return,1
i purchased these for my nightly walks with my dog and these stink first you would be better off without these gloves my hands felt like i had nothing on second after wearing them for 56 times splits in the seams on both gloves appeared i now have splits in 2 of 4 fingers on the right 1 on the left and the palm splitting on the left not a good product at all in my experience,0
absolutely perfect,2
was a gift and my friend loved it,2
shirt was the coolest for little guy he was able to wear it and be stylish all at the same time washed it once and dry it didnt shrink either so quality is good as well,2
this product is horrible quality i ordered one it broke the first time i wore it so i returned it the second one i wore today for the first time it broke too now i am past the return window do not bother buying,0
poorly made ripped in 2 different places along the seem of the sleeve,0
the pattern was irritating to my skin,1
would not send promised parts,0
dont buy it its cardboard literally very upsetting,0
this jacket fits as expected it is warm the jacket has many pockets that come in handy i love it,2
cute hat but not average adult size it fits my 9 year old daughter perfectly but can only sit on the crown of my head and of course it doesnt stay on,1
soft but soo super tight to get your foot into but it would be okay for a child with tiny ankles and feet,0
completely satisfied,2
,1
good quality and cute a bit larger than a normal size 4c though,2
material is slightly shiny but the waist on these pants is so sexy,2
look nice just didnt fit,0
i returned this purse i found no fault with the purse other than it was made from a different material than appeared in the picture it simply was not the style i prefer but the purse was well made and others may find it perfectly suited for their taste,1
this shoe is very stylish and pretty but is poor quality in my opinion the sole and bottom have no give its hard the fabric at the tip of the shoe buckles when you walk i returned mine,0
to large,1
my girl was able to feel the roughness of the plastic of these rings the more expensive version like enso ring feels much different and softerbr br i didnt want to give it any lower rating because everyone has different level of sensitivity so it might be okay for you in case your girl works in construction or somewhere similar,1
i ordered this in burgundy and it came in a slightly lighter color than i expected and the gem stones on the dress did fall off multiple times,1
comfy soft and has pockets can be dressed up or dressed downi love it,2
the center hole with grommet was to small i had to cut it out and replace with the grommet from my old umbrella they needed to be at least 1 inch in diameter,1
will not reorder,1
very well made,2
i love this its very pretty even though it doesnt look like the picture posted picture so you can see,1
these caps are huge even after washing and drying,0
the print is just painted on to a white fabric base with even a tiny bit of stretch such as at the bust the white material underneath shows through,0
i never received the little purse attached to it,1
i ordered these in sm size but they are too big very disappointed pay attention to the word 34unisex34 in the title these gloves even in a small medium size are clearly made for men also be aware these come from the uk so it will take 34 weeks to receive,0
i have narrow shoulders so the racer back allows me to forget about pulling up straps all day the lace and design are lovely and the style is very attractive and flattering it fits the underwire doesnt hurt great price jean bills wife,2
to cute but way to small it was a gift for my daughter who is a size small or xsmall got her the small and it was to small around the area where the arm meets the shoulder arm length was perfect bodice was a little snug as well it was returned,0
cute but there are ones that are adjustable and others that are not the ones that are not are too big for my nose so they just fall out and theyre the cutest ones,0
wore them for running snow blower o lu used 4 or 5 times before they started ripping between thumb and finger,0
i had to get the medium because im a 32d but it was too big around so if youre like a 34 d itll be perfect,2
good quality pants made for ants,1
baggy square shape,1
its for very wrong for me very small for me im very large for me,0
i use them in the water and going to the store very versatile,2
it is not that it is too large it fits great but is too long when i try the petite it is too short so i bought the regular and took up the length these pants are very comfortable and look great when i go out they have some give to them so they do not hurt my stomach,2
fit as expected but they had some embroidery on the pockets that i did not see in the pictures which i did not like,0
shines my jewels right up perfectly i am amazed at the difference now i need to find a cleaner for my pearls,2
to large,0
returned they are too big the weight of them makes them turn and look ridiculous so sad because they are gorgeous wish they made smaller ones,0
the sole of the slipper is definitely too thick my daughters foot slides off the side if she walks too fast she loves them though,1
my mom says these seem to work in helping with her circulation,2
i liked the design of these pant and i will wear around the house but they are a tad tight,2
for less than ten bucks i bought three of these great shirt,2
purchased this for my granddaughter the outfit is adorable but the shirt is about 4 sizes to small shorts maybe 1 size too small i guess its supposed to be a half shirt but even then its wayyyyy to small and inappropriate for school,0
unfortunately its too small,0
zipper broke the first time it was used,0
more like a nightgown,0
the item i received was not what was pictured i returned the item,0
they slide odd like all the others i have purchased,1
color not as expected,1
large and not too tightbr just what i wanted but were unable to find until now,2
light weight soft and comfortable,2
way way way too small i ordered a xl and it fit like a legitimate xs its extremely irritating so unless you are tiny i dont recomend this product at all,0
the shirt fit wellcomfy and soft great graphics,2
i like this suit fits well except not much support in top however i can wear a bra with it and it doesnt show,2
the magnet is soooo tiny i lost one within 2 minutes the earrings do look nice but the magnet needs to be a bit larger,1
i have been looking for these since sears discontinued them my husband has diabetes and a progressive neuromuscular disease these socks make it possible for him to put on independently they are not very thick but us in california with mild weather they are perfect not restriciting at all yet stay up,2
i love this ring i never take it off really cute and very nice quality,2
cute but i did run a little small and is itchyyy and not as high wasted as expected i am 510 and slim thick so maybe thats you,1
too small around waist but large up top i sent it back for a refund i was disappointed because it is a pretty blouse,0
cute top and flattering too one strap came unsewn after only wearing it once,0
seems to be good quality but way thinner than a sweat shirt more like a thick tshirt,1
a little tight for the dimensions i would make sure your apron is under the size,2
sticks to skin after a few minutes of wearing,1
colors shape size good for girls ages 510ish,2
description is incorrect these are for pierced ears not clip on they were also received broken with one stone displaced,0
these are cheap uncomfortable the design is already rubbing off and i only worn the green one for 2 days maybe they will make it through the holiday season but i would not buy again go find a better option for your money,0
i bought this purse for my daughter she liked it very much,2
i bought this bracelet for my wife last christmas and she loved it three months after the bracelet broke the end silver piece holding the beads on and i contacted the seller i was a little disappointed that their only reply was to order a new one with a link to the product my thought is if the first one broke after three months why would i buy a second especially when the seller replied the way they did i found a different bracelet from a different seller also be careful when putting on and taking off the wire can easily stretch,1
i ordered a black purple and gold one but received a bright turquoise and pink one,0
way to small unbearable,0
very small i usually wear petite watches but this is child size,1
this is so cute specially in the hood is up she looks so cute in it,2
amazon is sooooo clever you want all the same color well we can do that for an extra 5 10 or 15 depending on the day and our secret formula decent shirts but not at the price demanded,0
sleeves were too short,0
cute runs small,1
surprised by the color it was black,0
got this as a christmas gift for my boyfriend and he loved it its on his key chain currently the bit that holds the keychain to the rest of the keys fell apart pretty quickly but it was easy for him to put it on a different link would definitely recommend for the price,2
they work fine however my husband still tries to slip them through all the laces we go round and round about this i am trying to get him different laces that will be easier for him to use any suggestions,1
looks and feels very cheap i returned them,0
so pretty loved the look but as many reviewers have stated way too small since we read that beforehand we actually went up 2 sizes instead of 1 and even though our daughter has a narrow foot she still couldnt squeeze these on,0
i will give a review on the performance later the reason i have to give this to stars is that 1 of the pictures that made me purchase this was the fact that the site of the case showed the number of the amount of watches made according to the picture there were a 1000 watches produced when the package arrived today i notice that it was missing those very numbers on the case that was one of the main selling points for me is far as im concerned that is selling a lie amazon should be checking on companies like this,0
i love these sweat pants usually i have two other pairs this exact product that fit perfectly this pair is the same size as my other ones and the inseam is at least 6 inches longer love the sweats but dont understand why there would be such a discrepancy in sizes,1
such cute socks my 22 month old boy loves to look at all of the different colors on these they fit perfectly and there is room for stretching excellent quality would definitely purchase again,2
love the necklace shape however not so crazy over the color i picked the mint green looks very cloudy in the jewels not a fan,1
i really like these gloves but the left one is a size bigger than the right,2
way too big missed return date,0
i was so in love with these shoes when i opened the box last night just had to plug my nose to get around the strong chemical smell i put dryer sheets in the box overnight hoping it would help alleviate the strong smell it worked to some extent but not all the waybr i was super excited to wear the wonderful shiny gold platform nature breeze size 6 shoes to work this morning they fit great and were for the most part comfortable although the sides of the shoes felt sharp on the bottomsides of my feet after the first hour that seemed to go awaybr at 1000 am pst ide been wearing the shoes for about 3 12 hours and the bottom insole of the left shoe started to bunch up and come out through the toe area not to comfortablebr as i tried to straighten it out the whole thing came out so i super glued it back in i mean what am i going to do im at work i cant run around barefoot or with one shoe hopefully the glue holds and it doesnt happen to the right shoebr i would give a higher rating otherwise theyre super cute but boy do they smell and now they have super glue smell added to itbr im pretty sure that i would order from nature breeze again hopefully the next ones wont smell,1
this is a great brand i was dismayed when the shoes didnt fit i already own the same brand size and color,0
the images make band appear to be robust and thick not the case same flimsy thin band as original disappointed not worth returning either,0
fit as expected material is soft and comfortable pockets are decent size good item for the price you pay,2
omg i never thought i would find a comfortable bra im 52 118lbs and a natural d cup underwires are so uncomfortable but i am 50 years old so need a little lift this broad does the trick it looks amazing under tshirts sweatshirts and shirts that are full coverage unfortunately it does not work under tank tops or sexier shirts but im pretty outdoorsy and rarely dress in anything revealing this bra is definitely worth the money and i will most likely end up ordering a couple more,2
runs too small too tight,0
im in love its so pretty and looks so good fits perfectly maybe a little tight trying to get it on at the shoulders but really not a problem i would buy 50 dresses just like it,2
these were orange not reddo disappointed,0
the idea is fantastic the design isnt the best theres something about the color of the pin that the actual taco blends in with the white background so you dont really see what is it until you stare from reeeeal close i guess the picture is pretty accurate about it i just didnt realize this until having the actual pin too bad,1
not as pretty as expected,1
good quality glasses its if you can get the right color and the bag,1
i like the look of these industrial barbells but the paint already is coming off on one of them,0
i originally purchased the larger size as i have larger legs and they were way to big so i got the smaller sized and they are still way to big despite using the measurement guide included offers no compression due to not being the appropriate size,0
we ordered a size 14 for our girl who wears size 12 it was too small we returned and got a size 16 and it still looks as though she is stuffed in it we got a size 12 from another vendor and it worked fine so be aware of sizing aside from that the material is all right feels soft shed have enjoyed it i think if it had fit her we did not return she removed the tags before i could get to it,1
i absolutely like the rich color as well as the shape and size of the bag would recommend for purchase,2
this wallet was horrible i bought for my husband as a gift the very first time he used the wallet it ripped it is very cheap,0
way too small,0
cute,2
my 13 yr old son got this hat he loves it and it fits perfect,2
color and style,1
the dress is well made and well stitched the fabric is slightly stretchy and lightweight pleasant to the skin the cape like sleeves are attached to the shoulders while the dress fits true to size i look like overstuffed sausage in it even while wearing shapewear it shows every single roll and imperfection i have and i have to tell you it does not look attractive at all plus the lower part of the dress keeps rolling up my legs and gather at the apex of my thighs when i walk in it i am in favor of body positivity but unfortunately imo this dress would look smashing on a slender willowy body rather that curvy heavy boned like mine,1
the gloves are definitely warm but not what i expected i thought that they opened up where the velcro meets the glove so i could see my son slide his hand in its a fully closed glove and the velcro portion doesnt help tighten the glove around the hand as my son is playing in the snow the gloves as constantly sliding off regardless of how tight i attempt to wrap the glove disappointing,0
very nice tote bag for the price i thought the top zipped the entire bag but it only encloses the middle section good value,2
too small acrid mid section,1
not true to size very narrow,1
this is a nice low impact sports bra in my opinion it runs a little large im a 32dd so i ordered a medium probably could have used the small there was something plasticy poking me from the threads near where the strap meets the front of the bra but i managed to snip it out with scissors and it didnt effect the bra at all,1
so many ask where i got these necklaces i am in love with them go so nicely with my outfits will buy more,2
these sandals are comfortable easy to put on and take off they have three adjusted straps so you can the perfect fit they have decent arch supportbr br for me the width was perfect but they are a little long also the insole is a bit slippery so you have to use the straps to keep your feet from sliding around in them,2
fit perfectly the stand is a little hard to open i chipped a little bit of the design away trying to open it i use a paperclip and it opens right up perfect for reading my books,2
hat was too big for a little girl or even a small women was poorer quality than expected returned,0
hated it,0
the head portion if the hat is to short measuring from where it meets tge ears to the top of the head,0
the need for face masks will probably be done before this arrives for you,0
very pretty necklace had been searching for a lariat necklace since watching beauty and the beast the quality of this is great nice finish and workmanship it was a but longer than i wanted the bar hung too far down my cleavage and into my shirt using my jewelry tools i snipped off two inches of chain and reattached the loop now its perfect,2
these are really cute and made my butt look great but they are extremely uncomfortable to wear for longer than 5 minutes the stretchy material that pulls right at your butt crack is so uncomfortable and made my butt so sore just dont theyre cute but the pain isnt worth it,1
in the add no where does it say made from rip stop material they are all putting zippers in the cargo shorts also 2 strikes 42822,0
this was a birthday gift the stitching separated by the zipper the first time she wore them however she hand sewed the holebr they really look nice on her and flatter a curvy woman nicely makes the booty popbr i would have give a 5 if it hadnt pulled apart at the zipperbr howevereasy fix,1
i own so many bvlgari sunglasses they are all so beautiful and have great lenses this one doesnt the brown lenses are very dark i could barely see something with it will return,0
not as good quality as i expected,0
this towel was too short for the price,2
35 stars i purchased this as a gift for my partner who loves the dark souls games as other reviewers mentioned the material of this hoodie is slick not fleecy like a traditional hoodie but i knew that going into it and it works well for my partner who actively prefers that feeling it is still thicker than some printed hoodies of this material and is wellmade the print is actually quite high quality and true to the listing photobr br however my only qualm and the reason im not rating higher is in the sizing i noted before buying where other reviewers mentioned sizing up so i did and the product that arrived is amply wide would not want to go wider but really really short for a hoodie skimming the tops of his pants at best like if you lift your arms slightly your belly will show this reduces its warmth and comfort so keep that in mind thankfully my partner is relatively short so i do not recommend this item for taller people unless you really enjoy your hoodies croptop style,1
metal is very light hardly feel weight of ear rings lost one without noticing bummer,1
the quality could be better,1
what arrived was 34super stretch 34 the search for jeans without any spandex continues returning,0
too big,0
they lookfeel great and the color is vivid but not off putting,2
wearing these and a smaller pair almost everyday i have to buy more cause i can see myself wearing these all the time once it really starts getting cold,2
i didnt usually wear slippers i was usually barefooted around the house but i love these slippers so much i keep them by my bed and slip them on as soon as i get up no more cold bathroom floors they are super comfortable and easy to slip on and off no bending down to put them on,2
looks good fits perfectly dont love below the waist waistline but if you dont mind that they are a nice color a slightly lighter weight denim and they are well made and incredibly reasonably priced,1
i ordered this same necklace for my husband for christmas i then ordered again just repeated the order for my brother in law for his birthday however what came was some type of bracelet he opened and i was very embarassed as it was not only a bracelet but a womans and it had some kind of linkage attached to it,0
cute glasses but fit is weird,1
the filgate leather wallet kit model hsw181w3 has two credit card pocketsslots and a coin bag that snaps closed the entire wallet is a bifold that snaps completely shut this wallet is more appropriate for teens and preteens than it is for adults why is that because we adults simply have more personal items that need to be kept in our wallets not all of my cards can fit inside this filgate wallet which is made of 100 genuine leather a man of fiftyfive has more insurance cards business cards and credit cards than a teenager or young adult in collegebr br one of the credit card pocketsslots the lower one was nearly too small for inserting my cards on the other hand the coin bag was of sufficient size i only need to carry a few quarters dimes and nickels for the soda machine at work once in a while ill get a craving for a soft drink normally i make my own with my sodastream that was a gift from a friend the bifold is large enough for carrying paper money i dont carry that much in my wallet i use credit cards for purchasing most everything even the soda machine at work takes a credit cardbr br however with this filgate wallet the righthand edge of the bifold is not sewn it flaps open wide whenever the wallet is unsnapped money receipts extra cards and anything else stored inside the bifold can fall out and become forever lost i would feel more comfortable about carrying this wallet if the righthand edge of the bifold was sewn overall the filgate leather wallet kit model hsw181ws would make a great christmas or birthday present for a teen or preteen it would make a great 34first wallet34 it is too compact for all of my personal belongings,1
the glasses seem clownishly large and though they are lightweight and decently put together i dont see myself recommending them because of their price but to each his own other reviewers seem to like them its too late for me to send them back so theyll become a backup pair,0
shipping was fast but the item looks very cheap ill give to my daughter and buy something else,0
it was too small,1
2 of the 3 were great 1 has very scratchy connections and the clasp is not secure,1
over all the bag is cute but the straps are made way to long and are adjustable but still way to big for a child,2
boots arent bad looking or uncomfortable i didnt like the leather feel and scratches like someone used them already if you dont care abot the material go for it,1
i have bought winter silk over the years and now that they are out of business i had to get this this item is extremely light and it beads up ive never had a winter silk long john bead up on me this thing is textured whereas winter silks products are smooth with exception of their pointelle line their cheapest and flimsiest winter silk had different grades light mid weight and heavyweight this is not good as a base layer,1
very very very long,0
loved this top initially when i tried it on i actually wore it today for the first time its kind of tight on my boobs but fit is otherwise good i bent over to grab something off the bottom shelf of the fridge and the button in the back snapped off instantly had it on less than 5min dont wear if youre going to be moving around a lot im 54 120lbs and 34d fits my body really well but not enough room for my boobs hence the snapping definitely not for girls with larger chests,1
i was disappointed in this purchase because my daughter has the deluxe rapunzel costume from this vendor and absolutely loves it this costume is very nice on the top but the bottom is not very good at all the cape needs to be longer and more fabulous the skirt fabric is an unusual material i returned it and amazon made the return very quick and easy i will try this vendor again bc i had such good luck with the rapunzel costume but i will be cautious due to this bad purchase,0
this dress runs small and the material seems a little flimsy,1
watch had large digits easy to read and contains day of the week month time and seconds at a glance without having to push any buttons i hate watches where i have to press a button just to get the date seems to be water resistant enough because i dont remove it when showeringbr br sometimes the button that switches from 12 to 24 hour time gets pressed accidentallybr br pros br good buy at 24br large displaybr water resistantbr br cons br 1224 hour button can easily get pressed accidentallybr br verdict br buy if you like a simple logical watch,2
very thin not like other bandanas,0
well worth the price,2
i bought this for my job winter is here and gets very cold i picked these particularly bc of the inner lining that looked warm and comfortable the material seems good light rain will definitely not wet the pantsbr however sizing is a big issue i bought a size 30 waist the bdu is much bigger than 30 i wear 30 for other bdus and jeans they all fit fine in the picture you can see how much space is there,1
cute ideabr looks a little cheapbr zipper is terriblebr never got it zipped all the way then it broke,0
product fit as expected but i didnt like how it looked on me particularly so i returned it,1
very good quality and fits good,2
ran a little large and i didnt love the way the material laid returned,1
i was a little weirded out by the fabric when it arrived im wearing for the first time right now for the pittsburgh steelers game its sooo comfortable i love it its very soft and it washed very well,2
love this dress i ordered it in two patterns and they both look great they are super comfortable and the pockets are a definite plus they are perfect to throw on when i need to run out of the house or to dress up for church or a summer evening out i am about 56 and wear between a size 68 and a medium fit perfectly,2
beautiful but the chain at the end of the wings looked bad it kind of reminded me of a little girlsomething bracelet for a vending machine the only thing that that looked good was the wings and the pearl,1
runs a little bit smaller than most size mediums so get next size up when you order,1
the fabric was see through,0
like the picture fabric is cheap no zipper tvos is a pull on dress the fabric is super thin and stretchy will only look acceptable in a picture i guess you get what you pay for,0
it was just like the picture but the little chains broke from the clasp it was in,0
it is very soft light warm fits bigger than i thought it would inner button fell off first time i put it on buttons do not stay buttoned have got compliments on it just disappointed in the quality,0
okay,1
crap,0
the clasp broke the first time i took it out it fell off my keys without me noticing and got lost day one if you buy this use a more secure fastener,0
this cute tshirt dress runs big i kept it hoping it would shrink in the dryernope but im glad i kept it just next time ill order next size down,2
well it shows you get what you pay for cheaply made and very small will give it to my 9 year old granddaughter to play with,0
beautiful purse wish the wallet was a flip open one bigger than what i thought thanks,1
i like yellow and i have several tie dye items as im a true hippie from the 70s but whoever did the colorpattern on this jersey knit really needs to have their eyes examined becausewhewugly is just ugly okay beyond the colorpattern this is a really nice summer pajama set and i love how it fits and feels against my skin i have some tie dye fabric dye and may do a bit of repair to make this nice pj set prettier but i cannot fault it in any way for wearability love that part of it,2
the material is not of the best quality i am a size 1618 and this did not fit me at all i am a curvy plus size woman and the 3x was more like a 1x i couldnt fit my arms in it not worth it honestly,0
i have an average size head and this hat was too small plus it could have been packaged better it arrived rather smashed and even after much reshaping already looked worse for wear usually hats like this are rolled up and placed inside a tube for shipping but this was just sent as is in a plastic wrapper with some useless protective paper i gave it a three because the hat itself is of good quality,1
this is a very nice hat but not 5 stars because it is a bit big for a woman and the brim is huge and the head portion is large also i would expect it to be sized more for a woman it will fit if i tighten it up a lot but will be high,2
a place for credit card,2
socks for pretty tight but i think they are supposed ro,2
it would be impossible to wear a sock of normal thickness under this boot,0
the design of this suit and the pattern color combo is super cute however the sizing is way off the bottoms fit fine but the top part was extremely small literally like child sized you would have to be a 24aa cup size to fit into this so if you have any chest whatsoever you mind as well just forget about this one it is such a bummer because again i though the style was adorable perhaps i got a defective one because i am not sure who the manufacturer would expect this bathing suit to fit i really wish it would have worked out,0
a looker the size is on the smaller side for most larger men comfortable in feel and mechanically straight forward as are all bands that use versions of the original mount style,2
i love this shirt like other reviews have said the fabric is stretchy and loose but still thick enough that there is no need for an undershirt its flattering and super comfy my only complaint is that they dont have it available in an xs im 5 feet tall and 115 lbs and while a size s fits well it would look less baggy in an xs doesnt stop me from wearing it though planning to get one in white next dont let the username fool you i share this account with my husband,2
holds everything and many compartments would like in a different color than blackkinda boring for me,2
arrived today color is an exact match very roomy it does look a bit cheap though,1
i love these shoes supper cute im a size 65 and there a little big in the heel but perfect otherwise i have since bought another pair in size 6 and will use the bigger pair for my thicker stockings love love love,2
the o ring slipped off they sent extras but no one seems to know how to put the o ring back on whats up with that,1
had these pants for one day fit perfectly i put them on the next day and theres little holes all over the butt i would not buy these pants again and would like my money back,0
amazing i love it,2
when i first opened this i thought wow thats really long it turned out to fit an 18th month old perfectly our baby weighs 23 lbs and it fit well well made and very pretty,2
i love the softness but these socks slip down completely into my shoe its the nature of the fabric i suppose and the fact that they are not knee length i was willing to try them and i can use them for 34slippers34 around the house,1
nice quality but order much larger than you normally wear and dont order if you have a wide foot,1
geniune replacement,2
it doesnt actually glow unless u have time to charge it under a black light and even then it barely glows in the daylight,0
got this for daughter for open to elements job way too thin she wants more cottonwool flannel fabric not polyester feel,0
loved it all it needed was to be dry cleaned to get rid of the wrinkles but its way too see through with the white color,1
returned these right away super small super narrow and super stiff too bad because i feel like they had potential,0
this top is very thin i use it as a pj top,1
i purchased 2 dresses feom this seller the black floral dress was perfect length was just above the knee and fit just as expected elsewhere i would give this dress 5 starsbr br the red paisley dress was however a different cheaper fabric the stitching looked like a 3 year old sewed the dress the cut of the paisley dress around the arms and chest was too large and gaped horribly and the dress was much shorter i would give this dress zero stars,0
love these well made hold up to repeated washing and remain comfortable all day,2
sadly revision of rating die to it breaking in under a week of use disappointingbr i got this to replace my 34rubber34 band that caused skin irritation and a rash i love the look the feel and no rash the only thing to note is the sharp stabs of pain as your arm hair is plucked one by one due to the links that wish to have smooth baby skin contact and not hairy man surface but meh who needs hair there rightbr would recommend hey you get freemanscaping this productbr it even comes with a tool to easily remove links to correct the sizing to ensure maximum skin surface contact,0
these no tie kids shoe laces are absolutely perfect for my son he is seven and knows how to tie his shoes just not very well he has a pair of red sneakers that the laces are thick and a little short so whenever he comes home from school his that pair of shoes are always untied i put these no tie shoe laces on his shoes which was was fairly easy and now we have no problems his shoes are now nice and snug yet easy to slip onbr sample provided for review,2
great fit great deal,2
eh,1
very cheap looking plastic,0
the watch band fell apart at the hinge that connects the bracelet links to the base of the apple watch connector see photos the watch band initially left the impression of a highquality product however a screw appears to have fallen out of on the end of the band and it is caused the entire connection part of the band to come apart rendering the product unusable the break down occurred at 46 days after receiving the watch 15 days outside of the return window my use case was daily office wear and going out on the weekends to dinner or run errands the band was not worn during workouts yardwork etc,0
eh,0
frans and cannot wear threw it away,0
ok,2
as a smaller individual was looking for something that wouldnt leave an enormous flap since i often have to wear belts on the first hole even when they say size small thought id take a chance on these and am so glad i did i love that i can wear these under shirts without a bulge and that i dont have to take it off when going to the bathroom its much more convenient than a regular belt and i appreciate that its snug in fitting my small waist for larger individuals itd likely be a decent fit too because it will stretch to fit and is easy to adjust two thumbs up,2
i like this top its very cute it does run large as others have said but that worked out well for me since ive gained some extra pounds in the last few months i am 5334 and the sleeves are a little long easily solved by pushing them up a little nice length not too long for short me quality is good especially since it was made in china speaking of made in china it is literally shipped from china and took 5 weeks from order to delivery dont be in a hurry for this top when you order it,2
amazons ad is inaccuratei was expecting a high gloss high textured top grain leather bag instead what i received is dull and mediocre this bag will not accommodate cell phones beyond 5 tall,1
i hoped these tinted glasses would greatly reduce the glare of nighttime driving but the effect was barely noticeable very comfortable however and frames feel strong and look attractive,1
these frames help keep your mask off your nose and mouth directly but do get moist and need to be removed and cleaned to be comfortable when wearing masks for a long time they help not feeling smothered,1
just the size i was looking for,2
not the same as the picture it did not come with embroidery it was just gold printed not what i expected,0
the fit is so weird it should be off the shoulder with the lace acting like the straps but its sewn too close together so it just looks like i have lace bra straps showing and my shirt is falling down,0
im a woman that wears an average hat size im always interested in reviewing gaiters the first ones out were quite small clearly designed for an asian market the sizing has gotten better and this is one that i can get behindbr br first let me say that i thought it was a bit tighter around the neck than i personally like but i think that has more to do with the fabric not being as stretchy as others the sewn seams seem a bit scratchier than others ive tried too however once its on the gaiter is quite comfortable it sits loosely around my ears but not so loose that it slips down it will i think work well on a mans face because of the extra room so that definitely is something to consider i get around any fogging of my glasses by just pulling the mask over my nose and sitting my glasses on top i also prefer the bandana style bottom because when the gaiter is pulled down theres less fabric bunched upbr br please be aware that while these may fulfill your areas requirements for wearing masks air passes through them quite easily and i dont feel confident theyll do anything to stop a virus they will however stop dust pollen and bugs i took off one star because of the lack of stretch in the fabric and because of the kinda scratchy seams but i will still be happy to recommend this because of the way it fits it really is unisex and i believe most men would be able to wear it comfortably,2
pure quality fabric beautiful to see and feel this is my nicest shirt by far,2
great print good fit,2
beautiful a lot of compliments easy to wash and dry fast so for traveling for business it is a great impression,2
no es de buena calidad,0
these are comfortable and look nice but they are too form fitting more like leggings than pants,1
these are super comfortable and soft to wear the compression liner is a bit loose so size upbr br the phone holder is useless depending on your phone iphone 13 just jangles around and smaller phones might work better,1
really pretty but very small,1
bought this for my 15 year old she loves it,2
pretty disappointed there are no sequins on this shirt as advertisedjust a stick on picture of a wine glass also runs small,0
this is ok the shorts are almost too long though i decided to just hang onto it,2
pretty ring with a lot of stylenice price too,2
i like them i use them for work,2
even though size was specified it 34seemed34 bigger than imagined,1
i am 54 and this dress was too short for me also the stitching was not the best i ended up keeping it and giving it too my daughter,1
i like this jacket enough that i wont return itbr the sleeves are extra long which is a bonus the body part is short though it hits barely at the waist the jacket has no liner it says liner in the product description its a nice early fall or spring jacket i bought a 3x and it fits more like a 1x the fabric is super soft and ill update my review as time passes and i wear it more my last columbia jacket lasted 10 years before the zipper broke wondering how long this will,1
jeans are very well made and seem to be a quality product however i dont like the fabrictoo much polyester so im returning them hoping to find jeans with a higher percentage of cotton plus a little spandex this is a personal preference,2
48 pairs items arrived as described well packaged in double clear bag and velvet pouch so many different pairs to chose from and match your outfit of the day i have a nickel allergy and these are hypoallergenic so theyre ok for me to wear wont be shopping for earrings again anytime soon,2
cheapy made came apart,0
good fit for my swatch easy to install looks identical to origional one,2
the ring itself is really pretty but it broke after wearing it for about 2 days typical poorly made belly button ring,0
i first wrote a review about this shirt saying it was great except for the smell after i hand washed it in cold water which is a pain to have to do every time it needs washing and it still smelled like a chemical smell the dye faded over the right chest area leaving a white hole looking area that is very noticeablebr i would buy this shirt again only in a solid color and hope that the dyes are more stable,0
for one these pants are not as cool as they look in the photo what you receive will look cheap the material is not stretchy at all the fabric is like a cotton canvas it is stiff and not very soft also the sizes run small order at least a size or two up returning these because theyre not worth 25,1
cute,2
looks nothing like the picture at all cheap material,0
these are the best slippers i wear a 9 12 so ordered a 10 fit great in beginning but once the wool molds to foot they are a little big would rather that than too small though,2
this suit is wellmade and true to size the top has a supportive bra structure and the bottoms are generously sized,2
the underneth of this shoe is wayyyy to smooth i almost slip and fall it is made in all swade material,0
these were very disappointing the red is not red at all but an ugly burnt orange color the insole of one of the shoes comes out every time i take it off they are comfortable otherwise and im sure easy to clean but the insole is very annoying,0
gorgeous dressbr the only reason it is getting 3 stars is because the right side of the dress at the top is slightly bigger than the left side made slightly incorrectly,1
i love keens i was disappointed in these ill cut to the chase for some reason these dont hold my feet inside the shoe and with every single step my heels slide out of the shoe its a very disconcerting feeling for a shoe to feel like its going to slip off your foot with every step thank goodness i have decent thick socks but im sure this is a good part of the reason why some of my keens will wear inside of the shoe at the heel because they slip so much there will be a hole worn clear through the fabric from the rubbing while im on the subject of wear and tear keens do tend to wear down somewhat quickly i know that i put a lot of mileage on my shoes i wear the same ones every single day i walk about 1 12 miles a day on asphalt and i wear holes in my soles within months dont get me wrong im thankful for the softer soles and the very comfortable treads i would definitely notice if the treads were tougher rougher and less comfortable to walk on i just wish they didnt wear out so quickly or cost so much money for not lasting that longbr br other than that though they are comfortable breathe well fit true to size and are stylish,1
i like the material i ordered the black pair but will probably need another color or two br update i wore these for the first time and now im repairing three places where the stitching is coming out im afraid i had to switch from 5 stars to 3 stars on the positive side i found them to be true to size m and i do like the material,1
fit as expected and comfortable to wear i love it its good deal for the price fast delivery thank you,2
the color doesnt look the same at all the ones that arrived were completely black i loved these because of their heathered gray look and im so sorely disappointed that they did not arrive as expected,0
this shirt was very stiff and felt pretty cheap overall i worried the decal would come off after one wash,1
good fit as expected,2
i wear a 10 and couldnt get the dress over my head,0
a 2xlt is more like a 4xl,0
material isnt the best easy to wrinkle and the silhouette is a little weird at the top,1
these are nice size however some of them got creased in the box not sure if i can maybe steam the creases out,1
not my cup of tea buying a purse online is harder than i thought the has a lot of pockets and seems well made its too small and shoulder straps needs to be adjusted too much for my taste overall a good pursebr i did order a new sachet bag and will donate this bag,1
these pjs are great soft warmcool enough for whatever the weather but theyre thin as in you can see fine details under the pjs only real complaint,2
true to size nice hoody,2
just a little long in the legs,1
very nice but wrong order,2
first off the style was great unfortunately it is an odd fit my pinky was squished in the toe box but the boot was large everywhere else the arch didnt feel like it was in the right place either really wanted such a cute style to work but it was sadly a miss returning,1
shirt runs small,0
pretty bathing suitnot made for someone thats bigger than a b cup,0
the colors and variety is really nice the quality on the other hand could use some work lots of sharp edges that irritate the ears,1
i give this 4 stars because i loved it while it lasted but i took it on vacation and it ended up in the dryer and the suit completely gave up the boning ripped through the seams and it was completely ruined i know you shouldnt dry them bit sometimes things happen and its kind of disappointing how beyond saving one accidental dryer trip was however if youre very careful with it its an amazing suit its so comfortable and incredibly cute,2
too long and the cleaveage on the back too wide makes the fabric open on the sides,0
horrible def not for average women with any breasts need to be flat band binds under breast area and i am stuck with purchase as it is non returnable to kohlsbr i will always check for how i can return from now on,0
this is cute but it doesnt function as described it is supposed to be an earring cuff but it doesnt stand up so it just dangles and doesnt look good im returning it which is unfortunate because it would be cute if it functioned correctly,0
these masks are made well very thick material stitched together and thick band but the way the edges are sealed makes it hard scratchy and uncomfortable my sons skin was irritated by it because it was not softgentle to the skin wanted to love these but i dont recommend,0
my son isnt even 2 months old and its already tight on him hes 9lbs and this is supposed to be 06 months he got to wear it once,0
these are the most comfortable dress shoes ive ever had,2
cheap polyester fabric weird fit waist is too low just doesnt look good on me at all,0
returned,0
these earrings appeared well made and delightfully detailed my wife receives many comments and compliments about them so why not a fifth star the box they arrived in made them look like a dollar store purchase though the box usually gets thrown away these are worth a better initial presentation a minor complaint really certainly worth the br br consider buying the cat pin as well you wont be disappointed,2
perfect for my wedding day,2
beautiful classy looking shoe looks better in person than it does online,2
cute but the tail was held in with a single stitch and fell off right away,1
not sure it is definitely cute and drapes well the quality of the material is what scares mebr im not sure it will be the same dress after its washed,1
definitely runs small id recommend ordering one possibly two sizes bigger than what you wear it is made from halloween costume material so tent like materials not soft fabric it barely fit my daughter but worked for a one night wear on halloween it is short and multiple pieces,1
cheaper than i expected no shape,0
loved the sweater bright colors just too small had to return it,1
i like the size of this earring holder i bought the jewelry box and another of these i have many earrings that i can now easily to see and get to i use one of these boxes for holiday themed earrings and the other for my everyday earrings i use the jewelry box earring holders for my good earrings i am very happy with these displays they are beautiful and functional and work well together or by themselves,2
these were a gift i was disappointed with the quality,0
it was the right length and size in the waist but poor execution of idea returned,0
these are super cute i wear a 7 so i ordered a medium which fits perfect with a little wiggle room what i cant stand it they arecontinuously shedding the inner lining i have black fuzz all over the place,1
i liked it but the charms broke off extremely easy i lost the cameo my favorite charm then the whole bracelet snapped,1
size of stones look authentic natural sparkle next to my natural diamond cannot tell difference i will buy morebr br setting protects stones,2
these are very cute sneakers the lights work well my only complaint is that the laces came apart and they are sticking out of the shoe also the laces are not removable shipping took a bit but they are coming from china so that is to be expected,1
i ordered a xxl it fit like a small and no way would it be discrete also very thin cheap material so disappointed i am returning,0
sized small,1
they have a nice weight to them and do not feel cheap at all have not used them in the sun yet but they feel and look nice no complaints,2
i had a pair of these 20 years ago and they were the best boots so cool and fit great but i have wide feet and even though i ordered the wide size i just could never wear them for more than 15 minutes i would only buy these if you dont have wide feet now i have an expensive pair of boots i cant wear,0
if you wash this shirt or any from this company and they will peel i didnt even dry it in the dryer water peeled it right off sadly i purchased several from them so,0
perfect fit like the cut and the material the multi colors will match a variety of pants,2
this pants are a very awkward fit and are on the smaller end of 1012,1
it would be better if the sizes ran into smaller sizes with the amount of stretch,0
for a big and tall the pants had no room in the crotch they were so far up my butt i thought i was wearing a thong,0
this sweater fits great and is a soft material but smells terrible like chemicals i havent washed it but tried laundry spray and put it in the dryer which didnt help so i currently cant wear it i had it hanging for days and now will hang is outside to air out more,1
i love this bra i love everything about it the fit the feel the look but every good thing must have a downside i have bought multiple of these bras and each and everyone the underwire breaks and jabs into my skin if thr underwire was sturdier i would rate these much higher,1
great,2
these sunglasses are awesome stylish and comfortable theyre a great buy for a great price they were shipped and delivered very quickly everything is as described in descriptionbr br plastic framebr plastic lensbr polarizedbr lens width 47 millimetersbr lens width 47mm lens height 39mm frame 143mmbr lightweight durablebr 100 protection against harmful uvauvb raysbr elegant designbr i would definitely recommend them,2
simple cute,2
good size color is nice,2
not a bad shoe for the money i purchased them as a driving shoe they do run small i would order again but a size bigger,1
too baggy and to long,1
they are very nice nonpierced earrings you can set the size you need then they spring open so you dont have to screw them each time you want to wear them,2
these are very comfortable shoes theyre lightweight with thick spongy outer soles and replaceable inner soles the uppers are a breathable fabric the pulls on the heels are big enough to use they do run a bit large and the fit is a little loose so you might want to order a half size down,2
was too heavy and dropped down a lot,1
was great to wear to go greet my husbands brother who was returning from a mission in nebraska,2
i returned the first item because one of the snaps was defective unless you want to wear something underneath this item is suitable only for in house use on your own the wide spaces between the snaps will gap open when you move around and when you sit it is cool and okay for use as described,1
i really liked this jacket for my husband it is decent quality and fits nice however the belt is not fitted for the size of the jacket the belt is the exact same width as the jacket so even placing it on the first loop causes it to be very tight i have received some money back but that doesnt really solve the problem my husband just wears it without the belt but then the loops look funny oh well,1
this is a really cute little top to kick around in but order one size up i cannot wash and throw into the dryer because if it shrinks a little it will be too small,1
mid section is too small cant zip it,0
i would order a smaller size product has nice feel,1
finally found the perfect leggings and theyre yoga pants br soft and practical with the pocketseven holds my phone without pulling down the pants,2
with no tax or shipping so at five dollars its a good deal wish i could find leather belts with this military style buckle,2
you definitely need the curves to pull this one off curves in which i didnt have it fits my sister perfectly,2
there arent any choices for sizes like mens 13 they should be available,1
looks and feels cheap im a curvy hourglass and it was very unflattering i dont recommend it,0
i really dislike all the straps wish id gotten a single strap version,1
bought them for computer use at night not attractive but do the job,1
very very comfy great color super thin down side is they snag so so easy within the first day of wearing after a week about 30 of them is snaggedbr also fits small i usually a small medium and the large fit best,1
bought as a gift but was a little bit too sheer otherwise person happy,1
beautiful well made perfect fit dress im 5634 i fluxuate btwm137145 im a sz8 in dresses occasionally a 6 i ordered the medium after the lg the lg was too big overall but mainly in the bust waist the chinese medium was perfect its a us 6 basically in the tag wonderful quality too and the fabric is awesome such a steal,2
as seems to be the case with many inexpensive mens undergarments there is plenty to complain about but also enough goodness to make me keep using thembr br these socks fit reasonably well come to about the right height for ankle socks and have good breathability given that they are mostly cotton the color has also stayed true through numerous washingsi have had them for years and when i need to wear ankle socks they do the job well enoughbr br all those things said these are clearly cheaply made socks they are quite simply too thin there is no real padding to speak of and if you wear them constantly i imagine they would become threadbare pretty quickly i only wear them on occasion so i cannot say for certain in addition short ankle of the sock lacks very good elasticity becoming loose and drooping a bit on the legbr br if you are like me someone who only wears ankle socks on occasion then these are fine if you are someone who wear ankle socks regularly these should be passed over for something better,1
no me agradó que una pieza llegó quebrada,0
this is the second time my daughter bought this backpack its really cute and the perfect size for a teen to travel with lots of pockets and its well made we have the yellow and mint color great vibrant colors,2
the bracelet is too small and must be bent to get on the engraving is a surface print and i do not expect it to last very long with normal wear the metal band is heavy material so there is that,0
too tight,1
this was advertised as mens sizes but as soon as it goes into your cart it turns into boys sizes i only know this because i searched for the shirt again after i received it thinking it must have been my mistake but sure enough it said mens so i went to purchase it again luckily i noticed this time the bait and switch,0
does not have the chain closure detail shown in photo and fit is strange returning,0
i love this bracelet the chip bracelet has a nice cut and the stones are polished with a smooth feel i wish it would come in a couple sizes as this one barely fits on my small wrist i can live with that its a little loose but not too bad i have been wearing it everyday and its still in good condition,2
update 10202020br br ive discovered one of my cards is being damaged by taking it out of the wallet there are three card slots on the back side cards being taken out of the second center slot are being damaged over time the laminate of my bank card is starting to come up from removing the card over and over this is at the very edge of the card where you use your fingers to pull at the card its causing the strip you swipe to come off the plasticbr br i think part of the problem is that the card sits to far into the slot the top of the card rests almost on top of the slot this needs to be addressed i love the wallet but i cannot continue to use it i cant have it damaging my cardsbr br original reviewbr br i really love this wallet its so slim and holds money and cards perfectly i cant speak to the rfid blocking as i have no way to verify that it works and how well it works but this wallet is great and i would recommend it to everyone interested in getting a slim walletbr br you can put several cards into each slot if you need too and ive currently got quite a few 20s in the wallet and my drivers license and ccw in their along with business cards as well it can actually hold a lot more than it says and it has held up well,0
this soccer necklace made my sons day the necklace number is quite big which my son i loved but made it even special since he plays soccer he likes to keep it under his shirt because he know is mommys luck number i ordered the number 13 and really impressed with the quality the necklace is stainless steel and so far no allergic reaction to my sons overreacting skin type highly recommend,2
great look very thin sole worn them once i dont think they will last long if i wear them a lot,1
the sweatshirt was too short for my preference im 58,1
nice quality hoodie too bad it arrive with stinky sweat smells,1
too cheap of fabric,0
item is not authentic missing tie strings thinner fabric and different liner than true capezio products arrived without original capezio packaging shame on you amazon,0
waited for a while and got it it was a great product until it started to turn my wrist screen and started to discolor underneath the watch but great quality watch very well put together but only if they could change the fact that it turned your wrist green and has a bit of quality issues,1
not really comfortable ive had them maybe a month or so and the insoles are completely flat with no support,0
this shorts is good for the first use only and after i washed it in a cold water it did shrink and the pad is not big enough to fit the whole seat area,1
only downfall is its not a dark tint it actually shows in a bluish glare messes w sight a bit,2
nice but fit too tight,1
wide in chest very short good with tights or leggings,1
lacks a second window on the back of the license flip out viewer my badbr otherwise ok and soft like the stitchesbr ohpockets not consistent in size some cc and biz cards do not slide in smoothly in all pockets,1
cheaply made would only but it for a gag gift,1
small returning,1
i am not overly excited about these i will probably give them to grandchildren they are not my idea of what an adult wears for sunglasses i have only worn two of them a total of two times since i purchased them they dont provide the sunscreen protection that i need from sunglasses,1
i bought these light weight capris for an upcoming plane trip in a size medium normally i take a size 8 although they fit okay in the hips and legs the waist was very large from the picture it looks like these pants sit slightly below the waist which i prefer but while the back hit where it should the front was 45 inches below my navel very strange cut,1
it fit perfectly for me,2
got this to replace my turtle fur balaclava which i lost big mistake this thing is made of neoprene it is stiff and not comfortable in cold snowy weather the moisture freezes on it and it gets hard and icy i ended up buying another turtle fur,0
sorry but like what are these because they are not adult yoga pants they look like theyre made for children the material is not very stretchy and feels like sandpaper maybe ill use them to clean my floors or as a dish rag lol awful awful awful,0
i used mostly at work hat was small but neck warmer l liked,1
this looks nice but the stitching on the tie loop and bottom started coming loose within weeks,0
these never came i have written several requests for refunds or replacement to no avail this was a horrid experience,0
ok,1
while i did end up returning this shirt the weight and quality of it is definitely 4 stars this would have been a really great shirt but since im a curvy girl i just didnt find it flattering for my body style i have an hourglass figure with hips that are wide enough and the design of this just wasnt slimming it was more like a shapeless bag i think maybe if the material had a little more give to it it would hug my curves a little more but its a heavier fabric which i was surprised about and definitely liked so it was just a bit stiff i ordered it in two sizes true size and one larger both would have been perfect if they had a bit more give and i would have gone with the larger one because of the length,1
material is junk,0
such a good quality super soft and comfortable,2
loved by my teenagebr classic stylebr fun and affordablebr no regrets,2
the color matches the photo and the fabric of the kimono is nice my husband said its very comfortable to wear i recommend ordering a size or two up if you order it my husband is normally a lxl and i ordered it in a size 2x which fits nicely to give it that flowy look my biggest problem with this item is that it came with a couple holes in the stitching like the one pictured i was very disappointed in that being that he hadnt even worn it yet this shows that it isnt very high quality if its falling apart before it even arrives overall with the stitching and sizing im not sure if it was a worth it purchase,0
good waist trimmer for the price but the wires in the back of corset starts to poke you in your lower back after wearing it for a while stays in place as your working out or walking definitely makes your stomach sweat too which like and it keeps your posture upright when your sitting helps with back pain too,1
the foot is able to slide the straps provide no support,1
i wear a 105 depending on shoe i ordered a 10 an 11 would have been too big i have a desk job so these will be fine to wear to work however i left work and stop by a store and after walking around for 30 mins my toes hurt my feet are not wide but are not narrow either hope this helps with purchase decision nice looking shoes and good quality,1
great assortment of charms none were the same my kids loved it unfortunately the bracelets didnt come with the pieces although the discription stated bracelets with the charms recommend this product packaged in a plastic sealed bag,2
bottoms made small,0
excellent style and fit feels like wearing swim trunks love them,2
i received sooo many compliments on this band it was too big but thankfully it came with the tool to remove links no complaints great buy i will def purchase other colors,2
this has become my favorite shirt the fit is perfect it shows off my curves without hugging them tightly the material is soft and the cut is flawless i am a size 14 and the large fits like it was tailored to me i will definitely be buying this in more colors,2
i bought these shoes for my son for christmas and after the second time he wore them the blue light and dark lights on one of the shoes stopped working its highly disappointing they now just sit there because he gets frustrated everytime he thinks about wearing them,0
my teen age daughter loves it definitely not a piece of quality but for costume jewelry it is great,2
cute top but it was big i read others reviews and ordered a size up and am really disappointed that i did because now i have to return it it is a really cute top otherwise,1
the perfect size and i believe the material is exactly what it says it is im using them in my earlobes because im extremely sensitive to all metals now including sterling silver i have been wearing these for a couple of good weeks now at least and so far no itching or anything theyre also super cute,2
i like this watch band very much it is comfortable and attractive but what attracted me to it was the way it looked with the matching watch face the product description said that one could ask how to download the watch face i asked in the question section above and was told in an email from amazon customer service that i probably would not get an answer from the seller so as much as i like the band i am very disappointed that i cant purchase te watch face,1
this is way too small the sizes need to be adjusted if this product is going to be sold online saying that it 34runs small34 is too vague to be helpful even after sizing up this hat was still too small,0
fits true to size i wear a slip underneath to smooth out my foldsbr a little narrow at the bottom it forces me to take smaller steps,2
love the heavier weight of this shirt fits good well made happy with this purchase,2
mask fits pretty tightly around the ears of a 12yo but is workable fits better than an adult sized mask would probably is better for kids up to age 11 the picture of the extender fitted around a thin white string is misleading there is no way the floppy rubber extender will stay on the thick black elastic ear loops of these masks tie dye designs are cool very vibrant,1
way too small,0
se desgastó muy rápido,1
i wanted to love these and in some ways i do the parts that fit properly are so soft like a second skin if the whole shoe felt that way id live in them however the fit is all off perhaps because they are trying to make a unisex shoe and honestly that just isnt going to work for most feet men and women on average have different shaped feet our gaits are different as is our center of gravity politics aside when it comes to the biology of feet nature really doesnt care about anyones desire for a unisex world i use to wear skater shoes back in the 90s when it was edgy for girls to do so i loved them but i was also painfully aware they didnt really fit right either and id wear thick socks i still did look pretty cool at 19 in my airwalks just sayin but i dreaded the truck across campus on hot daysbr br with womens feet being more tapered and mens wider overall unless we are talking flip flops or maybe some slides unisex sizing is going to be a fail these shoes were no exception they fit all weird like i had a solid inch past my toes and im always a size 6 the length was basically a 7 the footbed was a little bit too wide but not a whole size too wide i could have lived with it but the rest of the shoe fit like a second skin so sizing down would have made that part too smallbr br i could have lived with the fit issues but the sole makes them unwearable there is an oddity to how the nubs in the sole under just your big toe are much harder than the rest of the nubs on the bottom of the shoe its as if all the other nubs have some give but the ones under your big toe are solid rocks like your toe is sitting on a piece of concrete and the rest of the shoe is padded it feels too weird and unnatural to walk that waybr br i see potential in these shoes but they feel like a prototype and not a finished product,1
good hiking sneaker but it seemed to run a bit small my kid grew out of it before his other sneakers of the same size,1
the shoes are very cute but the side of the shoe is a bit too high and cut into my ankle bone cute shoes are not worth pain so unfortunately they had to go back i would give 5 stars for style but the cut of the shoe reduces it to 1 star so i gave it 3 stars,1
shirt runs small,1
great durable showruns about half a size bigger,2
this wallet is stiff and does not appear to be real leather it is also so small you cannot put much in it very tight i returned it,0
fits and a good work out shirt,2
too small for me,1
just what i wanted easy to install would buy again and a quick delivery,2
not at all the vibrant colors depicted in the picture the lime is more of an olive not true to size its extremely roomy nice material seemed to be well made it was returned and i never wore it,1
works just like originals,2
cute bracelet but its a little lower quality than i expected,1
this is really pretty but the clasp doesnt stay closed and it has fallen off several times,1
the fit is perfect the zipper is cheap and i have to cut threads after every washing now after three wearings the zipper is separating from the dress at the bottom if this dress lasts the summer in one piece i will be surprised but i do look good in itlol,1
perfect fit for my husband,2
cant take links out why though,0
the tshirt has stretch i sized up two sizes and ran small i can usually wear a large or xl i ordered a xxl as amazon tshirts usually run small and it fits like a large also i thought the the lightening bolt was sequins and its not,0
nice dress,2
like it,2
after one wash and dry the leggings had lint all over very bad quality,0
junk color fading broken,0
no irritation comfortable and lightweight great symmetrical design vibrant glistening opal glow,2
adorable charm arrived quickly after 1 month the charm is slightly tarnished still looks good though,2
i was really excited to order this but it really disappointed me it feels like a semi stretchy cheap shower curtain and its beyond oversized i looked so stupid in this,0
they were cute as first after moving around with them for two hours they became very loose and baggy,0
not good quality returned it,0
i bought these to wear under a short skirt for a st patricks day parade they will work fine for that but doubt i will wear them otherwise they fit as expected size xl except for my butt theyre a little low in the back because im frankly bottom heavy they are a little seethrough can see my underwear but since ill be wearing a skirt also im not concerned about that,1
i wear a womens size 7 12 and these are too loose they are excellent quality and very comfortable however,1
very cheap poor quality and material is rubbish for the price,0
great materials better than i thought it would be,2
good product i recommend,2
beautiful shades love the shape and fit well disappointed on second fitting the nose piece uneven so they dont fit correctly,0
i feel like this ran very big my daughter is in 6 so i ordered 67 and it was huge on her,1
since my daughter is starting to walk in the summer months i decided to not get the traditional white bootstyle walking shoe it wasnt easy finding something with ankle support in a sandal but this brand had a lot to choose from my only complaint is that they seem to run a little big my daughters keds sneakers are a size 4 so i got a size 4 and they are too big in the length and too big around the ankle i tried to verify that the shoes i got were really a 4 and they are not marked inside the shoe oh well she will grow into them,2
upon receiving the panties i thought they were ok washed them then tried them on great fit feels good and looks great pricy 1799 is a bit much for 7 basic pair of panties i would definitely look for cheaper pricebr br the following day or two i get an email from the seller they asked if i received them and if they were as expected they also asked what they can do to provide a better experience of course i always have an opinion and provided it their response was not only welcoming but received well understanding and appreciative their customer service is more impressive than the panties which will keep me coming back and recommending them will be buying more and definitely from this seller,1
bought for my daughter that loves cow print unfortunately you can see her underwear because the material is so thin bummed that these can only be wore as jammies,0
it is not as pictured the material is very stiff cotton,0
slippers are well constructed and comfortable the lower stars are because the straps are a lot shorter than expected my motherinlaws feet are very swollen and i was hoping the velcro straps would give her the flexibility needed they really need longer flaps on top if they are going to advertise these for people with edema,1
it came sooner than expected which was a pleasant surprise however it was nowhere near as roomy as pictured and arrived with four small holes i decided to use it as a nightgown,0
came as promised looks ok not great quality but super cute color combos we did not receive a tie which is a bummer because this was for a dress up day at school,0
good,1
nice fit but small,1
as described,2
love it it holds up to everything i put to it wish it was in a gold or silver color,2
well thats what i get for trying knockoffs these are stiff and cheap and arent even pink mirrored they look really ugly when on your face people taking the photos did them at angles where you cant tell that they are super flat and look really awkwardbr br bummer i wanted to get more colors but these are so bad i cant even find a way to like them i tried,0
these are great my son loves them he doesnt normally like wearing socks but he will put these on with no complaints and actually likes to see whats printed on them i like that he doesnt slip and fall on my hardwood floors not too thick or thin and fit is good he wears a size 10 little kids shoe,2
my husband loves this as a person with bi polar and borderline personality disorder we like to make it less stressful buy having items like these,2
these run a little tight i was able to stretch them a bit to at least make them wearable,1
beautiful watch fair price the only issue is the straps are little short if you have a big wrist this watch is not for you,1
kinda big and bulky larger than i expected its also heavybr i had a similar one of a different brand i liked it better because it wasnt so big,1
bad quality,0
unfortunately i am returning them,0
this dress was not the beautiful color pictured it was a dull bluepurple it was shipped rolled in a bag cheap is the best i can say i never even tried it on unacceptable beware this seller told me three times my money was refunded i never got it as a matter of fact i had to prove by usps i had returned the ugly dress i finally had to report him to amazon amazon gave me a full refund beware this seller is not professional and will cheat you,0
the part where the design is was peeling off after the 3rd day of wearing them,0
i selected my correct size with most other products and this product was way too big for methis product does not run true to size and i felt like it was cheaply made i had issues with getting a full refund from this company so i just said forget it and counted it as a loss,0
super long,1
it is special for autumn or spring when is windy,2
my favorite running shoes these shoes have it all for someone with strong high arches they are cushioned enough to protect my body from too much shock yet sturdy enough to provide stability to my runs i have several pairs of running shoes that i rotate through but these are by far my favorite especially for low light runs the reflectors are very helpful,2
first off it was hard to see the actual coloring from the pic but the shirt i received had gray bands around the armpit areas which i do not like second while the picture looks fitted the actual shirt is very 34barrelshaped34 so for my midsection it is far too bulky i would have to get at least a size smaller but then the sleeves would be too shortbr br its hard to buy cloths and shoes sight unseen overall its a nicelooking shirt but i will likely not wear it due to the sizing and if i were to sweat i imagine it would show immediately with the grey material,1
beautiful dress,2
so i thought the dress that i ordered was more of a wine color but it ended up being red bright red so this set was more suited for a wine or burgundy colored outfit so i had to return everything was fine but the earrings did seem to be pretty cheap looking,0
my son and his wife just purchased their first home i wanted to pick them up a little something to show them how special that is these matching keychains are super cute the engraving is well done and easy to read although there is a heart on it its not so overwhelming to make my son shy about using it its just a little gift to serve as a daily reminder,2
the socks worked well the 1st time i wore them however after washing them once i can only take a few steps before they slip off my heel save your money buy another brand,0
i thought they would be bigger they are extremely small probably gonna give them away,1
videoidac74d7e0d4b937e5a63f653040236c0a these nose rings surprised me by how nice they were for the price im very happy my nose hasnt turned green i love the opal one obviously its not real but it looks great and matches my other piercing jewelry they are easy for me to open and put in and take out im glad i took a shot and actually got what i was expecting,2
ive ordered and received saucony 105 shoes in the past ive worn only saucony running shoes for many years these 105 are much longer and wider than any ive ever had before i double checked the size on the shoe to see if i possibly was sent a wide but no i am stymied and not pleased with this sizing i will wear these with double socks when im working in my house,0
i got it for my husband and he loves it to carry his apt book for his customers it is a nice size for a 6434 tall guy,2
the fit is quite tight and not really ample in the buttocks area,1
this is the cutest little wallet it was exactly what i was looking for i wanted something i could carry into the store without having to tote my whole purse the only thing i could think of as a con is the number of spaces for your debitcredit cards this is not going to hold all of those random cards you collect this is perfect for those most used items and your id i will also add the id pocket allows easy access if you need to remove it some wallets hold it hostage and are very difficult to slide the id out i love my wallet i get lots of compliments on it as well very happy with this purchase,2
ordered size us medium got large luckily this time the product quality is better last time the t shirted were very poor quality,1
i have never had a pair of asics that i didnt enjoy wearing and these are no exception i bought them specifically for my treadmill workouts but they will be excellent for walking anywhere,2
havent worn the gloves yet initial impressions these things have a very strong odor it does seem to be dissipating i will give them a couple of days for the odor to leave before sending them backbr odor dissipated wore them in 40 f weather 10 mph wind passed through them my fingers were cold these would not hold up to the low temperatures advertised,1
super warm super stylish,2
this shirt overwhelmed me and i gave it away there is a lot of fabric and sizing runs large very cute tho i would have loved it if it was a bit smaller,1
these were perfect in looks however they fell apart as i took them out of the bag i am returning them today,0
these are cute but the quality isnt great,1
the chain was very weak and broke the first time i put it on,1
great bag to consolidate all your belongings the option to remove the shoulder strap is a great touch plenty of room in the bag and good amount of pocket space,2
only received one earring and the one i did get was just thrown in the box so the tassels were not laying flat i do not recommend,0
too short,0
overall the quality seemed good and i loved the color i sent it back because it wasnt comfy i should have ordered a size up because i like my workout takes baggier,1
arms a little off body and fit were correct,1
i measure at a 34 band but would have needed a 36 in this bra the cups were a total nogo as well i even ordered up a size just in case knowing this was a s tight garment there is no way i can wear this so its going back i might consider getting another but id have no idea where to start with size,0
this came right on time and it was exactly what i was looking for,2
my husband loves it,2
this item compared to others in the same size runs very small,1
i gave them to my sister since they are too big for me but super comfortable too bad,1
very nice and looks good on my feet,2
made this purchase because the item looked very cute but it was very small fell apart before wearing i will not be ordering again not even worth it to return also it takes forever to receive,0
this is a beautiful watch the blue leather strap is really highquality leather and it fits my husband perfectly it runs smooth and is accurate i think this is the kind of watch you wear to play in although he has worn it to work and it help up just fine he really doesnt like wearing watches but for some reason he really likes this one and he wears it most of the time it just looks so good on him i love it too the price is definitely a steal,2
i love the color softness great for grandchild with sensory challenges yet sleeves are long it is not a problem as then the sleeves do not ride up far because youchild can hold them,2
it was very poor quality the charms were constantly falling off,0
beautiful bracelets but i made jewelry and i felt like i couldve made something like this i wanted something a little different it would probably be perfect for a different person the stone is very pretty it is a wrap bracelet i returned it because i was concerned about how durable it would be,1
after gaining some weight my old bras even with extenders were feeling tight so i decided to size up these are very comfortable with the wide band which was what i was looking for ended up getting two more,2
looks great smooth movement and feels hefty and manly on your wrist,2
very small but good brand style and design looks good just too small for a man,1
flimsy material i returned it,0
i had purchased the tydye color of the same style and its georgeous but this one with butterflies not good,0
i have many pairs of crocs but something about this particular pair causes the bottoms of my feet to itch after i wear them for a while this makes me sad because they are so comfortable otherwise,1
surprise me beautiful,2
very nice watch recommended,2
holding up well to an industrial setting where im constantly digging or using my keys i expect them to hold up well even left some at my work to organize and upgrade some of the shop keys,2
i had these shoes for a month and the fabric is torn by my heel this is my 4th pair of brooks running shoes and i am disappointed in the quality of this pair my other pairs were in great shape after a year but these hardly lasted a month,0
good pants just very short and there is no chance to fix the problem decause the stile,1
this was too large for my teen daughter,1
we had an embroidery name put on it for our granddaughter it is beautiful,2
love this suit perfect for my girls beach weekend,2

for reference i am 53 and 116lbsthis sweater tagged as one size for all is comfortable but by no means loose on me the material is both thick and very stretchy and form fittingi even feel a little self conscious at times wearing this as such i love the sweater it is thick and warm washes well with no pilling and holds its shape my favorite aspect of this sweater is the turtleneck it isnt overly tight yet stands well and holds its shape there is no tag in the back of the sweater which makes it a little hard to know which end is frontbut having tried wearing it both waysit doesnt seem to matter this sweater is polished and classic i have ordered two more in black and white i wish they would offer more colors,2
it is cute but ripped where the card slots are it did not even make it 2 months,0
i was so excited for this dress it took so long to come and when it came i was disappointed its very big so order a size down also the sleeves were very odd and puffybr br i returned my dress last week still havent gotten my refund,0
nice cropped jacket true to size well sewn but sleeves are a little long i have to cuff them about them about four inches but i guess better longer than shorter to hem yourself,2
i really love the hat but its small for my son hes 17 months old i got 624 months size its more like 612 months so i got him 2t4t size probably it will be 1824 mowell see if its for perfectly,1
fit is good but quality could be better fabric is on the thin sidebr and stitching has missed spots better off with hanes,1
snag on every thing pulls like a fiber out looks worn out after 1 day on blue black ones cant see i guess,0
i was supposed to get a youth large and received an adult large amazon was great and refunded my money the tshirt wasnt bad pretty thin material,1
this fiyote women plus size strapped one piecebikini swimwear swimsuit design is everything but the fit of the top is all wrong its molded cup design did not work for my plus size boobies 42 dd the bottoms worked just fine i had to return this item,1
i bought this for my husband and he really likes it,2
a little small for mebut very comphie,1
not as expected runs too big,1
too small and its my usual size from koi the design is very odd the construction is unattractive and not what i was expecting if i had seen it in person i would never have bought it,1
very nice and very see through,1
46 inches too samall0,0
turns after awhile,1
absolutely love these leggins the high waist in made of a really wide elastic band that holds everything in up since the waistband stays put the leggings dont ride up and create any unwanted exposure they are thinner than my lululemons but still opaque and thick enough not to show any panty lines they are soft and look high quality at least the purple ones do perfect for the summer and workouts definitely buying more in different colors,2
fit is larger than i expected but the shirt is soft and absorbent when working out,1
this is a very nice ring love the price too,2
this material is pretty weird its very stretchy its almost like a bad spandex polyester blend i am keeping the dress though mostly because i need it and i dont care that much about how i look its just a maternity dress i wouldnt buy it again,1
material was horrible and very polyester looking shiny and sticky,0
love and hate this bra it is a great fit but the lace is bulky and shows through shirts i dont like when bras have the seam down the middle of the boob,1
runs big has a chemical odor which is offensive and pics are deceiving as it looks like 3 parts which can be removed not the case its 1 piece,1
thin fabric loose unflattering fit,0
color ran after one wash,0
i read reviews saying that these boots smelled but oh my goodness the smell was so overwhelming my kid or anyone else in the house couldnt get past the smell to even try them on,0
update after wearing the dress the first time i noticed imperfections in the fabric thin lines like runners in pantyhose material i was afraid it would snag and spread so i opted to return the dress such a shamebr br for reference im normally a size 14 pear shaped 383446 the xl fits me perfectly keep in mind this dress is a polyester spandex blend so while it does stretch alot it also hugs and will not hide imperfections so if youve got some rolls or dimples you want to hide youll want to wear a slip or shapewear with this dress i love that this dress stretches so well i dont even have to bother with the zipper just pull it over my head now if i wanted a form fitted look i probably could have sized down to a large without busting out of the dress but because im not a tiny girl i opted for the xl comfortable fit the chest and armholes arent too snug and the length is a couple inches below the knee on me im 5 foot tall i would buy this dress in other prints the color of the navy with white flowers that i got is just as expected from the picture the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because the quality of material doesnt seem like it will hold up well to washing or last long and the material also will tend to get warm not breathe well,1
not high quality leather you get what you paid for,0
this wallet is very cute and exactly what i was looking for style wise with the cute owls fyi the money part of the wallet does not fit bills and there is no zipped coin pouch for loose change i have to fold the bills in half to make them fit in the zipped cash part just a heads up if you always carry cash and coins i will most likely use it as a spare,1
a lovely ring but not sterling silver as stated why go on about stamping it and it being sterling silver when it does not have a stamp and smells like cheap metal nice costume jewelry very disappointed as i got it to give a friend for her birthday,0
the colors faded to almost nothing after one wash,0
the tie is extra long but the color is off it doesnt look like the picture the picture is more browngold when you get it youll barely see this also the texture of the tie is not silky soft its actually kind of rough either way cant beat the price,1
order my size but is just small,1
love these shoes ordered a toddler size 6w and they fit great i love the double velcro to keep the shoe on and the colors are fantastic definitely recommend,2
these are regular size folks maybe they are xl in china where there were made,1
didnt like quality of fabric its too thin,0
love this bag,2
its a big green bag the insert is absolutely ridiculous threw it out the second i unpacked it totally unnecessary and not at all helpful having said that sans insert its a good bag sturdy and nice bigthats about it,1
not a bad apron but ive had better very stiff and course strings are not very long i guess it does the job tho,1
bought large went by chart and reviews but it was smaller shorter than i wanted will be returning im 160lbs 54 i though i was buying tanks thats cover my rear and wear under sweaters hits at top of hips like a normal tank would,1
shrink 2 sizes when washed,0
im 52 and wear a size 8 they are stretchy but lose the design if stretched too much not too ridiculously long however i have a butt and these have a low rise to them so the backside sat right on the separation of cheeks portion bending over would definitely have me in the stereotypical plumbers club i wore these for about 15 minutes until they drove me too crazy and i had to take them off,1
not work,0
beautiful bracelet but the strings hang too long and cant do anything with them,0
these are see through too short and they do not stay up i bought these according to other leggings sizes and the size chart they fit however even the slightest squat makes them see through if you are tall or have curves spend your money elsewhere,1
i love the fact the scarves come prewrapped and comfortable,2
didnt realize faces would be so yellow one watch came cracked contacted company but since they came from china and were so cheap i really dont expect any reimbursement or replacementbr overall a nice item for a decent pricebr came with batteries which i didnt expect,1
i love my previous pair of ugg boots theres no doubt so i wanted to add another pair i purchased these and am disappointed with the seams inside the back part of upper heel for this reason it makes me very sad,1
this product is fine but i lost the colored stone out of it in two days have not tried the other ones yet,1
the shape size and darkness of the lenses are okay but be aware that the actual width of these are not as advertised i measure them at 131mm and they are advertised at 135mm i didnt bother to measure them or even try them on before i needed them and was disappointed to see bright light at the outer edges unfortunately there arent any others that are advertised as wide so i may have to make these work but im going to shop around a bit before deciding that,0
this jacket ended up not being what i expected the fit is very off and it looks more like a lab coat than a blazer recommend sizing down if you order this,1
literally fits like a glove but i recommend it for people with hands on the more petite side like baby hands basically,2
what a lie not silk just trash,0
perfect solution to wanting existing ceiling fans to be smart and controlled by alexa it even works with our gas fireplace insert the fans are upstairs and the fireplace is downstairs and it controls all of them just fine,2
im 511 300lbs w a little gut i usually get 4xl however after reading some of the reviews of how this item runs big decided to go a size down to 3xl i like my tops to be a little snug but not too tight im glad i did go down in size this item even being a 3xl was still a little baggy and big im going to wash it to shrink it down a little other than the size the product is great its a heavier fabric which is nice to wear on cooler days without you getting too hot either item runs big i would go down a size for sure,2
i like the fabric too,2
i waited too long to open and use this product and wish i hadnt i have small feet and the socks are way too thin small and flimsy dont buy,0
wouldnt have been a bad belt if it didnt crack and have the exterior material peeling and flaking off within a year of purchase looked good while it was still intact but isnt worth buying again considering how long it lasts i bought a canvas military style belt instead for my next vegan beltmay not be as dressy but im sure it will last a lot longer,0
this dress just didnt fit as expected the pattern from the top to bottom also didnt match up sent back,0
hat is not for an adult head like the hat but too small,1
i like the rache but the belt buckle doesnt lack too well some time it comes off from the belt,1
good quality hat very pleased,2
returned was broken in several pieces and didnt get a single wear out of it,0
it beeps on the hour 24 hours a day even after following the instructions on the qa there is no way to turn the watch off so short of running it over or flushing it down the toilet you are in for an eternity of incessant night time awakenings,0
i ordered these in space grey and black and am returning both they are too thin to remain opaque or provide any compression you can see my skin tone through both im 56 and 150lb and i ordered mediums,1
took a chance with the little reviews had a hard time staying up on my face also a little thinner than expected,1
i like the look but not the engraving of the brand name on the lens,1
nice tshirt if you ware a large order an extra large the womens large fits like a medium to small the arms are tight and the material looks as if it will shrink in the wash its a lot of trouble to deal with at the high cost of this simple tshirt not worth the 32 but it was a gift and theres no returning it now will not buy from this company online again will search out what i want in person at a store in the future not the sellers fault but truly beware on what size you choose in a womens tshirt these are made for smaller people,1
to flip open the watch was extremely difficult for an adult so way to difficult for a child had to be pried open with a knife would not recommend this besides that the lights in front worked but the buttons to set the time were difficult to press and actually work,0
i love the color green im fortunate that it goes well with my coloring i also like for my snoodstichels to match my clothing somewhat i originally bought a different color and design by this company so i knew what to expect the tichel i first bought is elegant and the fabric hangs longer than this one but since i wear this one for everyday the fact that its a bit shorter is a benefit i dont have to worry about it getting caught by anything or accidentally getting it wet when im washing my handsbr br the fabric is not only attractive its a good strong weave its so well made that im not concerned about putting it in the washing machine and dryer im very pleased with it,2
i love it but they dont wash very well i feel likebr theyre only good for 68 months they get verylinty and not as pristine as id hoped does anybody have tips on how to make socks last long,1
im using it for a decoration for feb not to wear so as a decoration its great,2
poor quality returned,0
very nice the chain started to fade after about 2 weeks but the text seems to stay gold i never showered with it,1
although these earrings appear to be well made and come in a nice velvet bag they are so thin that you really cannot see the variance in colors from the website youd think the colors are pretty distinct and easily defined but that is not the case and they really appear more as a gold hoop than tricolor,0
excellent,2
excelent,2
oh my god nice very comfortable we will need very soft,2
i dont like that the leggings fall down and im not buying a garter belt,0
these did not work from the very first day that i got them i took them to a place that sells all kinds of batteries and the guy sold me the batteries that go into the earrings cost me 976 as the earrings took 2 batteries in each earring i installed the earrings according to the video i got off of the computer and the earrings still did not work i am now in the process of trying to reach collections etc by phone i have been trying for the last 10 min and have receive nothing but a recording so i have sent an email we will see how that goes i do not want my money back i would like an exchange,0
too big for size but still really comfortable,1
fantastic product these socks are very sturdy and have just the right amount of padding they are stand all day comfortable,2
cheaply made clasp broke the first week i had it,0
it was very odd but some fit perfect some were too small very odd,1
no way to adjust the band feels very cheap and its fading in some parts,0
i love this dress it is very comfortable and i get compliments each time i wear it,2
got a size medium for my bf they ended up being at least an xlgave them to someone else,0
finally a sports bra that fits larger breasts with separation and support first one ive found that i didnt end up with a smashed uniboob yes it is a bit difficult to get on and off and if you dont have good flexibility in your arms this might not be for you once you get the hang of it its a really comfortable sports brabr br update i liked this bra so much i bought another one unfortunately the underwire has already poked through through the fabric completely i feel it should have lasted longer than a couple months with only occasional wear,1
nice color but were way too long not capri pants went past my grandmas shoes,0
good quality of fabric and construction but can not rely on website descriptions of colors and sizes i ordered size small long sleeve which fitted my husband well but this one is so tight the color is different from the website why does carrhart post the measurements chest length for each size on amazon,1
the white bottom looked like the orange bled onto it wasnt really white,1
i had ordered a pair from a warehouse deal and loved them they were so comfortable they felt better than a pair of ariat boots but the boots from the warehouse deal had a broken boot pull on 1 boot so i thought i would order another pair to have to wear when i go out somewhere as you can see what i got was damaged and looked worse than the pair from the warehouse deal they had been scribbled on with a ink pen and had bad scratches all over both boots the inside material was real loose and wrinkled up inside 1 boot im female and wear a size 95 to a 10 in womens and got the 85 wide i size 8 would have probably been ok but i like to wear wool socks to keep my feet from sweating these are not made with the same full grain thicksmooth leather that they were a few years ago like some of the older reviews photo show so like others if you have a pair of the older boots these are not the same if thats what your looking for this feels like a cheaper feeling leather this type of leather feels like it will stretch after a little wear anyway returned due to damage,0
love the style and fit but the right lens pops out very easily,1
does not look anything like this it is a very miniature scale in a very rose colored metal as well was not happy with this item at all,0
very comfy for all day just makes me feet sweat a lil in the summer,2
great socks i never dry in dryer and they lasted almost a year for this teenager a must buy,2
sandal width is a little wide i have a narrow foot so wish it came in different widths,1
nice bracelet could be a little bigger though,2
iron seriously these shirts arrived a wrinkled mess and they are put together like scrubs note to manufacturer this is the 21st century nobody has time to iron anymorebr better quality at walmart folks,0
item was as described would certainly purchase again if needed,2
the problem is really nice its comfortable and stretchy breeze theres only one downfall and im updating this from the last one that i said about this bra the padding they have inside of it its really strange i dont like it halfway on both sides of your breasts which is really strange it should be a lot longer covering the whole breast however this change would make it a perfect bra its odd feeling that the padding is so short in coverage its like its make for a smaller size,2
if the strap was stretchier it would be good then i could get them on and off without messing with the buckle or if it didnt have such an oldfashioned difficult buckle velcro would be nice if you want to buckle and unbuckle them every time you wear them they would be ok,0
heavy fabric though it is synthetic shirt hangs on the arms oddly,1
very thin and doesnt stay up,0
fits great and im a small frame photographer easy and simple,2
yep,2
a little snug but i love the material,1
it was perfect,2
nice shirt good wicking ability,2
the fabric is very cheap,0
i liked this tote i really liked the butterfly print i also like that it is recycledbr br we love vera bradley we have been getting products from them for years and are always happy they just have great qualitybr this is a very nice bag the quality seemed very good everything worked fine on it without a problem it seemed to be durable we have used it without a problem it opens and shuts just fine it seems to be a decent thickness everything in it stays just finebr it is pretty comfortable to carry it doesnt feel too bulky it can hold a decent amount it looks pretty good on i like the extra features of it it is also pretty attractive it looks nice i would recommend it,2
the heel area is padded nicely but my heel slip sideways because there isnt any support to keep heel centered so i sent it back,1
looks nice but definitely did not fit my michael kors bradshaw access watch like it advertises,1
wish i had searched more,0
i like everything about it,2
unable to return because of gift purchase and date to return is expired,0
fit nice but material is very thin,1
i didnt like the look when i saw them physically so i sent back,1
material too thin,0
simple but classy,2
these are adorable will definitely buy more,2
i found this top super comfortable to wear breathable and i can layer it if i need to stay warmer i ordered the lilac quarterzip and the color is beautiful i am 52 130 lbs and the medium fits great even if i want to wear long sleeve shirts underneath cant get any better quality and fit for the price,2
way too small band size i cant say anything about just as it wasnt fitting the shoulder straps are granny like too not something youd feel sexy in or at least i wouldnt,0
run large,1
this sticker is perfect for my car i know its not centered my son hit my hand as i was placing it and it stuck may order a new one and redo its perfect size to be seen and looks great go army hooah,2
its was decent quality im a dd and an xl didnt fit my boobs and the bottoms were too small as well and i wear size 10 pants,1
the heating elements are way too hot and i had to unplug them fairly quickly they are very uncomfortable for the hands and may work better for small hands the gloves shed so much that my house has fuzz all around it they are soft and fit well though so i use them without the heating elements,0
so after over a decade of having my pair of skechers that i loved and wished i could have found an exact replacement of i decided to go with these honestly not that impressed originally bought an 11 because thats what i typically buy but they didnt feel right ended up ordering a 12 as well and they feel more right to me than the 11 did they could actually be true to fit and im just weird but id definitely suggest going up a size theyll do but im fairly positive they wont last anywhere near as long as my previous pair did,1
the girls loved their belly rings,2
i have had baggallini bags before they are the best bags they take a beating and keep on ticking you can wash them too the last one lasted 10 years of heavy and abusive use only reason i had to part with it was the handle hook up broke so i finally let it go but the bag itself was in perfect condition so got this one with all of the pockets i will ever need great bag buy it you will not be sorry,2
for 12 this was a great deal i got these for my fiance since he needed new shoes for softball hes normally an 11 but can sometimes fit into a 105 they are a little tight but do fit,2
im 52 and 108 lbs these fit a little too big and were not flattering the length was okay and the color was nice which were the only positives,0
good buy for price a little smaller than chart says,1
i weigh 149 and small is too big for me i look like preggy not flattering,1
got a sun instead of the turtle,1
broke super easily did not last,1
its a nice dress good color combination i just did not liked the fabric its a thin polyester,1
these fit small for the large size that was ordered i have bought swim shorts like these in the past and large fit better on those styles,1
this is a very nicely designed and constructed umbrella it appears that premium materials are used in the construction heavy duty treated fabric and powder coated metal pole and partsbr br the umbrella arrived undamaged in a huge box and comes assembled you only need to attached the decorative collar and umbrella to the base using the provided hex bolts and hex key tool 5 minutes max youll definitely need to weigh down the base you could use sandbags or blocks but i suggest buying the abba base weights which are specially designed to fit the base see my review elsewhere for the weightsbr br deployingstowing the umbrella is easy using the crank handle tilting is again easily achieved by unlockingsliding the tilt handle up and down the polebr br the only disadvantage is getting the supplied cover onoff the umbrella is so tall youll have to use a stepladder unless youre andré the giant,2
cute shirt fits as expected,1
great for the price but definately get your usual size or downsize by one very large legs,2
very cheap quality not worth the money,0
very nice and it was a great gift idea the neck strap will adjust for anyone with any size frame or neck,2
i do not like it you cant even read what it says very disappointed,0
very cute and pretty colorcoral but the sleeves were much too big and loose while the waist was super tight it did not give me a good look at all quite weird looking on me unless you are quite skinny through the mid section dont bother trying to get a good fit with this shirt even if it fits great through the waist the sleeves will be very baggy looking,1
it has good well wide for round face sunscreen i like,2
good belts for light duty use and they dont trigger metal detectors in secure facilities the one bad thing about them is the fraying elastic belt loop keep,0
these do not do what you expect them to do the butt area is not sewed correctly to lift the butt the one star is because they are comfortable and not see through at all i will wear these only in my home gym because they look like a worm hole and i do have a butt and these pants make me look like i dont,0
fits rather big,1
awful these used to be good quality but now i cannot afford to throw my money away do not buy,0
womens blouse was very thin amp way too small i ordered a very large top amp when it arrived i was so disappointed bcuz to would only fit a young girl,0
i just received these yesterday and theyre awesome my husband recently got me expensive diamond earrings but the backs were terrible i was so afraid id lose an earring so i purchased these these backs snap on nice and tight and require a good amount of strength to get them off but not too much that theyre difficult to remove i definitely recommend them,2
bad material,0
i used htv to add my name on to mine and they look great on my suitcases due to covid all our trips have been cancelled but they seem sturdy and well made i am excited to get to actually use them one day,2
warm quality and comfortable,2
these leggings fit a little smaller than i would like but im still able to wear them i am not sure what it said the size fit up to but im a 22 and its snug and doesnt pull up over my tummy like i usually like my leggings to do however with a long top youd never notice an issue plus theyre super cute and worth them not being a perfect fit,2
returned i didnt like the fabric and it was larger than expected,1
it fits much better on the mi smart 6 then the mi smart 5 it fits on 5 but its very loose however on the 6 fits perfectly,2
didnt realize it was going to be huge so be sure to look at the demensions,2
love it thank you,2
these are not as cute in person i dont think and they definitely run big at least half a size too big maybe a full size they seem like they are for a wider foot too i ordered my regular size and tried them on with just a little cotton footie and i was sliding all over the place cant imagine what it would be like with nylonsbr br if i had liked the look of them more i would have reordered a size down but i just didnt like them as much in person,0
in comparison to sketchers go walk this bubbles are hard like stones i thought its soft rubber balls like sketchers go walk i was going to give negative review because the balls are very hard but after trying it i was like omg i feel like im walking on coil suspensions dbr i have already kswiss timberland puma nike but sorry this shoes has different technology dont ever hesitate to buy this shoes its a machine not just a shoe i wear eur 44 but i bought eur 445 and its just fitting so buy 12 size bigger only if you will buy 1 size bigger it will be like a boat in your legs d,2
purchased this watch in april 2015 and within a week the second hand had fallen off and was laying at the bottom edge of the interior of the crystal returned that and ordered a second one of this watch when i first got it and pin holding band came out 3 times with no hit or pull fourth time it came out it fell onto a concrete floor and fractured the crystal send it in to the peugeot warranty service and they replaced the crystal i also indicated the issue with the pin and requested that they check to see if the pin or holes pin goes into were defective got the watch back and the crystal repair looked perfect second time i wore with watch the pin popped right out again this time i caught the watch prior to it falling onto a floor and again cracking the crystal whether the warranty center didnt check the pin issue or this is a common issue with this watch this reviewer cant say but considering the watch was purchased only six months ago and the pin has come out 6 times at least and the watch has been at the warranty center for a period of the six months this watch seems to me more trouble than it is worth the styling is nice and this reviewer loved the watch prior to it falling off the wrist every time it was worn,0
after u wear a few times they lose a bit of cusion,2
cheaply made and not worth wasting your money on,0
way tight on my temples gave them to my 8 year old,1
bought them for work feel good,2
too large for a ladies watch it was returned,0
horrible,0
this turned out super small and the length was a little weird,0
bought these at the request of my husband for his birthday he says they fit great are very comfortable and exactly as described he has asked me to order more so they are worth the money,2
im not sure i could call this pilling but the fabric is starting to look worn and snaggy not quite pills but the fabric looks rough on the surface when it was smooth at first ive only worn and washed this a few times but it already looks old and worn out,1
i liked it a lot but i paid far more than what it was worth i should have paid half it fits my phone and a few very small things and couldnt also fit in my wallet i should have stopped myself from buying this,1
i agree with most of the reviews i own an older version and the fabric is thicker and the cut of the pattern is fuller the older short was made in taiwan new one in indonesia i dont mind the thinner fabric cause it is cooler i do not like the goofy cut down of the leg and then a bit of flair that is what mostly turns it into houseyard wear but it seems to work well in the garden with squatting to pull weeds i am short in the stride and this short looks just right,1
its cute my little cousin loves it of course however setting the time is so complicated she was impatient she is wearing the watch with the wrong time on it i give this 2 stars just because she loves it i had planned to send it back since i received it late this was suppose to be a xmas gift but it worked out bc her birthday is on new years eve,0
good fit and quality hat for a low price the writing and logo looks like a decal so i am a bit skeptical how it will hold up to laundry washings i will let you know and possibly upgrade my review,1
updated 42022 it is now 5 months after getting this wallet and i still love it i keep coming back to the order to see what other colors there are but i am looking for pale summer colors i am not exactly easy on my wallets and it has held up just fine zippers are good stitching is good and the leather is still soft the card slots are a bit small but that happens in a lot of walletsbr original review 112021 i am a wallet snobbut i live this wallet it holds exactly as described has no obscene odor like some others zips nicely and fits in the hand perfect i will buy this again in other colors when needed,2
i ordered the green and the red label socks they fit as expected but the top hem is very poorly sewn its starting to loosen or fully come apart after just one wash they work but will probably only last a few months,1
not much support but thats not why i bought it its cute and will serve its purpose nicely,2
these are a lot baggier and bigger than i envisioned i dont mind for wearing around the house in the summer but i wouldnt wear them out maybe size down although the waist was sized okay its elastic so there is some give,1
very useful for travel time passportcards protection,2
runs big but good quality and color,2
beautiful but very cheap the clasp broke after a month,1
terrible too small,0
way too big,0
very small and short,0
lower your expectations to the level of the price and you wont be disappointedbr biggest issue to me was the extremely long delivery time,1
i ordered white and got something between eggshell and beige additionally i dont know how this would be an effective belt with how much and how easily it stretches i have a couple of other stretch belts that are great they offer some resistance before they stretch and max out at 23 this belt stretches at least 12 with no effort so unless you want it as merely a fashion accessory rather than functional go for it i returned before ever wearing it so cant speak to durability,0
i got this in an xs i wear an xs or a s the top part was huge compared to the rest which fit as expected the style was ok but the asymmetric hem on the legs was not flattering and i have good looking legs its a decent drews but there was nothing about the fabric style fit and finish that would justify the high price tag,1
strap was lousy got caught in hair constantly,2
these laces work well for a person with special needs they make it easier to loosen the shoe take it off and also to put it on and tighten the laces there are no loose ends dragging to pose a risk of tripping they seem sturdy so far,2
i like the shoe but dislike the insole way too thin and my feet are aching,1
great product works as described,2
love my coach slipons the fit and quality are perfect they are comfortable and will go with almost everything,2
i really like this piece that said im a short person if youre bigger than 52 120 this will fit funny the sleeves will be short and tight it had a faint aroma from shipping that airing out removed i was complimented on it the first wear out,2
we tried writing on it with the light provided in the dark even with going slow and multiple times over the same line it is so faint that you can barely see any lines you cant draw on it nice idea but doesnt work its a nice shirt but i couldve gotten a nice shirt for much cheaper without this feature that doesnt work,0
this is a particularly flattering wrap dress the cut highlights your waist and the drape of material camouflages your tummy i love the cap sleeves and the knee length too one of the other nice features is that there is a button as well as the tie to keep the dress closedbr br my complaint is the way the material clings in back even with a slip you can see every line of your bra and underwear a pattern may disguise this better though,1
not sure how to review something that i returned homywolf sizes this product as 4445 exactly the same as the homywolf mens slippers knitted cotton bedroom ones which fit me fine but the actual sizes are dramatically different i am normally shoe size 115 or 12,1
ripped in 4 different spots within 2 hours,0
i have other pairs of ariat boots but this was the first pair ive purchased that was made in china and the least expensive they are very nice good ariat fit and typical easy break in but they run a little small compared to the other more expensive styles i have tried it may be due to the fact they are made in china and the other styles i wear are made in mexico the shaft of these boots is also very soft making it a minor difficulty to pull my jeans down over them for the price im not disappointed in these boots but in the future i will spend the extra 50100 for their other styles to get better fit finish and wear for everyday kick around i will probably get 2 or 3 years out of them but unlike my other ariats these wont be worth a new sole when the time comes,1
im returning this upper arm sleeve im elderly and have upper arm pain from using a cane i wanted something to support the flacid muscle i ordered a size larger because of comments that it runs small and indeed it does but this sleeve is a lighweight elastic and it rolled down at the top until it was almost the size of a bandaid i even tried skin glue jobsts that i use for keeping up compression hose and the glue works great for that but it didnt work on this arm sleeve a little helpful hint as for my arm pain this morning after mulling over what to do i pulled on a knee high open toe compression hose to the shoulder and its working great so far in supporting the arm pain is subsiding,0
design is beautiful but material is very fragile make sure you ring is packageddelivered in a sturdy boxpackaging or your ring may be compromised,1
very bad fabric,0
i would normally wear a 22 but need a 20 in these the material is thin but keeps its shape the waist is big in case youre thick in that area,2
these are so comfortable and warm i love that they have an adjustable strap so they stay on securely,2
love the softness and small straps,2
i bought this watch because i wanted something that i could wear all of the time even when swimming i noticed when watching videos about invicta waterresistant watches that the crown needs to screw down tight in order for it to keep water out mine does not it just keeps turning the watch is advertised as having 100meter water resistance on both amazon and the invicta stores website i sent an email to their service department and asked if it is safe in water they said no no swimming no shower or bath no getting it wet they also said the 3year warranty wont cover it for water damage i have already adjusted the band to fit me and it is pretty so i will keep it but i specifically bought it to swim in,0
a little gaudy definitely looks like costume jewelry,1
these are pretty cute my family says they cant really tell what they are from a distance and they are very hard to put in,1
this item was to be used to keep an elderly warm,0
isnt long enough to cover your lower neck so you have exposed skin above t shirt collar,0
this was a gift for my sister she loves mountain mens tshirts the was as expected,2
completely wrong dress this one was paper thin poorly made glue all over it,0
disappointed,0
strong odor when you first open,2
just exactly what i was looking forgood solid ring good quality arrived quickly and in perfect condition thank you so much,2
muy lindo me encantogracias amazon mi tienda favorita,2
too small,0
i am not a purse person at all i have one out of necessity i have a larger purse with everything in it but this suits me so well i use it as awallet with all my essentials in it i can just grab it and run in to the store it is roomy considering the size well made i will definitely buy a few more,2
maybe im not cleaning it often enough or im not cleaning things for long enough but when following the instructions i really havent noticed much of a change with my rings,1
runs way too big definitely order a size smaller on this shirt excellent value on a rugged useful shirtbr i ordered the xxl as usual it is just huge and doesnt shrink at allbr the price is so reasonable i bought another one but in xl and i will just give the xxl away,2
the lenses are darker than they look in the picture thats actually good for me my eyes are very photo sensitive they clip on my glasses well and dont scratch they do ship from china and take about a week to get there the shipping is faster than most things ive received from china they each came in their own plastic case and with three cleaning cloths,2
i like the fact that this bra comes with extenders because i definitely needed them because it seemed really small therefore i recommend ordering a size up,2
needed some simple sneakers for summer to replace my old ones i usually by converse but these were cheeper and same style they looked nice and are ok on comfort but they have started to fall apart much sooner then the converse typically do,1
fit great but wow these things are like sandpaper on your legs,1
while this belt serves its purpose it is made rather cheaply i was not overly impressed but for the price its not terrible,1
order 1 or two sizes larger im 190 order a size large and didnt fit,0
this looks fantastic,2
the cups are way too small for the size of the shirt my husband said it made my boobs look deformed,0
i ordered the 2 4 pack black charmleaks womens cotton underwear bikini hipster pantiesbr br i found the fit to be inconsistent one pack they all fit the same but the second pack had two pairs that were way to tightbr br the pack that did fit i found were nice they were soft and washed well,1
fit very well and stay on my 2 year old,2
these are way too small order 2 sizes up if you want to get a full season out of them,0
i recently purchased my second glenor co jewelry box and once again i am blown away with the quality of this organizer it is high quality right from the shipping box through to the individually lined compartments i noticed in the description the words elegant sophistication beauty and class i couldnt agree more i would recommend this jewelry box organizer in a heartbeat,2
i was expecting a bit thicker of a sock wish they were thicker i bought 2 sets of them so im kinda bummed but if thats what you like then these are for you,1
like very nice and lightweight,2
cute bigger than i thought the tail is made out very hard plastic not bendable or stretchy still cute though,2
very poorly made,0
this dress had a poor quality material plus its too big,0
lightweight and easy to use i ordered another order,2
trey nice leather the clasp was a little different but i figured it out in a few minutes i like that it stays hooked better than most clasps,2
half the socks didnt fit him and broke when he tried taking them off,0
needed a new swim suit for travel and this was exactly the right choice,2
i love the necklace and so did my girlfriend whom i bought it for the packaging was awesome nice job i will not hesitate to order again,2
my mother spotted this specific necklaceso placed the order it arrived fast and she loves it she agrees its great to wear to go out sometimes all in all she rates 5,2
i love our samsonite graviton luggage ive had this set for almost 5 years and travel via airline 45 times per year including international travel this set has held up awesome considering the abuse it is put though by baggage handlers within the first year of ownership our carry on handle broke due to the airlines rough handling and i took it to an authorized repair shop luckily there is one in the city i live in the part was no longer available so the bag was replaced for free under samsonites lifetime warranty shipped direct to my door via samsonite customer service 6 months ago the zippers broke on one of my 2434 bags so that i could no longer lock it i again took it to my local authorized repair shop and the zippers were replaced again under the samsonite warranty i have nothing but great things to say about this bag and the samsonite warranty as ive experienced it the past 5 years this was the best wedding present it is light weight unique looking so i never wonder if im picking up the wrong bag easy to pack,2
perfect for a maid costume except the wrist things were kinda huge lol,2
its a sweater with buttons i love the color its easy to put on over your head and take off prefect,2
these look and nice seem well madebr but xl was the largest size available so i took a chancebr no way josebr im 50 waist sedentary retired fat american now at 77br these xl can be no bigger than 36 fully stretched see image and tape measurebr clearly a cultural difference do they make xxxl br the manufacturer should list size by inches or mm when doing international sales,1
the lace parts just kind of bunch up and dont look flattering,0
ordered these for my grandsons for christmas i didnt know the item was for toddler sizes,1
,2
good product,2
i was looking to purchase an inexpensive everyday watch and was impressed when i received my order the watch looked like its picture and functions well as long as you remember to wind it up i would recommend the product to others,2
i had to return these they fly off my feet every time i take a step if the straps were adjustable that would be helpful but they are not,0
not what i expected its worth the price but dont expect anymore than that not as nice as it looks online,1
the skirt us beautiful it only took 3 months to get it but its beautiful,2
funny story and spoiler alert my teenage son thought jackalopes were real so these socks were the perfect gag gift for him i also bought a tshirt see other review he wears patterned colored socks with dress pants but he loves these and were such a hit he wears them with jeans too they are a nice medium weight sock soft wash well and no uncomfortable seams highly recommend,2
im a solid size 6br these a so baggy especially in the legs i could get two legs into one leg of the pantsbr br i tired hot water wash hot dryer hoping to shrink no luck so now im going to have to give away because i washed i cant return,0
light weight and too small for medo not fir my wrist,1
buttons are barely sewed on if taking on and off a mask re sew yourself,0
very cute i want to get more colors,2
loved this great blocking sweat and keeping the head cool also very nice looking,2
both broke 1st time i wore them very disappointed,0
okay but cheap qualitybr probably wrong but again,0
boots fit great i have wide calves and this boot in my shoe size fits me wonderfully so easy to put on and off,2
poor quality poor on the 2nd use,0
i typically wear an xs so i got a small thinking theyd be a little loose and they were huge i honestly think an xs wouldve been too big id size down if i were you,0
this is a gift for my husband and its nice light weight jacket for cooler days the only issue is that he has broad shoulders so its a little fitting in that area but overall still fits him nicely and he said it does feel too tight where he cant move in it,1
to small and took forever to arrive,0
heavy weight well made sweater adorable for christmas or after i got it with a red and navy onesie so he could wear it often cute with jeans,2
its rigid rubber,0
liked the hat but if you had a largertaller head itll probably fit too short on you,1
smaller than expected but i like the fact thats 100 cotton,1
cheap,0
this shirt is very thin good to wear under something else which is what i bought it for,1
this was a pretty backpack but it broke after i had been using a few months,0
shirt i received is nothing like shown this material is really strange and it feels like a really thick childs bathing suit it is really wide and really short like you should be 3 feet tall horrible purchase,0
im slowly growing a collection of lapel pinsbrooches im really into them right now and i love the idea of wearing a few grouped together with fallwinter outfits kind of a sophisticated take on geek chic this pin fits the bill nicely yes the quality could be better but its not something ill wear all the time so it doesnt bother me the price for it could be lower but if it will work for a certain outfit its not a bad buy the overall construction is good and the clasp stays in place well im not sure if its supposed to be this way but the finish has come off the edges of the pin it looks slightly distressed but nothing anyone will pay attention to the colors are richly done the detailing is good not great but good enough i know its a mens lapel brooch but this will suit my needs nicely,1
love these yoga pants they are super fitted and stay in place i only wore under armour for a long time but noticed they just keep falling down my aunt wears these and suggested them im hooked ordering more,2
love these star earringsthey are delicate but not too small wish they had leverbacks instead of fishhooks but other than that i am very happy with them i would buy them again,2
i returned these for size they run small theyre also cut kind of low not happy trying to replace the 1012 new balance constantly changes the cut of their sneakers for the worse i dont know why they cant just leave well enough alone,1
love the highlow bottom hemline and elastic waistband material was soft and stretchy and the style fit as expected the vneck was a bit low cut for my preference but i made it work,1
i am 57 130 pounds and i got a small cute fitted sweater and is very warm,2
theyre cute and comfortable and i like the color they do run wide though and because the material has give to it they dont support foot stability as much as i would like,1
cool concept i wear a size 7 engagement ring without a wedding band currently so i got the adjustable sized package for when i do have my band and even the largest size option cut off my circulation and made my finger red and swollen,0
this are more like tights and very constricting,0
received the top with no bottoms big boobie girls these cups are very small and will expose you,0
the material is really good not to thick not to thin lovely dress would recommend,2
i purchased two as gifts for babies in other states and both families are delighted,2
i am 55 and 145 lbs i purchased a medium this dress is comfortable and fits nicely i received several compliments on it the first day i wore it,2
what a perfect shirt to match the color palette for darren hayes upcoming concert it looks great on me and its so soft cant believe how perfect this shirt was for what i was looking for peach floral,2
perfect size not too small can fit everything i need inside quality is great,2
fast shipping amazing seller a best price easy payment item works,2
not made for the average african american womans build,0
i ordinarily wear either a m or l and yet the m is even too big for me its nice material though just order a size or two down as this runs very large and long,1
love this dress and great price fabric has a lot of stretch wish there was an xs so i could have sized down,2
nice shoues but runs small half size up,1
my grandson loves them hes 12 they were his choice and we are happy hes happy,2
where do i begin i had such high hopes for this dress because the yellow used as the purchasing photo is beautiful however this dress is horrible the material is cheap and it looks nothing like the photo,0
i love these theyre super cute and very comfortable the colors are almost exact to the picture the dark blue one is a little darker still gorgeous there are only two that seem to be plastic and not stone but for ten bucks who cares i dont regret my purchase at all the post is a little bit shorter than the one i got it pierced with which is good definitely a safe christmas or birthday present for a loved one,2
mittens are warm but string broke on day 1,0
this product is very disappointing the shoes i received dont even light up and im having a very difficult time getting the company to work with me on returning them to the point i just gave up my money went right down the drain,0
i use these to lounge around the house and sleep in at night i never wake up sweaty in them which is a huge plus but i dont get unduly cold wearing them around the house either theyre still not my favorite sleep shirts because they dont slide well across my cotton sheets and i always have to untwist them after i roll over but none of that is really their intended purpose so im still giving them 5 starsbr br if anybody knows the perfect sleep shirt that breathes as well as these hugs the torso without constricting and slides like satin across sheets without twisting please comment on this review,2
great for outdoor activities,2
i love the top to this 2 piece suit it fits exactly as size ordered should but the bottoms are more like a med so those wont fit me havent worn it yet but seems to be of good quality disappointed in bottoms but will just wear bottoms of my old suit with the top,1
went downtown to do a pub crawl and they were super comfortable and fit great just be careful walking in them as i scraped the front pointy bit of the shoe on the sidewalk and ruined them a bit but overall wonderfully made,2
i love these shorts they are very comfortable and look great as well,2
i am 51 and 145and the bottom was super saggy and the front hung lower than it shouldbr the bra portion didnt fit all that well either i had hoped for a little bit of support and there little to nothingbr if i would have tried it on at a store i would have put it in the nope side,1
its ok for the price cheap layering shirt material is thin and see through and a little short i am 5quot11quot and long waisted so it may not be that way on others,1
let me start by saying that i love that this wallet has rfid but thats pretty much the only thing i like about it first off it has so much leatherin the form of slots for cards and folded layersthat once you add your actual content to the wallet its essentially round thats right filling each of the many card slotseven without any billscreates wallet that is so full it wont even close sure theres 34extra capacity34 but thats like jamming 16 seats into a honda civic and called it 34extra capacity34maybe for micebr br the leather is ok but the stitching on mine doesnt look like its going to hold up overall this wallet is just ok there are better more functional wallets out there especially if you need more 34capacity34,1
thank you,2
while it is pretty in appearance it lacks quality my daughter put it on and the clasp broke the first time she wore it i guess you get what you pay for,0
i am such a huge soprano fan was so excited to get this shirt as the one i had got ruined love it but wish they had a large,2
i ordered these mask because a customer wanted custom made mask i love the color comfort and material,2
these leggings are very soft but also much thinner fabric than i expected theyre fine for wearing as a base layer or when the weather is warmer but not for a single layer on a cold day,1
the pins that came with the kit dont even work for the gear,0
they broke right away,0
nothing at all like the pic,0
they didnt hold up nicely over time,1
these say relaxed fit and they are wide i had to buy an insert to wear in them to take up the extra room and i dont have petite feet im not sure if the advantage to the relaxed fit in shoes shoes need to stay on,1
the watch was nice and my daughter was excited sadly it was not functioning due to a dead battery,0
it was christmas gift for my son but sadly after 4 days of being worn one of the dragon heads fell off,1
neckline and shoulders dont look like the picturebr i ordered size small i guess its also a large see top left imagebr im 5 about 125lbsbr material isnt bad its kinda of softbr shirt is longer in the back than the front,1
hoodie is perfect weight and well made however description says the grey is 95cotton and its a cottonpoly blend sending it back,1
cheaply made too big and uncomfortable,0
the shirt was too small for a medium and the material was very thin seller refused to provide a paid shipping label and amazon customer service is giving us the runaround even though we have prime dont waste your time and money on this item or seller,0
bought these for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved them would definitely buy again,2
heavy could hardly see the wording chain turned greyblack with 4 daysbr it is pretty when not used,1
soooo adorablewould get again,2
my wife likes these but be aware that there is no little lacy stuff around the neckline and that the heavyweight is no different from the light weight,1
this piece is interesting i think i would be ok if it was either a scarf or a shawl as is the size is not right for either too small for a shawl you can feel the breeze on your back while wearing it and too big for a scarf its hard to style because its so bulky,1
i like the whole waist band i thought everything was connected but it is all separate pieces but it still gets the job done the torso part is not as long as i thought either or i might just have a long one lol,1
a nice soft warm robe,2
these masks were too small for my petite female face and when i breathed in it would suck against my face not very pleasant to wear,0
comfortable and nice looking however blocks very little noise i wear them at work and can hear all coworkers very clearly,1
got as a gift for my boyfriend he said the magnet for the bills is a little on the weaker side and if you have more than 12 bills it cant keep them clasped,1
i love brahmin bags and this color is so fun yet elegant,2
this wasnt what i expected it looks pretty on the computer but when i received it it looked like pepto bismol,1
not what i expected tooo thin for a child at winter will be sending back,0
the pants fit like a 4t but the top was a lot smaller especially the sleeves tooooo tight,1
fit well arrived quickly the only problem is that the text is too small and fades into the background,1
not true to size,1
cheap probably would be best for girls with a smaller bust i didnt look right on me,0
these are extremely thinanyone expecting any thermal benefit from these will be disappointed the thumb holes are crucial though,1
super hard to undo the straps thats also a good feature because straps that dont stay strapped are annoying the body is very long so theyd be better for taller people i cant really speak for sizei got them a couple sizes larger to get longjohns underthese are very loose fitting i love the buttons at the waistthey allow for a larger waist the construction is good and they wash up well im willing to try a smaller size for warm weather,1
was soooooo ugly looked nothing like the picture,0
great purse lots of room in it,2
my hopes were for a summery top that flowed in an aline cut instead it nips slightly at the waist and then flares only slightly if you are looking for a tight fit or body hugging fit then its true to size if you are looking for a more flowing fit youll need to acquire a very straight body or size up and hope for the bestbr br i ordered the white its more transparent than id like the fabric feels decidedly synthetic overall a miss for me but the price point is good and i can see that it could work well for others,1
had dog chew other watch band and this is a perfect match to original timax watch purchased was somewhat small but since he is a teenager13 had a couple links removed but would be too short for an adult,2
looks very good,2
i liked the design but when i received it and tried it on i didnt care for the material it was more like a house dress the material looked a little thicker on the picture had to request refund on the item,1
this scarf looks nice but it is not at all like cashmere not one little bit it is scratchy not soft,1
make sure to read the dimensions very well bigger size might have been better not enough space for multiple phones,1
not sure if i got a damaged shirt it is an iron on with letters peeling off not vintage faded look as in pictures i have this exact same shirt from another seller and this is no where near the same shirt or qualitydo not recommend,0
my son has an average size head he is 8 months old and this hat fit him very snug first time he used it later when i took it off he had imprints from the seam on his head i was disappointed as i had ordered the matching booties i wont be using this hat for him any more,0
love it always complimented on cloudstyles blazers and this one is especially dashing,2
product as described and fits true to size,2
these are cute and they look really pretty but theyre bigger than i thought theyre a good 23 inches tall i guess i thought they would be daintier maybe the description said so and i didnt pay attention my daughter got them for christmas and she said she likes them but im not sure if shell wear them because of the size well see,1
a little uncomfortable but a good looking watch,1
my wife looks hot in this bathing suit but its a more modest kind of hot you know the kind where you can look good at the pool while taking care of your ittle kids only issue she has its she needs help putting on the second strap every time all in all a good suit at a very good price,2
exactly as described good quality thanks,2
the mask is overly large and not formfitting to the face its a little too heavy which makes it uncomfortable to wear,0
buffalo heather color is different narrow fit long sleeves does not stretch much at all like the basic columbia fleece or the other cascade i got in blue with zippered pockets looking at columbia website this is what a cascade explorer is httpswwwamazoncomgpproductb01mqklnaurefoh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00ieutf8psc1br so it runs very narrow and it wont stretch if you have any kind of belly etc might be great for thin people kind of rough inside does not feel nice a soft and cozy my new blue cascade is soft and nice still narrower than my more boxy older columbia fleece but way better than this one,1
i am 143lbs 55 a 36c waist 27 and buy large mostly color is deep navy ordered up xxlbr prosbr fabric is good quality feels nice nothing is cheapbr fits nice in the boobs butbr consbr sleves are so so longmust go to the taylor see photo with hand at my sidebr photo of woman shows more of a silvery kind of look blue yes but not dark navy,1
dont buy,0
very stiff and uncomfortable,0
awful these leggings are not stretchy i wear size xs but bought sizes s and m for my daughters they could not put them on but even if they could leggings would be too short size s barely fit me i am 52 102 lb but i still cant move in them because theyre not stretchy at all size m fit better around hips but too baggy at the bottom i wish i could return,0
nice bracelet but the goldish clasp looks very cheap,0
my daughter loves this dress it fits her very well she was very pleased with the color and the style of the dress she will be wearing the dress to a sweet sixteen party,2
put it on and was ripped at the seam,0
sending these back i found that they were very wide i usually wear size 8 these fit the length of my foot but they were really wide and i would have had to wear a thick sock with them without a sock when i walked they rubbed the top of my toes and hurt the top part of my foot they have a light weight feel when you have them on but just to wide,0
the pashima are a bargain,2
this is a very hard soled shoe almost like hard plastic using on carpet it is fine but any hard surface and the shoe is loud and not comfortable,1
cute but not super comfortable i bought them to ride horses and they work great for this since i dont have to walk around in them a lot i dont think i would wear these if i were to be on my feet a long time,1
runs small looks great just a little snug,2
i wear these when im working or hiking in the woods and they are a must keeps the black flies and mosquitoes from my head,2
this is such a fun tie the fabric quality is very good and its a pretty faithful representation of the scream as a closeup of the individual and with the orange cropped out i actually saw the painting in oslo and the tie does it justice the recipient of this gift just loved itprobably distills the whole office atmospherebr i received no compensation whatsoever for this review,2
nice dress and the material is good,2
these are a nice style but theyre cheap plastic and kept coming out of my cuffs because the moving part is too loose,0
these are name brand pull on jeans that fit just right they dont get all baggy after wearing them for a while the fabric is very good i purchased 10 short and im 53 and they hit just below my ankle did not need to hem i plan to purchase a black pair happy customer,2
gorgeous expensive real high quality gold,2
beautiful fit and feel,2
from the second i started pulling the shirt out of the bag i knew i was in for an experiencebr br the shirt is ugly the color is ugly more of a burnt orange than a soft pink as depicted the top looks more like a carelessly stitched smock the fabric is horrendous stiff itchy and so uncomfortable thin cardboard would be preferable to this fabricbr br the stitching is loose lazy and awful in itself in one of my pictures the stitching comes outside of the fabric another one the seam is closed facing towards opposite directions on either end the knotting at the end of some of the seams looks like just a ton of loose thread and there are loose threads all over the shirt that you would have to sit there and try to burn off each and every one of thembr br some of the seams dont even know where theyre supposed to be because the sewing on this shirt is so awful that some of them are folded over and under and every which way and it is pulling the shirt in all kinds of directions and the shirt just doesnt even know what to do with itself the seams for the shoulder line for example instead of lying nicely flat and open like any other normal article of clothing theyre all folded in and over themselves and because its an issue with the sewing it cannot be fixed simply by ironing it flatbr br not to mention how awful this shirt came out of the bag full of hardlined wrinkles stiffer than pleats if you are somehow still really set on getting this shirt just make sure you have time to wash it and clean it up before whatever your event isbr br ive gotten better shirts for 3 each at target this thing is 25 for basically what is a scambr br this is the worst thing ive ever bought its just an awful shirt,0
color fades after few washes,1
definitely fits as a juniors large would im a 68 and would have been better fitted in an xl super cute though,2
jacket didnt fit me at all run too small for x large size,0
im 510 130 lbs i ordered an xs tall the length was fine but the fit was terrible when the drawstring is pulled it gives this very unflattering baggy bunched up crotch area i didnt like the material enough to re order in an xxs,1
this broke after a few months the large zipper in the back broke first and then a few days later the top carrying strap broke as i was walking and all of my stuff fell out dont waste your money,0
this shirt ran too small was made of thin material granted it was incredibly cheap but could i turn back time i would not buy this again,0
these shoes look great as shown online but the real thing was a letdown in quality the soles and insoles are inadequate for a comfortable walking experience and the fit is very narrowand im returning them,0
this slipper did not fit at all like a 3e it was beautiful and well made but definitely not the size we needed,1
i have a severe nickel allergy and this has helped me steer clear of nickel and test everything in my clothing and around my home just to be safe,2
thumbs down and will not wear it ever weird fit and it pops up,0
very nice watch works great easy to setup nice display which is very easy to read,2
the band itself is well made its a good product it has a good feel to itbr br i feel bad giving it two stars but feel like i have to do to the lack of response from the makers truffol despite their effort to project themselves as a company that cares with their thoughtful note within the band case and follow up emails asking for reviews have done nothing to try and resolve my issue if you do decide to buy a band from them make sure you get exactly what you want it costs 7 to return this 15 bandbr br the problem i had was that the band was to wide for my watch after hearing nothing from truffol about any way to try and figure out a solution that didnt involve me paying half of what it cost me to return it i decided to buy a albeit lesser quality four pack of watch bands from ritche i used the thinner pins that came with these and cut notches on the truffol band working well for me so far,0
the style and fit of the shoe is great however after wearing the shoe for 30 minutes i noticed my toes looked dirty upon removing the shoes i found the black dye was rubbing off onto my feet,0
it was very bulky so not flattering,1
an obvious ripoff of the gym shark version but cool with me because these are wayyy cheaper cute outfit overall but it doesnt fit me perfectly lines on the butt should be right under the butt cheek but the lines are a little high on me i think this is because i have bigger hipsbutt but others may not have this issue just beware if youve got a bigger bottom besides the lines the outfit overall fits fine i am 55 145lb and got a size large i wore it all day and is pretty comfortable not my favorite fits very much like the seamless line from fabletics which is skintight some people love it and say it fits like a second skin but i am lukewarm on the fit because after a while im ready to take them off it almost feels like im wearing a giant compression sock,0
it was a great coat especially for the price but it advertised as red the coat is more of an orangypinky red than a true red,1
i didnt even get it out of the bag i unzipped the bag saw felt the material and zipped it right back up,0
used it for europe good product,2
its smaller than described my laptop is about 135 long and it doesnt fit in the description says over 14 long otherwise really good looking bag and material and i so wish it was as long as the description said sadly returning it,1
i bought these aug 2018 and im still wearing them a year later in sept 2019 i mostly wear them to the office but theyve done 10ish beach trips and 20 sits in the 185 degree sauna i got these in navy and based on other reviews it looks like theyve held up better than some other colors im ordering a new pair now because these just started looking shabby the foot bed is super comfortable for me i hope they keep making these forever i might just have to buy multiple pairs,2
,0
i found the botice to be too short the fabric is beautiful,1
the watch is nice but it resets the time all of the time i think when the shirt sleeve hits the touch portion enough times it resets i like the watch but i cant count on the time cool novelty but unreliable time if it keeps resetting,1
great value and fit right on size will buy again in different colors,2
i cannot stress this enough short i am average height for a girl 54 and this hits my ankles so disappointing the material isnt all that great either kinda seethrough it doesnt have a good stretch to it which if you are larger than a b cup good luckbr i would not recommend,0
they must have strange cows in china because the surface material of these belts stretches like taffy it really pos me that merchants can flat out lie about their product with impunitybr br the description says 100 leather this is not even 1 leather and yes it does smell and the smell is of vinyl not leatherbr br special tanning process my azz how does vinyl get tannedbr br the merchant even responds to questions about the material claiming it is 100 leather it isntbr br the belt looks good who knows how long it will last because the merchant lies about the materialbr br someone averse to wearing animal skin might like this product but they will never know because it is misrepresented as leatherbr br i gave this two stars only because it does look good out of the box lying merchants po me in fact any one lying to persuade me pos me,0
the material seemed thick fuzzy and warm but these were way too short and way too small returned,0
comfy,2
too thin,0
the strap ripped off the base less than a month into having it which is a shame i really liked this bag,0
poor qualitythe jacket in the picture looks different not worth 30 dollars,0
the fleece part is awesome and true to size but the outside shell runs small so its kinda like a catch 22 bc if you order up the inside will be to big,1
great breathability flexible we ordered and returned 10 pairs finallythese were the purchase,2
this was a gift and the person i gave them to said they were too ugly and looked giant he would not even try them on to be honest i thought they looked really big when he took them out of the box too i returned them and as usual amazon did a great job on returnsbr he loves the other crocs clogs though,0
my son loves these shirts true to size,2
love this suit very flattering,2
the size fits as expected so dont listen to anyone review if it doesnt fit you it means that you wear different sizebr the only thing that i didnt like is the materialvery cheap and poorly made,1
the tassles look cheap but everything else is nice,1
very cute shirt its not screen print is actual iron on decal so im not sure how long it will last also when it arrived the fit was perfect however i washed it and it shrank a lot if you cant order two size up i would suggest not ordering it,0
this product was made well but it runs very large and very wide,0
does a great job of keeping out the uv rays but since the fabric is kind of thick due to the undercoating its almost impossible to quickly refold the umbrella to its compact state and secure it with the velcro it takes time to refold each flap and compress everything and ive given up on getting it to fit back in its case thats my biggest beef its not round when it folds up its flatish and that doesnt help,1
a little large for my boys but the hats made them happy fairly well made and sturdy,2
lived the design and the colors but the sizing is completely off an xl is more like a small,0
i recommend for a quick but its not as nice but fit well,0
the wife bought this to replace my actual wedding ring i didnt want to ruin it but it immediately turned my finger green i coated in in clear nail polish after and it seems to be working,1
great belt,2
sent back way to heavy for meand thats when it was empty,0
i love it i wore it for halloween,2
the colors were bright and pretty which was nice but the fabric was like a tight plastic type chiffon also the chest area was extremely tight and was very unflattering the shape would have been nice but overall it was a let down,0
this cardigan is super cute and the fabric itself is nice however i snapped the top snap and then when i went to unsnap it not tugging on the fabric it pulled out of the fabric still a cute sweater just will have to reinforce the snaps,1
bought these for a gift they loved them,2
loved these shoes at first but not so much now they want stay on the velcro doesnt work anymore going to send them back,0
didnt like the quality and how it makes me look i my opinion its totally summer dress not the cocktail dress,0
bought them for my kids for school and they do not like them and they are not comfortable to them,1
i really like it as it is very soft and comfortable i personally bought it to avoid chaffing on my thighs i use it right on the waistline because if i bringing it any higher it rolls down and its extremely annoying as this is the part that i hate on most shapewear,1
not even close to the correct size,0
es un reloj súper sencillo pero funciona súper bien y además es muy duraderobr tengo este reloj hace varios años y aún me funciona muy bien,1
super soft with snug waist does not ride up,2
too tight in my arms not much stretch in the material otherwise its okay,1
the fabric is less tshirtey and more leggingsspandexstretchy which means it didnt fall the way i expected clingynot flowy the quality is ok however there are lots of threads that need to be trimmed before wearing which makes me question how long this will last this will be pared with workout leggings for lazy days i had hoped it could be dressed up to go out but im afraid the material is just too casual,1
this is an absolutely stunning watch ensemble with sparkling swarovski crystals i am blown away by the beauty of this set i have another anne klein set that is similar and has four pieces but it is not as beautiful as thisbr br this set has three pieces one watch and two wristlets luckily it fit me perfectly right out of the box my wrist circumference is around 734 i did have some trouble fastening the clasps by myself but i eventually got them secured as you can see from the second photobr br the size can be reduced by removing the extra clasp on each piece however i am unclear as to how well the size can be increased i think if one has a large wrist this might not fit unless a jeweler can help expand it or if more links can be purchased which i am unsure aboutbr br overall this is lovely and would make a fantastic gift,2
the arch support is minimal but the price is cheap enough that you can buy insoles if you so choose,1
my husband love this doesnt have to double up on cards,2
size l fit girlfriend 5 1 36d she ties around waist notes very comfy,2
this is one of those suits that would be better sold as separates the top could benefit from some underwire construction to make the most of the sheer cut out design i am a 36 b and while i was definitely well contained in the suit i felt the strategic cut out wasnt enough to give a similar look to the models if anything the slat of the cups placement served to flatten not flatter the bottom was nice but here again i could have used a smaller size to make the most of the cut out design than what came with my top i sent this back,0
love this jacket just wish it was a little warmer great quality,2
i purchased this for my sister birthday gift a week later the medallion fell off she was very sad because we wear these according to our spirituality,0
purchased for a gift and was very comfortable and nice looking,2
i ordered a large in this top i usually wear a size large or extra large and this top was way too tight i ended up giving it to a friend since i wouldve had to pay more in shipping to return it than i paid for the shirt itself definitely order a size or two larger,1
this product is larger than advertised this product shrunk when i put it to dry in front of an air heater,0
i bought a more expensive pair thinking quality would be better the packaging was impressive and the glasses appeared to be made well but i saw no difference in reducing glare i tried them with and without my prescription glasses and didnt help at all with glare from headlights,0
i had large and its a large but for skinny person runs super small,1
i bought the medium size tops after measuring myself and looking at the size fits chart i had to send the shirts back for a larger size they are still a little tight hoping the material will loosen up a bit after a wash,1
perfect for my daughter not so much for me 150 lbs needed a bit more room,1
nice hat doesnt breath so maybe a little hot in the summer,2
this is my second purchase i just love these keychains this is wellmade durable large and super cute the color and vintage feel reminds me of family beach vacations past,2
theyre cheap in appearance i have long hair so i wasnt that concerned i wore them the first day about 8 hours my ears were a little itchy the second day my ear lobes were red and itches like crazy not happy,0
was cute but its big for females and hot,1
pretty little coin holder keeping change together,2
i purchased these for my husband i had bought something similar before and was happy this was not the case with these two out of thr 4 had rips in the seems after wareing one time will not be purchasing again,0
very cute and well made but small i bought for a 1 yet old but gave to a newborn probably 36 mo size,2
fits a bit strange will keep it but must fix very long sleaves and a bit wide at the hips,0
this product came exactly like the picture shows it is really good quality and i would recommend it to someone looking to buy a broncos hat,2
the fish came like this,1
the letters on front of shirt peeled right off sent the shirt back and got a new one and did the same thing,0
too big and very cheap material but my daughter does like it,1
these are so soft however they do shrink in the wash a little bit,2
i had bought another outfit from this company and i loved it but this one is not at all what i expected it was too small and i only weigh 110 smallmedium should have fit more than perfectly worse yet it was itchy all overbr br i sent it back may try similar from a different company last year i got the cutest most adorable elf outfit but it did take 3 tries,1
my boobs keep slipping out at the bottom the product seems to be designed without knowledge of a womans boobs,0
dress was super cute on model and in other reviews however i thought it just looked dumpy on me i purchased it to wear to a wedding however if i raised my arms it would also be waaaaaay too short while dancing,1
decent quality and fits just right but the black leather stains the white always keep it hung up,1
beautiful verse and font but too large and cheaply made it had a dingy looking white color and was returned the same day,0
earrings look better in person they are very nice i ended up ordering another pair theyre sensitive ear friendly too,2
i have use two and theyre ok,1
this is a fine little beauty of a ring i use it stacking with 34 others it looks great so far it holds its own in both color and comfort,2
its not like the other asics shoes its a bit narrower and has no arch support i wear it for looks not comfort,1
i am in love this shirt is so comfy and loose my mother bought me a size large since i am 7 months pregnant the shirt was so flattering and beyond comfortable the shirt is a tad bit big on sizing but thats how i generally like this shirtbr br as per washing i personally threw it in the wash and hung it to dry over my office chair the shirt really holds up and cannot express how well it holds up and looksbr br when i am not pregnant i still plan on wearing to workbr br 5 stars without a shadow of a doubt plan on buying another,2
the product was inexpensive for a reason worked well for a few days but the cooling gel whatever is inside the pouch seeped out throught the material over time after one week of use it was simply a cloth headband an identical item i purchased in jamaica lasted much longer,0
mask are very thick and not breathable sides do not fit due to adjustable strings being attached at each end instead of going all the way through the loop,1
i ordered the medium and it was super fitted but still looked nice my huge problem is the print i bought the shirt got it in yesterday and the letters are already peeling offbr br super unhappy because for almost 18 i couldve bought letters from walmart which is what the letters look like and made the same shirt the saying is cute the material is nice but im terrified that once i wash it that ill be left with half my letters and pissed,0
this is a beautifulextremely well made watch having said that i cant understand invicta wanting this sent back yearly for adjustments ive owned better timepieces in the past and never had to deal with an issue like that i cant really say if i would purchase another invicta product im adding to my review after living with this watch for nearly two years its crap my first impressions were so far off the mark that im embarrassed to see them here the watch keeps terrible time and theres no way on earth id send this back to the factory and pay their ridiculous charge for an adjustment steer clear,0
watch comes in nice packaging making it a nice gift if you have someone special in your life extremely elegant and classy i would not consider this watch as a thin watch the mesh band is very slim and lightweight the watch display dial part is of medium thickness not slim watch in total weighs 32 ounces which is pretty lightweight overall it has a beautiful large face and looks fabulous however battery died after 2 months and had to have it replaced for 10 less one star on review second purchase of this watch the battery lasted only 8 months look like this company is using cheap or outdated batteriesbr if you find this review helpful kindly vote below so i can improve future reviews as well,2
the toe box is really stiff and hurt my toes really bad while hiking downhill so much so that it really slowed me down because i had to hike down side stepping,1
i bought this as a gift for my husband and he loved it at first we couldnt figure out how to set the time but then my husband figured it and it looks amazing i think i want to buy one for my self but i feel it looks to manly and big on my hand he has gotten a lot of compliments on it as well over all great purchase,2
fit nicely in the armsshoulders too tight in the chest and short length im a 36dd and bought an xl returned the items material is soft though,0
these have been my favorite pair of sunnies for quite some time now they are so unique and chic turning heads everywhere i go,2
great product for a great price very happy and will buy again satisfied customer here just trying to fill the minimum word count now,2
these earrings have felt light backing and the earring backs are made of light plastic they are pretty but are not durablebr br the black pair looks like a deep blush graybr br dont think you will receive strong durable earringsbr br not truly satisfied,1
too big,0
these shoes are sooo cute but unfortunately they run a full size too small sadly i had to send them back,1
i like much modern designnot big ideal for flap of jacket,2
this leotard size 810 was too small for my 7yearold average size granddaughter she was very dissapointed,0
i received a pair as a gift and loved them so much i wanted more theyre great for winter and fun,2
im very confused about these boots they are titled being kneehigh but i have short calves and these seemed oddly low i like the general concept with the leather combined with the stretch but it is executed oddly the shape of the top of the boot is not flattering for slimming it sort of looks chunky lastly i have narrow feet and the 75 medium was way too tight on the footbed if you have no arch the lumpy ball on the inside of the sole is terribly uncomfortable i thought at first it was a manufacturing defect but indeed it is the intended shape of the insert it was unwearable,0
cool,2
the sweater was material was great the color was great and the fit was good the only issue was the stitching the bottom of sweaters was not sewn together correctly,0
good quality soft and looks just like the picture runs large,1
ouch these were not comfortable at all returned them,0
fit our purpose but you get what you pay for and these are cheap they dont look like the picture so much but again they worked for us,1
dont waste your money flimsy poorly fitting and made of fabric that is neither warm nor durable,0
the bracelets are not as sturdy as they look to be it is two separate bracelets i bought these as a gift for someone whose name starts with this letter i would have ordered two more other letters but there was no t just got them so dont know if theyll hold up after a little wear and tear,1
the bands of these plastic slippers came pressed in odd shapes and they have not yet returned to their originallyintended shape pity not worth the trouble and expense of returning them two stars plus,0
the material is thin but works fine as it stretches nice design patterns,2
i got this crossbody purse because i dont like carrying a bulky purse the nice leather purse holds my cell phone and essentialsbr 1 i can wear it crossbody keeping my hands free for shopping or have to worry about setting downmisplacing my purse when out and about,2
this wrist watch is very nice but it made for a small person it wasnt for me so i have it away,1
one of the bat ears doesnt completely flip up,2
got this because i travel a lot love it,2
like many other reviewers i did not receive the jacket i thought i was buying which is the made by johnny jacket instead i received a lock love one which was very different made in china did not have the arm of hand sweater insert as advertised beware that when purchasing this jacket you might get a different brand,0
it is a little itchy i dont think i could wear it for very long,1
definitely not worth the price the material is thin and cheap you will need to layer a tank underneath the fit is cute and flattering though,0
not promising,1
very pretty,1
def a single time wear outfit it severed the purpose but the arm bands broke while trying to put them on but what do you expect for the price,2
nice gloves just way too smallbr br constructed well and appealing to the eyebr br would recommend ordering ordering at least one size up,0
these which i bought said was a size 13 to 14 it could not have been any bigger than a size 10 there was no stretch to them at all i could barely get them halfway over my foot what a waste of moneydo not buy,0
so cute and classy,2
these shoes feel narrow compared to other skechers ive worn i wore these several times but theyve not stretched as id hoped they still hurt my feet,1
love the hat but the way its shipped is a problem yes you can go get the hat steamed and i tried but it didnt do much good luckily it was for the beach and it didnt really matter if the hat was wrinkly,1
they were smaller than i expected,1
i wore these while backpacking during a heat wave in thailand these held in the smell of laundry soap too much and then every time i wore them they would reactivate the odor of each day it just accumulated over and over i washed them and then did a couple more times with no soap and they still smelled i had to toss them,0
the knitting was too loose and it was very large kinda itchy returned,0
i purchased the red to go with my sons gym shoes and it was a perfect match i realize they are made of polyester but i am hoping they dont come untied once tied and moving around,2
nice polarized lenses this is my second pair after unfortunately losing the first in the ocean after having them for about two years,2
product not what i was expecting,0
love thwm,2
i loved the style of these i like that you cannot see my eyes but when you put them on the lenses give you an almost instant headache i think there was something wrong with them because of that i ordered two other pair with different color lenses the only reason i will be returning those is because you can see my eyes through them the were not dark enough i really wish these had worked,0
these would be nice for in back yard but not in water or locker rooms that have water on floors the bottoms is very slippery and may cause you to fall,0
the green bodice is not attached to the lace in any way unless you have the chest to hold it up on its own it will fall and fold in on itself the tulle layers are very pretty and the lace was thick very nice we ended up having to pin the bodice in several places for it to hold its place,1
bought 2 pairs of shoes for my grandsons and one pair fell apart less than a weekso pissed,0
i took these on a 12 day trip and they are great for packing except the zippers it was annoying the zippers would pull unevenly and it was a hassle to realign light weight but will replace in due time with better product,1
bought for gift was liked well,2
the socks fits well and felt good i wore the blue ones for days drive out of town and there was a noticeable difference in my leg stiffness however the black pair had a very weak spot where the sock part meets the heel part that already looks like a hole and seems like would easily become one another reviewer posted a picture of this but i decided to take a chance that it was an isolated defect but it turned out the ones i had looked the same because they are not inexpensive i decided to return these the return was very easy and went well,1
looks like a regular indian kurta,1
i wear a womens 75 and my feet are narrow they come off easily when im doing yoga so i gave them away i liked them and i was sad that they were too big,1
they were just a little too snug for my size 11 foot seemed to have just a tad too much elastic everywhere the girls love them,1
bought two both stopped openingclosing properly with very occasional use,0
super comfy and cute if you happen to be a short gal or say under 5934 this might be too long for you without alterations with say 25334 ish heels 5734 ish gals could work it with out stumbling on material you really do need to be a tall one to wear this and if you need bust coverageminimal supportat best a strapless bra with this one hopefully a strapless with a thinner cute back piece as it will show recommended underwear a low rise thong the hip area is roomier than you might think go with your gut feeling and experience with your body type to determine your needed size this is a super comfortable lounge on the deckbeach dress i love it it is super comfortable and has such a stylish back it will not however be for everyone or every body type,2
not a good value,0
best watch,2
my son could hardly get these on,0
i like wearing skirts while running and trail running i have mixed feelings about this skirt for running what i like about it are the colors and design it has a drawstring at the waist which is crucial for keeping it from falling while running the skirt isnt tight enough at the waist without it the length of the outer skirt is great i love the leg pockets as they are big enough to keep my phone and pepper spray while running there are also 2 pockets on the outer skirt on the frontsidesbr br there are a few things i wish were better about this skirt the spandex material on the legs is thin and not high quality plus they dont fit tight enough to keep from riding up between my legs which causes the dreaded chub rub i ordered the medium which fits good for casual wear but i would like the legs tighter for running and hiking also this skirt doesnt look great on me not the skirts fault its just not flattering on me mostly because of where the pockets fit overall this skirt is okay though ive had better skirts for outdoor activities most likely ill end up using this for lighter activity or gym workouts,1
bought for my grandmother she likes them very much very soft and comfortable,2
things junk broke after one bottle,0
the neck ripped after one use,0
this is not the greatest quality but the price is so much less than the other jewelry cases and it does serve its purpose so considering the price plus the function i should give it more stars but i got what i paid for,1
works with all my ratchet belt buckles and fits in the closet with my pants,2
i wish it was thicker,2
ordered a extra large when i got it i could not pull the jacket over my head very disapointed,0
i like the style and soft fabric but would order xxl next time,1
they were a strange fit,0
i really like them but i wish they werent see through,0
very comfortable and nice looking and well made great for the coming fall weather but sadly like a lot of things i think its overpriced,1
looks bigger than pictured but is very cute,2
decent wallet hoping when it get broke in it will hold 1 or 2 more cards worth the price,2
the spring hinge helps to make these computer glasses a comfy fit ive worn one pair nearly daily for almost six months and theyve held up to this frequent use the ombre color decreases glare from the computer monitor and i find that the magnification is just right for comfort in viewing would definitely purchase again but so far no need,2
very cute the fringe does come off easily though,2
a bit flimsey but ok for the price,1
return because it was so heavy weight,0
love the fabric and it is really cute but even after using the sizing chart it still came to small in the arm length and the body had to return it because i ordered an extra large and it doesnt come any bigger i also thought it had buttons on it but it only comes with hooks to keep it close,1
i usually like all the dearlover dresses because of their modesty but i did not like the white dress it was see through and the white didnt look like a white white it looked like an ugly white i wore it once to an all white party because that was the only white dress i had and it was to late to look for something else never wearing it again i do like the other colors though you need to work on your white fabric please,1
love it i thought it would was a bit short to wear out it was just fine to wear in as a sexy night gown will order more,2
looks nice but is very thin,1
i have been waring this ever since i bought it so beautiful,2
beautiful color and design love it,2
just feels and looks like a regular bra,1
you get what you pay for ive already had one cuff link break just from regular droppage but works ok otherwise,1
i have extremely high arches and narrow feet bought these for those reasons and my planter fasciitis they ended up leaving me even more sore and i ended up returning them they were cute though,0
the colors were so cutei loved it but it was just too tight around the middle,1
works perfect and smells great,2
not what a five year old likes,0
super cute and inexpensive but i just found out from the company these contain bpa kids put glasses in their mouth and bpa is readily absorbed through the skin not worth the risk i found roshambo glasses for babies and kids and they are free of bpa phthalate lead and latex and made in italy i originally purchased knockarounds because they had made a nontoxic version for the honest company but i guess the same cant be said for their usual glasses,0
i love comfys like this although to long for me 53 ill order more better to long then to short they are just an overall anytime of the year comfort pair of loungers,2
the band is to big for hand,1
the point of buying this was to make my stomach center and my butt bigger it did a good job at sucking me in but the length was too short and of the padding was barely there on my butt which hung out anyway need to be resized for taller people,0
the jersey fabric is really soft and hangs nicely very nice for the price,2
my sister and mother love its,2
the top was cute but i will wear with something else the ruched in the bottom is not flattering for shapely figures its more for hiding imperfections,1
horrible,0
lovely dress but i got a size too big so i returned it,2
will tear easily,0
this was pretty soft and not see through which i liked what i disliked was that it looked like a customer return that was already washed no tags no stickers nothing it also smelled like a spice of some sort i would have returned but i needed it for the next day i washed myself and the smell was gone but i think im done buying clothes online from amazon,1
i got these for my 15 month old twin girls who are very sensitive with other earrings after reading other reviews i decided to buy these they are so far the best theyve not had any reaction with these the size is small enough for their comfort and the earrings have not faded i just got another set to keep at homebr i love it,2
fit is little small jersey is well made back pockets are a little small my iphone 7 will not fit one its side only stating up,2
love these so cute so comfortable love love love,2
stuff five cards in every slot in this wallet and you will struggle to get the one you need back out waste of money,0
the coat itself if nice for the price however the sleeves were too short for me i ordered an xl and it was a bit small,1
i wanted a longer looser fit the fabric is pretty thin will keep as a spare shirt,1
item arrived defectivebr its squished and does not stand up like shown in the photo the lights did not work customer service said they have problems with the leds sometimes and to send it back i didnt have time to get a new one and i wouldnt purchase another one,0
very comfortable fits great good price no slipping and sliding yet look like sneakers so they are versatile,2
i liked that these had a clasp and looked more like a strapless bra but for size 34 d these did nothing skin was free of lotions and the product still didnt work it was like going without a bra but with silicone stuck to them that didnt lift i could have just worn band aids over my nipples for cheaper and done the same job product wouldnt stay in place boob tape works a little better the best ones ive sound so far are the ones that are round with what look to me like bunny ears no clasps they stick better and tend to stay in place better,0
definitely not sized for a woman,0
i will wear nothing else for every day use unless of course i am at workthe comfort is amazing aaa,2
i have worn these sandals for one season and have found them to be all around comfortable and nice looking unfortunately the buckle is already giving out because its attached to the outside of the shoe with cheap elastic which ripped rather than leather im not sure why youd make shoes all leather except for the one part that actually holds it on your foot and make that out of a teeny 12 wide bit of elastic,1
videoid3c501c16d7fbc8e1ff399693e32a470 they are sooo cuteee i love them super well made they are gorgeous,2
ok good packaging but makes my ears infected,1
looks great but the long piece thats supposed to clasp the earring together is too short for my ear it gets lost in my lobe,0
i was so excited for my waist trainer to arrive ordered what i assumed was the correct size and as soon as i put it on i just knew it wouldnt be the right fit i cant even clasp it untied the materials look sturdy and its so pretty but i dont think ill be wearing it in this size for a long long time if ever,0
i had to get the dress hemmed i ordered a small and im 52 125 lbs the dress seemed to be a bit on the cheap side as far as how it was made the seam along the side wasnt consistent as it wasnt a straight hem not sure how to describe it but the way the side hem was stitched it made it hard to determine if the slit in the dress was supposed to be on the back or side it kept shifting other than that detail the rest of the dress was great and it would make a great summer dress just wish the craftsmanship was a bit better,1
its a lovely cross perfect size,2
does not fit my glasses might be ok if it did all these solar shield clipon lenses appear only to fir smaller frames sizing guidance at the site are not useful in selecting lens,0
sizes misleading,0
didnt care for these at all i was really hoping i would the color was more like a faded out cross between brown and purple they werent attractive at all my pictures make the colors look more bright than they really arebr i went with the large so they would be comfortable i should have went with the medium it would have been plenty roomy i wear a size 6l or a 28 waist33 length in most jeans they were really high waisted on me they came up way above my belly button i am short waisted but i have long legs they were plenty long enough for me i would say the inseam is probably a 33br i kept reading how these were described as really soft the material was soft but it was what we used to call double knit its a thin knit no cotton in these i thought they would at least be cotton blend should have checked,1
overall quality wise these are nice purchased these with the intention of using them as an everyday pair of pants i have two dislikes with these pants the first is that the space between snaps is significant that if you wear these outside on a windy day one can see what you have on underneath secondly the snaps themselves easily keep unsnapping causing you to have a wardrobe malfunction when you dont want that to happenbr br so i recently wore these out for the day to run some errands while i was outside it was windy and cold the wind blew the pants around so you could see the openings between snaps so for me it looked like i was walking into the store in just my green boxers then while i was in the store i bent over to pick something up off the ground and felt the top right snap unsnap next thing i know the top snap actually ripped out from the material on one side and there i am holding my pants up not knowing what to do i ended up borrowing some tape and and did my best at taping the broken snap area at the waist togetherbr br so even with all these issues i will keep the pants they just wont be a top choice for me to wear,1
it wasnt the bright lavender color shown more muted,1
very tiny order big,0
,2
i loved the way this dress fit me it was very comfortable and flattering but the material used was so cheap looking almost like a tablecloth or bedsheets so disappointed because it could have been such a great dress dont waste your time money with this one,0
good quality fits as expected im shorter in the torso so i had to take in a bit or it wouldve been too low cut for me the beads are nice very 20s inspired but it makes for a heavy dress,1
very comfortable the gray black color scheme goes with my wardrobe,2
its the right color but its scratchy i do not recommend it,0
the fly in front isnt necessary and never used but it causes the left leg to rise upshift because the material isnt held in place as well on the side with the fly opening overall i like them but wish they didnt have a fly opening,1
dont disregard the other reviews like i did this has to be a juniors sized top theres no way its a womens size i ordered an xl usually i wear a m or l and it was ridiculously small too bad because it was cute and would have been a perfect complement to my sons batman costume,0
too small i have to return the size you advertise is wrong i wear 36 waist pants i ordered a 38 doesnt fit,0
needed to return due to the dress not fitting well at all,0
these had tight elastic tops are very small like boys size they didnt feel like cotton either,0
these are very nice shorts but they are on the thin side probably why they are so affordable best for summer time,2
its not bad its just not real good the color is off regular dark brown the dye on the brown is uneven and streaked a bit see picture the leather on the bottom if thats what it actually is seems to be of low quality the stitching and hardware seem nice i returned it because i wanted a higher quality watch band with a lighter brown and with a yellowgold color like the picture its possible that this is a good watch band for the price i havent looked around that much the vendor was responsive and tried to be helpful,1
yes this is authentic chain mail but the descriptions are completely inaccurate the body and arm length are significantly longer than advertised it also says that it is 15lbs and mine weighs in at 20lbs everything except the material was falsely advertised i would like a refund,0
54 160lbs m sizebr fits perfect,0
these are really cute there seems to be some quality variation in the fluffiness if the pink hearts though the ones i received were not as fluffy as the ones in the listing or as the ones in other customer photos i really liked the extra fluffiness in the listing and im disappointed that the ones i got arent fluffy also one of the hearts is misshapen and kind of flat they are still cute though,1
the double clasps are a good feature helping to make the fit secure the latches for adjusting the over the shoulder length are problematic the latch tends to catch on the fabric of the suspender and the spring is quite strong making it difficult to adjust i also found that the metal is a bit sharp making me wonder if my shirts fronts will survive the suspenders,2
not matching the picture what i ordered the product looks modified from the original,0
the socks are great quality but unfortunately the color is not black as advertised when worn with black shoes and black pants it looks dark blue,1
before purchase i contacted the seller about a couple colors actually showing up the seller replied very quickly about what colors i see are the colors ill get they were they are nice and shiny as polyester is i had to ding a star off for not being double sidedbr br being shiny might pose as a problem when tied as a mask and not holding firm but time will tell breathing is not obstructed so i dont need to worry about wearing a shiny blue bandana against very pale white skin and being mistaken for a having lack of oxygen,2
leather is scorched there are scorched spots all over the bag bag dept dimensions are slightly smaller than described its just ok,1
es un excelente producto se siente súper bien solo me gustaría el elástico de la cintura un poco más suave no tan ajustado por el resto es excelente,2
these 7995 slippers are falsely advertised as they did not come with gel insoles but came with dense foam insoles covered with synthetic lambs wool also the picture clearly shows that they have outer soles that are sewn together the ones i received were glued together sure they fit but how long would they last also the pair that i received appear to have been worn before and returned and then sold to me this is just another example of deception in its finest,0
a gift for my granddaughters birthday,1
i had to return this item it fit good from the top area the bottom was just way too loose,0
i ordered the largest size in the color taro the color is a bit unusual but could actually work as a year round bag i would describe it as a purplegray hue it is very soft there are many pockets and all the zippers work nicely and dont snag my skin when i place my hand in and out of them a major problem for me is that the lining is so black with an exact matching black zipper that i cannot see the zipper i have to feel for it i would also have liked to have the two little interior side slip pockets in the main compartment like i have in my other handbags they are so nice for tissues comb eyeglass cleaning cloth etc instead of them just being down inside of the bag if i decide to use this often i will probably get a little cosmetic bag to slip these items into so they arent just going around willynilly in the bottom of the bag one of the reasons i purchased this bag is because of its size the number of pockets i like my bag organized and the light weight it was listed as 11 ounces i havent weighed it yet but it is heavier than i thought it would be but not as heavy as my giani bernini organizer bags just an okay bag i thought i was really going to like it and would be ordering other colors but that isnt going to be happening fortunately it was not expensive so no great loss,1
so beautiful thats good,2
i consider this more of a jersey than a sweater it says its 65 cotton and 35 polyester but the material is shiny and slick so it seems much more polyester if not all than cotton it doesnt resemble any other sweater i have or tshirt other than that it comes in a lovely sage and white color and i do like the message on front,1
fits snug and cushy,2
first off these are great lookingbr second they fit wellbr third they do what theyre supposed tobr summary im very happy with these i read the other reviews which were helpful so im avoiding using the pull tab so i dont break it they come on just fine without it so this seems like a very minor quibble as it could happen with any shoe with a pull tabbr go for it these are great,2
i really like the comfort of the shoe and the price was great for prime day however i took a chance and ordered my normal size 8 and my toe was to the tippy top boo now i cant exchange as i lose that great price so a full return it is on these i would say size up by a 12 at least,2
the sneaker is cheaply made and not very comfortable,0
nice thick fabric fits well high waisted which i love pockets are great especially the hidden one in the waistband im 57 128lbs i got an extra small,2
loved that i found boot cut jeans with high waist as im older and dont care to have mid waist jeans pinching my middle nice stretch in fabric too i did cut an inch off and hemmed them to fit my leg length,2
the reason i didnt give 5 stars is because these didnt come in any kind of packaging you could return and they dont come with tags on them so i couldnt return them when i realized i chose the wrong size otherwise my husband loves these underwear,1
